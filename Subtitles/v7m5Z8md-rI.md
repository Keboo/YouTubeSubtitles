[okay and we are back so tonight my plan](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h01m54s)



[is to kick things off with more UI](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h01m58s)



[testing in the material design in zamel](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m01s)



[it was going to update people on where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m04s)



[I've gotten to ran into a few problems](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m06s)



[and so I decided to elicit some help](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m09s)



[from one of my brilliant co-workers Mike](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m11s)



[he will be popping on in a moment so yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m14s)



[so that is where we are going to be so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m18s)



[for people who are interested in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m20s)



[following along there's an outstanding](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m22s)



[PR on the material design and zamel](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m23s)



[project it is PR 1866 so you'll note](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m26s)



[this the actual source code for this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m31s)



[branch is coming from my fork so if you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m33s)



[are interested to actually follow along](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m35s)



[with that there it is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m38s)



[one other update that I wanted to make](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m40s)



[people aware up out on my Twitter I had](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m43s)



[actually posted I am going to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m47s)



[speaking at the Salt Lake City dotnet](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m50s)



[user group so for people who are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m54s)



[interested and actually here Mike let's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m56s)



[just bring you on there's Mike there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h02m58s)



[me so I will be speaking that will be a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m01s)



[week from today it's actually going to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m06s)



[be what is it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m09s)



[this is 5:30 mountain which is 4:30 my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m10s)



[time so it's three and a half hours](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m13s)



[before before normal streaming time if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m16s)



[that's confusing enough you can click in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m23s)



[if anybody is interested it is free and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m25s)



[open to everybody you do have to sign up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m27s)



[but that's about it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m29s)



[so if people are interested in that one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m30s)



[other thing I was going to make or make](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m33s)



[a comment of is I've gotten a lot of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m35s)



[questions from people about design](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m38s)



[principles and where do you go to like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m41s)



[you figured out how to write code where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m44s)



[do you go to learn how to actually write](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m46s)



[code better the simple answer is that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m47s)



[most of it comes from learning and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m50s)



[practicing various programming patterns](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m53s)



[and principles bear in mind this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m55s)



[where programming gets hard because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h03m58s)



[these are not hard and fast rules when](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m00s)



[you apply each of these is very](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m03s)



[subjective](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m06s)



[and needs to be applied appropriately to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m07s)



[your problem that you're trying to solve](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m09s)



[however most of the time these are good](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m12s)



[rules to live by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m16s)



[so dev IQ has a lot of them on here the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m17s)



[principles and patterns I really really](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m19s)



[like and quite often will link people to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m21s)



[various ones especially when I'm doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m24s)



[code reviews and see violations of them](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m26s)



[this is usually my go-to because their](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m28s)



[answers are simple short their language](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m30s)



[agnostic occasionally there's some small](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m33s)



[links or whatnot in them but really good](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m35s)



[stuff here okay that was a very long](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m38s)



[introduction I don't I'm normally not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m41s)



[that long-winded Mike I promise okay all](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m43s)



[right so let me let me show you what I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m47s)



[have built and by virtue of this and go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m49s)



[through and update everyone else on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m52s)



[where I'm at so in the material design](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m53s)



[project I have a UI test project okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m55s)



[nothing fancy it's a net core three one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h04m58s)



[unit test c-sharp a null ability turned](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m01s)



[on because yes right pulled in a lot of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m05s)



[pretty a lot of default stuff the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m10s)



[part that started to get interesting is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m14s)



[I now have two apps that I'm testing I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m16s)



[may get to three but I'm at two at least](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m20s)



[so first app is just a straight demo app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m23s)



[which I think you've seen in the past](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m26s)



[where its purpose in life is to go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m28s)



[through and show off all of the styles](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m30s)



[and what's available in material design](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m33s)



[right which is great I think I lost your](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m34s)



[video by the way did I lose you I hit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m37s)



[the wrong button I was trying to unmute](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m41s)



[myself oh okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m42s)



[so the first one is the demo app the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m45s)



[only thing I don't mind running UI test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m47s)



[through it like my my test for the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m49s)



[demo app is literally just click through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m52s)



[all the pages and verify that the app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m54s)



[doesn't blow up not a great UI test but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h05m57s)



[for a bare minimum start that's kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m00s)



[where I was leading right the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m02s)



[problem being is that I want to test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m06s)



[very specific UI cases and I don't think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m07s)



[and I don't want to code those into my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m10s)



[demo app I want the demo app to be about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m11s)



[showing off what what is there and not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m13s)



[necessarily showing off failure cases](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m16s)



[so to that end I went through and made a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m18s)



[UI test cases project](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m22s)



[so again WPF app I'm doing net core 31](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m24s)



[I'm pretty much ignoring testing the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m29s)



[full framework one because so far to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m31s)



[date there have been exactly zero bugs](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m33s)



[that have been tied to dotnet framework](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m35s)



[versus dotnet core make sense so I it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m38s)



[seems like a waste of effort to test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m42s)



[both sides so we could get to it I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m43s)



[in preview now isn't it so hopefully](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m48s)



[everyone is switching over soon yes but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m50s)



[I highly doubt that like I still get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m53s)



[people requesting XP support so ok that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h06m55s)



[framework isn't dying anytime soon as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m00s)



[far as I'm concerned so and more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m02s)



[importantly is I'm not gonna kill off](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m04s)



[support for frameworks that are still](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m06s)



[under Microsoft support and I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m07s)



[dotnet framework like 4:8 has like an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m09s)



[end-of-life of like 20 28 or something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m12s)



[and so like it's got a very very long](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m15s)



[end-of-life so short version I can't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m18s)



[kill it like I'm not gonna kill support](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m22s)



[for anything that Microsoft is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m23s)



[supporting so yeah whereas the dotnet](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m24s)



[core versions they only live for a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m29s)



[couple years and then they're dead right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m31s)



[so those we can keep revving so this guy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m33s)



[is in here there's the mvvm light libs](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m36s)



[because I decided I wanted to do mvvm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m38s)



[I'm surprised this thing's still](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m42s)



[squawking at me I thought I put in the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m44s)



[end u7 unless not a check that in I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m45s)



[gonna say I should have had the the know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m50s)



[warrant on the Nu 1701 to tell it to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m52s)



[stop pestering me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m55s)



[there it goes little yellow triangle](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m56s)



[away so this guy is all about and I'll](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h07m58s)



[aspire this guy up and show you because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m00s)



[this is where I think I I want to focus](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m02s)



[my efforts yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m04s)



[so the hence the two namespaces down in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m07s)



[my UI test one one for demo app and one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m09s)



[for UI test cases stop debugging I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m12s)



[apparently am in release mode I would I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m17s)



[had an issue and I I thought it was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m19s)



[related to debug versus release so I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m21s)



[confirming that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m24s)



[turns out I didn't that was not the case](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m26s)



[nice I was not that stupid okay so let's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m28s)



[see here ba thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m34s)



[has to recompile since I changed the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m37s)



[framework and launched and of course it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m39s)



[launches on the wrong screen okay so you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m42s)



[can't see it but there's a grid here two](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m45s)



[columns to rows right left column has a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m48s)



[list of potential failure cases right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m51s)



[you click it it loads something into the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m54s)



[right panel there's technically this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m57s)



[execute because a lot of tests are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h08m59s)



[likely going to need some sort of setup](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m02s)



[or going or something to indicate and go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m03s)



[and do the thing right so we can click](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m07s)



[execute this guy here the actual thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m08s)



[for the UI elements to test you can test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m12s)



[overlay which all this button does is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m15s)



[increment a counter okay you can do show](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m17s)



[dialog and the key part is when the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m20s)



[dialog shown I should not be able to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m23s)



[click past it yeah because I tried to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m24s)



[pick on something where we've actually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m27s)



[seen a bug before on this and this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m28s)



[something that has come up right so I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m30s)



[shouldn't be able to click past I can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m33s)



[close it and then I can click it again](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m34s)



[so this is the whole thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m36s)



[if you hit execute test it just resets](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m37s)



[the thing to zero just to make sure if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m39s)



[we redo things or whatever every execute](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m41s)



[kind of just puts everything back into a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m44s)



[clean State so that's the sum total of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m46s)



[the app not a complicated app right so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m48s)



[then the test case for it I did look](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m52s)



[similar to this so the structure with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m56s)



[the test case base I might show you this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h09m59s)



[real quick so I have this app class](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m02s)



[where I have coated in the paths to the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m05s)



[apps okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m08s)



[relative you'll note I did a little](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m09s)



[fanciness to be able to be intelligent](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m11s)



[about debug versus release because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m13s)



[reasons mm-hmm alright so those go in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m15s)



[there that's all there the actual test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m18s)



[base class probably looks familiar to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m23s)



[you actually I think I can whack this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m25s)



[now yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m27s)



[can that got moved out this guy comes in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m28s)



[does your typical set up there's there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m33s)



[a few fancy things that I did learn so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m36s)



[one win app driver is only being done in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m39s)



[debug currently because on the pipeline](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m42s)



[we're running in release mode so I did](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m46s)



[not ever want to try and start this on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m50s)



[my pipeline so hands off hands off hands](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m52s)



[off this is probably overkill and not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m54s)



[necessary](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m57s)



[I had it start waiting for the basically](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h10m59s)



[pause and wait until it can actually hit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m03s)



[that socket just as a way of making it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m05s)



[pause I know I've seen other patterns](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m08s)



[where people loop and do other kinds of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m09s)



[things you know yeah this works for now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m11s)



[so that is how I'm starting the win app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m14s)



[driver start the app this is where it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m17s)



[got a little fancy because if you spin](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m20s)



[the process yourself and call process](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m23s)



[start you are responsible for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m25s)



[terminating it on the pipeline or your](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m28s)



[pipeline hangs forever and it took me a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m29s)



[while to figure out what I had done](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m32s)



[wrong cuz I had clearly done something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m33s)



[wrong I just I didn't couldn't figure](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m35s)



[out what and my pipe hung and after 15](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m37s)



[minutes I'm like there's no way my test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m40s)



[is still running okay and just look](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m41s)



[there is a very fine line between](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m45s)



[wedding when out driver and web and not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m47s)



[and in my exhibitor iver can start the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m49s)



[app for me to it it can but there's some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m52s)



[there's some limitations around it there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h11m57s)



[is a hold on it's been a while since](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m01s)



[I've had to think about this Thursday I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m04s)



[believe it's a hard-coded](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m07s)



[wait time to where if your app doesn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m10s)



[start within a certain amount of time it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m13s)



[just fails and so in about half the apps](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m15s)



[that that we've tested they take longer](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m19s)



[than that time to start so we have to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m21s)



[start up our own process and manage it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m25s)



[that way interesting so on one hand I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m27s)



[would hope that my app wouldn't do that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m30s)



[but on the other hand I write I could](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m32s)



[certainly see things hey Kenny](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m34s)



[so yeah so there so so that that is how](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m39s)



[I am starting my apps and passing those](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m43s)



[through right so I'm just doing some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m45s)



[fancy stuff the process info having to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m47s)



[append the directory separator character](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m50s)



[at the end of it is dumb but necessary](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m52s)



[believe me I was annoyed at that I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h12m57s)



[believe this falls in just some changes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m01s)



[that they made around pathing and dotnet](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m03s)



[core but don't quote me on that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m05s)



[so yeah so that is that is the whole](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m07s)



[setup here so the next obvious question](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m12s)



[is what problems are we experiencing I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m14s)



[glad you asked since you clearly did](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m18s)



[let's go and I let me show you the build](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m21s)



[pipeline so sorry I'm trying to find the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m25s)



[snippet of code when I'm driver manage](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m28s)



[your application real quick is there it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m30s)



[so on that note is there a cheater way](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m33s)



[what do you what are your key search](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m36s)



[terms for this because I've been doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m38s)



[things like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m40s)



[appium WPF etc etc etc so is there any](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m40s)



[smarter way of doing this not really](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m45s)



[because it's kind of a blurry gray area](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m48s)



[where there are certain things that are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m52s)



[there appium things that you have to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h13m57s)



[search for there's certain things that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m01s)



[are actually selenium things you have to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m02s)



[search for that's pretty rare because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m04s)



[you know selenium is mostly web-based](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m06s)



[there is web-based excuse me but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m09s)



[typically if I'm searching for something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m12s)



[I'll do win app driver and then do the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m15s)



[search and that will usually bring it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m18s)



[back to either a p.m. or went out driver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m21s)



[and then if you post something really](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m23s)



[obtuse on the win up driver github](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m26s)



[there's a good chance that out I'll be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m28s)



[the one that answers it I try to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m31s)



[pretty active on there I haven't been in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m32s)



[the last month or so but oh I didn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m34s)



[realize that I try to be pretty active](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m35s)



[on the win out driver github note to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m37s)



[self so I've definitely been searching](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m41s)



[through it I didn't notice you but I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m43s)



[wasn't digging that issue list so yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m45s)



[say like I said I haven't posted an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m47s)



[issue](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m48s)



[list in a month ish but usually I try to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m49s)



[pick the ones that haven't been answered](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m53s)



[and then trying to answer them oh good](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m55s)



[to know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h14m59s)



[cuz you are clearly the guy I need with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m00s)



[questions because I have lots of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m03s)



[questions so I just put in chat got it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m05s)



[so that might be the old way](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m10s)



[sorry selenium deprecated how they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m14s)



[handle capabilities so let me see if I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m16s)



[can find my appropriate place to put](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m20s)



[this I would think that that would go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m22s)



[somewhere in the is additional](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m25s)



[capabilities oh yeah right there so yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m27s)



[so so basically this changes so I've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m30s)



[already got kind of something right so I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m33s)



[would do you know this this right yep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m35s)



[and so this would I would ultimately](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m39s)



[feed this my usually at path right yep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m41s)



[and the API has apparently changed to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m47s)



[that and that yeah and then you were](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m51s)



[using the term session but yeah it's a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m55s)



[driver session it yeah I honestly I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h15m59s)



[switched between them depending on how](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m02s)



[I'm feeling when I setup a project](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m04s)



[that's permit you won't have to have if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m05s)



[I remember right you shouldn't have to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m10s)



[have app top-level window that's only so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m11s)



[oh because that's that's if you spin](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m14s)



[your own process right so that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m17s)



[literally getting your desktop and then](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m19s)



[saying hey give me everything that's a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m21s)



[child of the desktop which in this case](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m23s)



[this Shamir app starts up soon enough](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m25s)



[well in this case I think when I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m28s)



[grabbing it so the the pointer I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m30s)



[kicking back is actually the main window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m32s)



[handle from the process that I spent so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m33s)



[nice case it should be just my main](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m36s)



[window which I was curious to see if you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m38s)



[do this how does it handle child windows](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m42s)



[if I shout it to a window handle right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m44s)



[so if you need that's where it's kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m48s)



[interesting because if you need a trial](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m52s)



[window of your main app window the two](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m53s)



[ways I know of for searching for it are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h16m58s)



[either just do a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m00s)



[element off your parent your your main](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m02s)



[window it'll show us a child of my main](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m05s)



[window interested yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m09s)



[sorry there's three ways so either do a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m12s)



[find element off your main window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m15s)



[because it might be a child depending on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m16s)



[how its coded if it's a modal dialog you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m19s)



[can explicitly search for modal dialog](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m22s)



[windows the third option is if it's a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m24s)



[sibling tier main window then you have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m27s)



[to do that app top-level window got a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m30s)



[desktop session your your root session](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m33s)



[sorry](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m37s)



[get your root session then get the app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m37s)



[top-level window and it's kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m39s)



[convoluted but it actually works pretty](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m43s)



[nice once it's set up yeah there's a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m45s)



[comment here that fine child element is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m47s)



[the the magical invocation API for that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m49s)



[mm-hmm okay but in in this case you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m52s)



[shouldn't need that app top-level window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m55s)



[since it so yeah so if I spin it this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h17m57s)



[way okay so we're gonna we're gonna try](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m01s)



[this because this would theoretically is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m03s)



[significantly reduced my overhead right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m06s)



[because I no longer have to do that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m09s)



[I'm gonna leave the start win app driver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m11s)



[for local debug because that's just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m13s)



[really convenient for me yeah yes yes it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m15s)



[is and you'll note I I had to get a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m18s)



[little creative too with it because I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m20s)



[don't install things to see : I have my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m22s)



[C Drive as tiny so nice](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m27s)



[I had to yeah cuz D Colin's a thing and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m30s)



[I tried honey like I got desperate I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m38s)



[like there has to be a smarter way than](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m40s)



[just hard coding this whole path right I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m42s)



[was like and I went hunting for registry](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m43s)



[stuff I would look at examples I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m45s)



[couldn't find anything no I was like I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m47s)



[convinced there's an option somewhere](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m51s)



[because there something knows about the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m53s)



[installed applications my only options I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m56s)



[found were things like hunting through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h18m59s)



[the Start menu stuff which isn't going](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m02s)



[to work I tried looking for the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m03s)



[installed stuff in the registry and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m05s)



[unfortunately all it does is it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m07s)



[reference it doesn't reference where it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m09s)



[installed to it references the location](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m11s)



[of the cached MSI to do the uninstall](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m14s)

[driver because I'd love to have it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m27s)



[started obviously on a pipeline it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m28s)



[doesn't matter we aren't going to use it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m30s)



[we're gonna try this for now so hold on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m32s)



[I'd also this duplicated that so we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m36s)



[don't need that anymore mm-hmm okay so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m38s)



[I'm gonna leave a comment here only](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m42s)



[needed if we start our own process right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m45s)



[or if you don't own the process for some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m51s)



[reasons ah de yada yada okay so the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m53s)



[the problem in question right so I'll](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m56s)



[spoil the surprise the tests usually run](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h19m59s)



[fine locally however I have seen these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m01s)



[same failures locally so in question](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m04s)



[what I have is so it's trying to do it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m07s)



[trying to run my my dialogue host test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m10s)



[right and so it's going through when](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m12s)



[it's shown overlay prevents clicking](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m14s)



[yada yada yada](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m16s)



[great great great and the the key thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m17s)



[here that I'll note is the line number](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m20s)



[on the test so the line number on the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m21s)



[test is line 24 and I haven't changed](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m24s)



[this since it's in that so that should](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m26s)



[line up so right here so the result text](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m29s)



[block and well we'll get back to some of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m32s)



[my other tests here in a moment too but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m35s)



[let me let me just ctrl f5 this guy real](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m36s)



[quick so I can have him running and show](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m39s)



[show you what up what what I think is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m42s)



[happening because I also have some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m45s)



[questions on setting this up in my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m46s)



[sample so specifically he's gone click](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m47s)



[here click here and then he goes hunting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m51s)



[for this text block now one I would have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m55s)



[assumed that click here click here would](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m58s)



[have been enough time for this thing to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h20m59s)



[show up since it shows up on here but it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m01s)



[does go really really fast so there is a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m04s)



[chance that it is just going really](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m06s)



[really fast because these clicks like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m08s)



[you know when I'm doing it I've got some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m10s)



[amount of time there's a ripple](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m12s)



[animation yadda yadda yadda like it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m13s)



[wouldn't shock me if you did all of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m16s)



[those clicks at the speed of CPU that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m17s)



[this wasn't loaded yet right because it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m19s)



[it's not for WPF it's gonna set the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m22s)



[control but it's got to wait for the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m25s)



[next layout and render pass before it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m27s)



[actually going to turn](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m29s)



[so it ran through this so we so it found](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m29s)



[that so I've got this helper thing on my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m34s)



[main window class that lets me find test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m35s)



[cases in here all right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m38s)



[it found it it clicked on the test case](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m39s)



[found the execute button clicked on that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m41s)



[and then went to find this the thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m43s)



[that wasn't loaded initially which is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m46s)



[wise inspect to fail and it blows up now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m48s)



[my initial thing that I had done is I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m51s)



[went and set this timeout to five](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m53s)



[seconds right doesn't seem to work yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h21m55s)



[implicit waits are they I don't like to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m01s)



[use them they they work in kind of not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m07s)



[best-case scenarios but in kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m12s)



[average scenarios but they really fall](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m13s)



[apart when you have to fine-tune your](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m15s)



[weights so in this specific case it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m17s)



[gonna wait five seconds for everything](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m21s)



[so and I was actually gonna be okay with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m26s)



[that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m30s)



[except for this thing timed out mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m30s)



[and I have a hard time believing that my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m34s)



[test timeout and I've got other builds](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m37s)



[on this pipeline where this test pass is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m39s)



[just fine okay so that's the part that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m43s)



[bothering me the most is it seems like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m45s)



[the more I run the pipeline I'm just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m47s)



[rolling the dice and I don't want to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m51s)



[merge these things in right when they're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m52s)



[gonna just randomly like a test that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m55s)



[randomly fails gets ignored and then](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h22m57s)



[it's right it's not even worth](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m00s)



[maintaining yeah yeah totally agreed so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m01s)



[the way the way I would recommend going](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m06s)



[about fixing this or addressing this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m08s)



[ditch the implicit way and we'll use an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m11s)



[Elvis fate so actually hang on I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m14s)



[realizing something come back to the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m16s)



[explicit weight cuz I'm sorry I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m21s)



[derail you one second I I'm realizing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m22s)



[that I may have checked in a halfway](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m24s)



[point and that may be partially to blame](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m25s)



[here but I do have things showing that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m29s)



[case of the timeouts so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m32s)



[so here is the actual UI elements for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m37s)



[this guy right and due to dues so this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m41s)



[is the this is the dialogue that gets](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m48s)



[shown itself this is the text block here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m49s)



[ah yeah okay this is so this is one of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m52s)



[the things I wanted to ask about and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m57s)



[this is gonna test your WPF knowledge](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h23m59s)



[then a little bit automation properties](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m01s)



[name vs automation ID yes can you break](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m03s)



[those down because right now I feel like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m07s)



[I'm rolling the dice and picking one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m09s)



[yeah so I'm not sure if I think it can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m10s)



[quite explain this in WPF language but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m16s)



[in win app driver land or in automated](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m19s)



[testing land name we more commonly see](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m22s)



[associated to like in okay button](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m27s)



[the name is almost always also okay so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m30s)



[it doesn't quite correspond to text but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m34s)



[usually we see those things correspond](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m39s)



[where automation ID is literally](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m41s)



[anything you want it to be now if you're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m44s)



[not using the name for anything then I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m48s)



[don't believe it matters we tend to like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m51s)



[to use automation ID just because it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m56s)



[its own separate thing someone's not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h24m58s)



[gonna come back in and change it on us](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m00s)



[and it you know we can make them unique](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m03s)



[basically so and this is where I got a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m06s)



[little confused because I ran into the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m09s)



[issue of heroes so I've got the thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m12s)



[running right let me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m16s)



[what is the name of the lust](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m19s)



[accessibility tools versus insights yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m21s)



[the magical I want to put a blue box on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m24s)



[your app and I need to know end yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m26s)



[update later I don't feel like updating](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m29s)



[right to second it sounds like a bad](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m31s)



[idea](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m33s)



[okay so if we look at this guy right huh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m34s)



[so and here's where I was starting to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m37s)



[get a little weirded out so I've got](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m39s)



[this automation ID here all right but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m43s)



[the what was a name name and this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m46s)



[confused me name seems to court this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m50s)



[name here seems to correlate to the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m53s)



[text of the text the text block that now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h25m56s)



[it gets a little more weird for me where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m04s)



[if I so if I go up here right this guy I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m07s)



[ended up setting on automation](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m12s)



[properties name on because without it it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m14s)



[wasn't lining up to what I accept to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m17s)



[what I expected so I was very confused](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m20s)



[as to when to use each typical typical](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m22s)



[scenario is always use automation ID](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m27s)



[because the name and this is the part](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m29s)



[where I probably need to learn more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m32s)



[about WPF but I know which I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m34s)



[switch these two buttons then real quick](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m38s)



[because I would like to use automation I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m39s)



[do oh dear hints highlight it off please](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m43s)



[go away from and I think so and I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m46s)



[you had just dot ID you it needs to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m53s)



[dot automation ID oh thank you yep yep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m56s)



[and this is where I probably need to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h26m59s)



[learn more about the VPS but I know the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m02s)



[name is not like there's waste over I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m04s)



[like that X colon name I've used before](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m07s)



[and that propagates to the automation](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m10s)



[name but I don't know if it's overridden](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m13s)



[like that's the part where I probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m15s)



[really need to learn more about WPF yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m17s)



[cuz there's clearly a hierarchy between](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m19s)



[all of these things and I don't know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m21s)



[what that hierarchy is okay so proof is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m23s)



[in the pudding let's run these tests](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m26s)



[so I very intentionally did not put a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m31s)



[dependency between these projects so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m38s)



[that it can compile the unit test but oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m40s)



[it's probably going to try and compile](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m41s)



[the other one because I changed those](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m43s)



[automation IDs and you're probably gonna](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m44s)



[fail Oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m47s)



[build succeeded is it gonna go oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m49s)



[stinking its thinking](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h27m57s)



[I I may have may have shot myself in the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m04s)



[foot there test Explorer yeah so you and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m06s)



[so and this is so this may actually be a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m12s)



[legitimate failure and this huh let's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m15s)



[see what did you fail on line 28 so yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m19s)



[so this is where I started running into](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m25s)



[problems because it seemed like so find](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m26s)



[element by accessibility ID right I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m30s)



[using the same thing two elements side](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m33s)



[by side right and the problem I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h28m36s)

[recompile this guy because there isn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m11s)



[there isn't a dependency between these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m13s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m17s)



[okay so there is a very real chance that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m17s)



[it just forgets to compile and just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m20s)



[starts the old one mm-hmm because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m22s)



[reasons but I have found it convenient](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m26s)



[especially when writing the test to just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m28s)



[be able to leave the app running and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m30s)



[yeah I think at some point I might get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m32s)



[to the point where I do a tell Visual](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h29m35s)

[is that the automation Ibiza that is the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m03s)



[automation test overlay button right so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m06s)



[test overlay button but yet that also](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m09s)



[appears to be the one that it failed to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m12s)



[find let me rerun the test just to make](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m15s)



[sure that I am NOT crazy because there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m17s)



[is a reasonable chance that I am crazy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m19s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m21s)



[also selenium is really finicky oh yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m23s)



[hmm I found that it oh so that was fun](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m28s)



[it apparently decided to open my email](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m35s)



[and more importantly it conveniently](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m38s)



[relaunched a new version of the app yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m43s)



[so that oh because we're no I'm no](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m46s)



[longer in charge of the process right so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m49s)



[what I that snippet of code I gave you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m51s)



[will relaunch every single time there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m54s)



[are ways around that but kind of the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h30m57s)



[typical behavior is the assumption that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m01s)



[you're going to launch a new version of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m04s)



[the app every time to make sure it's a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m05s)



[clean instance got it okay so real quick](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m07s)



[question on what the goal is for tonight](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m11s)



[so right now my my ideal goal would be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m13s)



[to fix my tests so that they are stable](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m15s)



[so that this PR can merge that would be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m18s)



[my ultimate goal it would there I've got](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m20s)



[other questions of how to add more tests](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m24s)



[to test other things but ultimately if I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m26s)



[could get this one UI test working ok so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m28s)



[Li can I ask you to reshow me something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m31s)



[you already showed me I will show you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m35s)



[anything you'd like hit me can you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m36s)



[really watch the app but but don't do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m38s)



[anything once it's launched I just know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m41s)



[it's being filming it between different](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m46s)



[screens I want to make sure I saw ok so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m48s)



[this is the empty state of the app I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m52s)



[have been a little clicky clicky so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m53s)



[what's the first step that happens so as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m56s)



[far as part of the UI test the first](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h31m58s)



[step is click the item in the list which](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m00s)



[I know populates the the right portion I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m02s)



[realize I'm pointing to my monitor and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m05s)



[you can't see](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m07s)



[where my fingers pointing so I'll use my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m07s)



[cursor I'm inferring thank you so it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m10s)



[clicks there it clicks execute which how](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m13s)



[to clean app launch is pretty minimal](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m16s)



[because or I should say doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m18s)



[because it's all that does is reset the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m20s)



[clicks to zero uh-huh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m23s)



[it then goes through and test the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m25s)



[overlay so it does a click and verifies](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m28s)



[the discount increments to one okay it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m29s)



[does a show dialog to pop the dialogue](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m32s)



[over the top it then tries to click this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m36s)



[button again verifies that the click did](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m39s)



[not increment closes the dialogue clicks](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m42s)



[the button again and then flies this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m48s)



[went to two yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m51s)



[so when it typically fails on the first](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m51s)



[test over way quick so the ones that I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m56s)



[yeah though two failures that I have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h32m58s)



[seen and and maybe I'm and maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m01s)



[conflating a few things because I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m05s)



[given that I think I may have checked in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m08s)



[with that implicit wait and had that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m10s)



[automation ID failure may have just been](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m14s)



[miss reading my bugs and thinking I had](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m17s)



[a bug that I didn't have that is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m18s)



[possible the two failure cases that have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m20s)



[been the most problematic have been](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m25s)



[initially grabbing the text block okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m26s)



[or grabbing the button because reasons](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m30s)



[also no ability and win app driver or](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m34s)



[appium you know I correcting the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m37s)



[assumption that this method will return](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m41s)



[me an element or throw yes that is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m43s)



[correct okay that was my assumption](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m46s)



[based on look looking at the behavior it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m48s)



[means that now all of my statements and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m50s)



[in exclamations so I get to have my code](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m51s)



[yelling all the time nice great yeah and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h33m56s)



[and that's where the explicit versus](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m00s)



[implicit way comes in that for the if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m03s)



[I'm understanding right lines 24 and 28](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m08s)



[so the real quick](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m15s)



[rolling back to implicit versus explicit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m18s)



[way and so the implicit wit that you had](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m20s)



[there's nothing inherently wrong with it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m23s)



[you're telling at the very lowest levels](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m25s)



[selenium that anytime you do a thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m29s)



[with selenium if it doesn't succeed](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m34s)



[right away retry for five seconds I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m37s)



[don't remember exactly what the polling](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m39s)



[interval is but essentially it's polling](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m40s)



[is what it's doing okay makes sense so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m43s)



[nothing inherently wrong with that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m46s)



[divide it wait for some period of time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m47s)



[try again right the challenge with that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m49s)



[is it makes it impossible actually to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m52s)



[tailor those weights for different](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m55s)



[scenarios so in your case that first](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h34m57s)



[click on line 21 if you know that is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m01s)



[always going to work as soon as the app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m05s)



[loads and it should fail if it doesn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m07s)



[the implicit way it's kind of a bad bad](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m09s)



[thing there because if something happens](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m11s)



[and there's a fog where the click](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m14s)



[doesn't work it will always wait five](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m15s)



[seconds before it fails out which on one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m17s)



[test is out of a deal on 500 test that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m19s)



[icy so because I know something about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m24s)



[how long each of these calls should take](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m26s)



[right and that's where the explicit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m28s)



[weights come in in my opinion as the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m31s)



[best option because you can tailor your](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m35s)



[weights for each scenario because there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m37s)



[that is a that is a bit of a problem](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m41s)



[that I that I will have like for example](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m42s)



[this show dialogue the whole thing I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m45s)



[think takes a third of a second to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m48s)



[finish animating this dialogue should be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m50s)



[blocking clicks after like less than](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m53s)



[maybe a hundred milliseconds I'd have to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m56s)



[look exactly what it is but the moment](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h35m59s)



[this thing's opacity starts animating](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m01s)



[off zero it should be blocking clicks so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m03s)



[it's fairly fast but there is some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m05s)



[amount of time that it needs to wait](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m08s)



[before trying to come over because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m11s)



[obviously this close button isn't there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m13s)



[right away it has some animation time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m14s)



[and it's about a third of a second which](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m16s)



[I set that implicit weight to five and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m19s)



[now you're making me want to go back and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m21s)



[change it and make it significantly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m23s)



[lower right right I think that's your](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m24s)



[goal good work oh thank you and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m28s)



[that's just travels with implicit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m32s)



[weights is the implicit weight has to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m33s)



[as long as whatever the longest action](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m35s)



[is going to take so it's I can say for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m39s)



[certain that inside of the library I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m43s)



[might have to go check the transitioner](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m47s)



[I'm fairly confident that every](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m49s)



[animation in the library is less than a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m52s)



[second long okay I mean obviously](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m54s)



[outside of like infinite progress bars](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m57s)



[and whatnot in those guide types of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h36m59s)



[things which don't care but the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m01s)



[animation toggling between states I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m03s)



[think in any visual state manager I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m05s)



[don't think anything's longer than a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m08s)



[second and I think most of them are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m09s)



[under half a second okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m11s)



[so I think I think maybe starting here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m13s)



[is probably reasonable because I I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m18s)



[that's do you know what this thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m19s)



[defaults to if you don't set it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m22s)



[explicitly yeah then there is no way so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m25s)



[if you do it'll just die immediately](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m30s)



[right yeah so if you whack my on 37 it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m32s)



[just gonna barf](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m35s)



[whenever I can't find something or](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m36s)



[whenever I can't click on something or](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m38s)



[got it that makes sense okay I think I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m41s)



[do like this thing running this I'm a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m45s)



[little torn in the interest of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m49s)



[simplicity so in the interest of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m51s)



[simplicity for tonight I think using](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m52s)



[this is probably nicer simply because it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m55s)



[lets me leave the app running mm-hmm and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h37m58s)



[I know that this and I know that I've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m01s)



[set up my execute to reset my state](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m03s)



[right and honestly I usually set](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m04s)



[something like that up when I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m08s)



[debugging anyway just so I don't have to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m09s)



[rerun the whole test yeah cuz that yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m12s)



[that I think that makes a little more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m15s)

[trying there is a Windows command where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m20s)



[you can tell windows this is the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m22s)



[starting position of this app please](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m25s)



[always restart it here seriously yes oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m27s)



[I need to look up what it was it was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m30s)



[posted by Kendra the Microsoft PM for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m33s)



[the testing stuff in Visual Studio and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m38s)



[don't remember what it was I might have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m42s)



[to go back](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m43s)



[look at her twitter kendra havens i](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m44s)



[think is how you say her last name](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m47s)



[thanks god heap is the twitter handle](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m49s)



[for anybody who wants to go look her up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m52s)



[great stuff most of it all related to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m54s)



[the the testing stuff in visual studio](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m56s)



[so if you've got questions on that she's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h38m58s)



[got answers okay so let's let's talk to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m00s)



[that explicit wait then so if i wanted](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m06s)



[to implement an explicit wait i assume](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m08s)



[it's all around this find and this kind](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m10s)



[of falls back to what you had built](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m12s)



[before right right and it's this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m14s)



[where selenium in general starts to get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m18s)



[really interesting because they're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m22s)



[they're explicitly there's actually two](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m25s)



[of them there's the what's called](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m29s)



[webdriver wait but then there's also](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m31s)



[what's called a fluent weight as far as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m33s)



[I can tell a fluent weight is just a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m36s)



[webdriver weight with fluent syntax as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m38s)



[far as I can tell so pick your poison I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m40s)



[usually just do a straight webdriver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m43s)



[wait but essentially what it is and we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m45s)



[actually paired on something very](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m49s)



[similar Jewish years ago years ago it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h39m51s)



[was actually Chris Finlayson found a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m06s)



[post from the the primary c-sharp](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m08s)



[maintainer who was like you know hey no](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m10s)



[this is silly years here's how you use a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m13s)



[webdriver wait but it's all based on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m15s)



[delegates so you know technically have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m17s)



[to hand in justified element by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m20s)



[accessibility ID you can and in anything](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m23s)



[you want I've handed in handed in entire](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m25s)



[statements that are alike click this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m29s)



[verify this and then click this other](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m31s)



[thing because if in certain apps if you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m32s)



[don't do all three of those everything](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m36s)



[fails so I I've created an explicit wait](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m38s)



[that does those three things but anyway](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m41s)



[long story long all of those are driven](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m45s)



[through the webdriver weight class so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m47s)



[before why](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m51s)



[well ah there's the magic sauce okay yep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m54s)



[sorry yes yep so I go up here right and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h40m57s)



[new up web web driver wait and you'll](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m03s)



[want a hand in or you will need to hand](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m08s)



[in the driver and I believe the wait oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m10s)



[yeah the time out driver times in you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m11s)



[can also change the polling interval I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m17s)



[believe that's one of the overloads if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m19s)



[you care but it's it's the default is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m22s)



[100 or 250 milliseconds I don't remember](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m30s)



[which it's a small enough interval and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m33s)



[almost never change it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m36s)



[so the first parameter here wants a an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m38s)



[IKE lock what is it where do I get an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m41s)



[eye clock from so the the two overloads](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m42s)



[right is the first one the simple driver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m47s)



[and a timeout yeah that's that's the one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m50s)



[I that I pretty much always use the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m52s)



[other one takes in a clock and I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m54s)



[know where to get a clock from yeah I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h41m57s)



[don't know either](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m01s)



[our clock it's new clock what's the can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m01s)



[you go back system clock that's that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m07s)



[nice like is there a reason I can't just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m11s)



[reuse this sucker on this thing it is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m14s)



[uses the system clock to calculate time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m18s)



[for China](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m20s)



[that's just so it's literally](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m21s)



[abstracting date/time down now got it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m23s)



[okay I this is kind of fun though](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m26s)



[because right I could have fun with this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m30s)



[interface is now before later bye oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m33s)



[that is hilarious this oh okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m40s)



[side note small tangent right whenever I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m43s)



[see interfaces that look like this this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m46s)



[feels like these should be extension](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m49s)



[methods right cuz I'm pretty sure all](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m51s)



[implementations are probably gonna do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m55s)



[the exact same thing and the only thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m57s)



[these things that at least my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h42m59s)



[implementation of these methods all I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m01s)



[would need access to is now yeah and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m03s)



[then you keep your interface now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m05s)



[since in no protip for people thin](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m07s)



[interfaces also that's the answer to one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m10s)



[of my questions in my talk next week so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m15s)



[I am going to actually go all the way](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m17s)



[down into my test base and I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m21s)



[just do this real quick well I like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m23s)



[while I'm adding this thing so protect](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m26s)



[it I clock clock clock Spelling's hard](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m28s)



[don't judge me um what was it I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m37s)



[telling my wife something tonight and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m42s)



[was like I can't even spell it and then](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m44s)



[I and then I proceeded to get my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m46s)



[spelling wrong she's like yeah I believe](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m49s)



[you know yeah it happens especially when](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m52s)



[people are watching I know I wonder if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m55s)



[that means a lot of people are watching](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m58s)



[the general rule is the more people that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h43m59s)



[watch the right so time span from](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m02s)



[milliseconds so I'm gonna make this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m07s)



[thing pull so if this thing sleeps for a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m09s)



[hundred milliseconds that means I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m11s)



[roughly gonna pull probably 10 ish times](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m12s)



[right I know something about the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m14s)



[underlying time api's and C sharp and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m17s)



[their accuracy I think it's like a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m20s)



[hundred nanoseconds so this will](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m22s)



[probably get me pretty close mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m24s)



[again 100 might be I don't remember](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m27s)



[exactly what the default is but it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m30s)



[it's small enough that I'd pretty much](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m32s)



[never you don't ever change it for the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m34s)



[applications that we test which are you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m37s)



[know slow corporate desktop apps well](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m40s)



[this is material design we build fast](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m45s)



[pretty looking applications here fair](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m47s)



[enough okay so then what do I do with my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m49s)



[weight my new wonderful weight so now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m52s)



[you have to tell it which exceptions to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m55s)



[ignore because again as you pointed out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m57s)



[earlier find out will meant by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h44m59s)



[accessibility ID will either return an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m00s)



[element or throw so you have to ignore](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m02s)



[exception types so this feel this feels](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m05s)



[yucky yeah oh it's gonna get worse](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m09s)



[oh we're writing an extension method so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m12s)



[can't do I really because there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m14s)



[basically one exception type right like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m16s)



[the vast majority of times when I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m18s)



[see failures it's where is it scroll](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m21s)



[over webdriver exception yeah this thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m25s)



[yeah like so this is like the only thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m28s)



[it knows how to throw so here's here's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m31s)



[my small rant here's my big beef with I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m34s)



[don't know if it's appium or went up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m39s)



[driver I don't know which one of this if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m41s)



[you deal with straight selenium selenium](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m44s)



[Willam will throw informative exceptions](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m47s)



[find element if it fails we'll throw](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m50s)



[away no such element found exception](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m53s)



[it's an element is found but it can't be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m55s)



[clipped on it will throw element not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h45m58s)



[interactable exception either a p.m. or](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m00s)



[win app driver I'm not sure which so I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m07s)



[don't I don't want to speculate one of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m10s)



[them basically wraps all of those in a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m12s)



[webdriver exception and it may cuz they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m17s)



[do they do yeah thank you kidding yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m20s)



[in it and it makes I as you're about to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m23s)



[find out it makes handling exceptions](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m26s)



[really annoying because it's like well](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m30s)



[what if I only want to catch when](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m32s)



[there's no element what if the overlay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m35s)



[is there and it's not supposed to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m37s)



[then I want to throw right away so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m38s)



[anyway so it makes it makes handling](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m39s)



[exceptions specifically with desktop](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m43s)



[apps annoying yeah I'm sort of curious](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m45s)



[there might be a way over as you say if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m50s)



[you'll indulge me for one moment](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m53s)



[I actually I am curious do you know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m55s)



[about so I agree that it's throwing a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h46m57s)



[really horrid horrid exception right but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m00s)



[I'm curious to look at if there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m04s)



[anything in the safe ooh and not found](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m06s)



[right I'm curious to know if there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m13s)



[anything in like the exception data that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m15s)



[would actually contain information about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m18s)



[it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m20s)



[just just hypothetical yeah no this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m22s)



[great because I I I started to look into](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m26s)



[this once but I don't remember what I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m29s)



[found you found that you hated webdriver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m31s)



[exception yeah yeah yeah and a soapbox](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m34s)



[yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m39s)



[so thinking thinking click click and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m41s)



[then boom okay so it did throw the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m44s)



[exception](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m48s)



[let's go looking at what we have what I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m49s)



[need to figure out why my my extension](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m53s)



[doesn't edit this one so on my exception](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m55s)



[I I am in fact a webdriver exception](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h47m58s)



[which is awesome the inner exception is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m05s)



[null which is yeah awesome that's right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m07s)



[that's what it is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m10s)



[filter by message because the message](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m11s)



[tells you but yeah and this guy here is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m13s)



[so there's nothing in the data which is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m19s)



[overly not helpful mmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m22s)



[just great so there's there's basically](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m25s)



[nothing so something I mean I would](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m29s)



[start working my this unpack and throw](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m36s)



[on air](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m38s)



[I might hunt that method right that one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m39s)



[seems to be highly problematic but okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m44s)



[so this guy is throwing win app driver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m46s)



[my well yeah so one of these guys might](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m52s)



[need to receive a pull request from me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m57s)



[at some point right and possibly appium](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h48m58s)



[yeah and that's where yeah I'm mulling](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m02s)



[about there's some weird like IPC](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m06s)



[process communication going on but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m09s)



[mmm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m10s)



[that is yucky because clearly those](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m11s)



[other exception types exist so right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m14s)



[yeah and like I said if you do straight](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m16s)



[selenium you'll get and no such element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m18s)



[exception on the find out man if it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m20s)



[fails so anyway dealing with what we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m23s)



[have the next step then is you'll wait](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m29s)



[until and that's gonna take a funk of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m32s)



[tie](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m35s)



[Oh lovely and it can return so I can I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m36s)



[can just put whatever I want in here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m43s)



[right yep so I can do something like go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m44s)



[and grab my you know this lovely thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m48s)



[right so just return it and then this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m52s)



[goes to here and oh it's an probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h49m57s)



[can't oh it should be able to derive the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m00s)



[generic type can it mmm can it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m03s)



[specifically takes an iWeb driver as an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m06s)



[input ah so you are ready declared but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m08s)



[yeah so it's so I shouldn't use my big](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m12s)



[driver D I should use lowercase little](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m14s)



[driver DS yep which fun fact after we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m17s)



[went through the Oh what did you do to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m19s)



[it oh because it's an iWeb driver and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m24s)



[this thing is a Windows driver mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m26s)



[you jerk the type is different and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m32s)



[apparently the methods available on each](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m34s)



[are different okay so first rule go to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m37s)



[go to full statement so that we can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m43s)



[debug this a little a little more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m45s)



[clearly okay so what exactly do you come](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m47s)



[with oh yeah that's the straight out of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m52s)



[the box selenium driver that's not now I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h50m56s)



[don't doubt that it's passing it through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m02s)



[but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m04s)



[me you gonna have problems mmm-hmm so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m10s)



[okay so hypothetically find element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m16s)



[right and I can do by ID right yeah it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m19s)



[should be always so it's it's yucky and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m24s)



[more importantly I could write an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m26s)



[extension method that wraps this up and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m28s)



[hides it from me oh you have to cast it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m30s)



[too when does a woman you are so I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m36s)



[gonna ask you about that because I've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m44s)



[run into this multiple times is it fair](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m45s)



[inside of a p.m. when WI testing WPF](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m48s)



[elements to assume that I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m52s)



[get web elements and assume that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m54s)



[everything's a windows element because I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m56s)



[ran into that here right so yeah so this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h51m58s)



[get test case right so I find the list](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m06s)



[box that has write the whole list of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m09s)



[things right I then say find element by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m11s)



[test case name so I want to go hunting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m14s)



[by in the list box by that guy but at](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m16s)



[this point I get an app iam web element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m19s)



[not a Windows woman correct yeah I I for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m21s)



[whatever reason so there's two different](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m24s)



[find elements actually there's a fine](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m27s)



[element from your driver which is what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m29s)



[returns the windows open but then you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m31s)



[can do the find element off of another](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m33s)



[element which is what she didn't online](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m35s)



[21 right for whatever reason when app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m37s)



[driver did not I don't know if it's an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m41s)



[extension method I I would love to look](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m46s)



[at their source code but they have an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m48s)



[open source set I'm hoping they do at](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m49s)



[some point but for whatever reason they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m51s)



[find out woman off of another element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m54s)



[does not return to Windows only that is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m56s)



[expected the way that we've gotten](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h52m59s)



[around that can I just up cast yeah you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m03s)



[can shoot clean you up because this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m06s)



[bothered me yep that's what Sean and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m10s)



[did when he first ran into that and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m14s)



[was like oh yeah that's that's expected](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m18s)



[unfortunately](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m21s)



[and so we just started casting it and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m23s)



[it's we haven't run into any situation](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m24s)



[where it's made a difference again I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m26s)



[would love to look at their source code](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m30s)



[to know what you know what they're doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m31s)



[under the covers to find out why they're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m33s)



[not just making that Windows element but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m35s)



[maybe in time so this is effectively the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m39s)



[whole bit of the weight right correct](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m42s)



[okay so well proof is in the pudding let](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m45s)



[me run](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m51s)



[I do technically have code in my base](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m54s)



[test class that's supposed to bring the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m57s)



[window forward however I learned that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h53m58s)



[the windows API for focusing a window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m02s)



[there's like eight caveats on when it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m04s)



[will work and when it will just quietly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m07s)



[fail yeah which is great that they've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m08s)



[clearly documented its failure cases](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m11s)



[mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m13s)



[timed out after one second so this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m15s)



[where it gets weird](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m23s)



[accessibility ID might not line up with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m24s)



[fine by ID yeah and I haven't actually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m28s)



[searched for an element that specific](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m32s)



[way but hold the phone here ie we got an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m36s)



[idea](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h54m42s)

[with the base level items I was very](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m23s)



[much struggling to figure out how to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m26s)



[make these things work XPath I was able](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m28s)



[to make work you know which not overly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m30s)



[shocking right CSS selector never got it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m34s)

[eh doesn't work with WPF that's well](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m42s)



[let's not implement it I should say](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m44s)



[didn't he Oh didn't overly shocked me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m46s)



[that it couldn't find a WPF element with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m48s)



[a CSS selector I was like great I can I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m50s)



[can let that one slide right link text I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h56m52s)

[part that again I was just I would love](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h57m49s)



[to see their source code because I want](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h57m51s)



[to see how they're mapping oh you scrub](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h57m53s)



[away from it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h57m59s)



[oh sorry I was going to the top because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m00s)

[this is actually all the way so this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m05s)



[just straight up and they're reading me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m07s)



[buried deep in the bowels got it mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m08s)



[apparently remembered my thing rather](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m13s)



[than jumping me to the oh no I just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m16s)



[thought no no sorry I never mind I saw I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m20s)



[think it was below I think it was below](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m24s)



[all of these yes there it is okay so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m26s)



[again I would love to just see what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m28s)



[they're doing underneath the cover so I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m29s)



[don't know if they're converting find my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m30s)



[accessibility ID to X path I don't know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m32s)



[I don't know what they're doing there I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m36s)



[would just I would love to know what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m38s)



[their what's happening I always use an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m39s)



[XPath I kind of want to know though oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m44s)



[right so DN by run command so let's just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h58m49s)



[hypothetically say I really really](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m02s)



[really really really want to know what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m04s)



[this method does mm-hmm so we we f12](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m06s)



[that guy it jumps me into something but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m10s)



[what I'm interested in is this guy up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m13s)



[here specifically which is in my nuga](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m15s)



[cache I come over here I go open I go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m18s)



[paste and I go with jaha well that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m22s)



[neat and now we're off to the races](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m26s)



[so let's go have a little peek see and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m29s)



[see let's see what it where is the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m32s)



[there's a navigate to symbol in here as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m35s)



[it just search assemblies](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m39s)



[yeah that's probably what we want and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m42s)



[am specifically interested in find](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m46s)



[element by accessibility ID so fine by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m48s)



[accessibility ID so I think probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m53s)



[here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=00h59m58s)



[okay so it takes so it's calling find](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m03s)



[element it's using this mobile mobile](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m06s)



[accessory called accessibility ID is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m09s)



[this thing oh it's public puzzle p.m.](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m12s)



[and by value so I think I have access to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m15s)



[this right so I usually do exactly this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m25s)



[yeah you should it's in it I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m27s)



[dang positive that's just an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m33s)



[out-of-the-box appium selector what uh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m34s)



[so that's my selector let's see did I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m37s)



[get too many closing friends here I did](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m41s)



[and then you just need to be imported](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m43s)



[find element oh do I not have access to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m49s)



[that overload I don't so I need to go by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m54s)



[and I think one of you has a how do i](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h00m59s)



[how do i convert you does mobile](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m07s)



[selector not inherit from by well this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m13s)



[is just a straight string right so hang](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m18s)



[on let me go back and look at what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m21s)



[because I don't have this overload that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m22s)



[takes because this doesn't exist so let](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m24s)



[me just let me just follow the rabbit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m29s)



[really quick and figure out where this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m30s)



[goes base find element oh hello Houston](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m32s)



[so that is outside of that is outside of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m38s)



[this guy completely by value so it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m44s)



[shelling out remote web element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h01m53s)



[so base types remote web element so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m00s)



[remote web element that should be yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m04s)



[it's not selenium yeah but it's not in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m06s)



[here so I can't chase the rabbit any](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m09s)



[further which is disappointing usually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m12s)



[so DN spy will actually run through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m19s)



[referenced dll's and you'll note that so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m21s)



[I'm noticing just a few things in here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m28s)



[right so did or was I was in here happy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m30s)



[and web element base types so this ruse](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m38s)



[so this is remote web elements so this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m41s)



[guy must be dynamically loaded let me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m46s)



[just see if I've got access to him aha I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m49s)



[do gotcha](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m51s)



[come here sucker you are in a different](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m53s)



[Assembly aren't you that one you know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m56s)



[hello dance bye I need your help again I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h02m59s)



[would like you to open that DLL gracias](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m02s)



[it's almost too easy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m09s)



[okay close to to easy nice oh and that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m11s)



[was specifically inside of most open QA](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m15s)



[selenium remote I'll be QA selenium](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m20s)



[remote remote webdriver is remote](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m24s)



[webdriver not an iWeb so I webdriver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m30s)



[must not have it is the kicker](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m34s)



[alright so find element this guy so a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m36s)



[screen screen so this guy is ultimately](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m41s)



[shelling all the way down to here so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m45s)



[it's interesting okay and then say does](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m50s)



[the buy end up doing the same thing if I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m52s)



[find element this so what is that doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m57s)



[oh that's very very different okay so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h03m59s)



[these are two very different code paths](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m05s)



[Yawk mm-hmm yok I don't think I am](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m09s)



[adequately expressing my distaste for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m16s)



[this okay so Web App driver what exactly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m18s)



[do you have on you URL title don't care](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m26s)



[don't care don't care don't care](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m30s)



[actually expand out I want to look at](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m31s)



[you this way so Yuri so I web driver has](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m34s)



[pretty much nothing directly on it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m39s)



[search context might be more interesting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m42s)



[what do you have on you so you are the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m45s)



[one that has the find elements which is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m48s)



[what we saw the thing being invoked by](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m50s)



[so basically part of my problem is the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m52s)



[moment we get down to webdriver I I lose](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h04m55s)



[all my stuff's you know is there an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m04s)



[alternate interface I could cast this to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m09s)



[to make this work and have it not be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m13s)



[sucky so I suppose on one end okay so we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m16s)



[could cheat right like you say the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m20s)



[simplest would probably just be to use](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m23s)



[your baby driver so I don't disagree](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m26s)



[with you though I'm prepping to make](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m33s)



[this an extension method so I kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m36s)



[want to do it inside and just all right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m38s)



[mmm cast this guy up mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m45s)



[solve and that fixes this casting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m51s)



[problem now too right because now I can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m55s)



[do find element by ID boom](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h05m58s)



[and I can do that mm-hmm okay so what is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m05s)



[your problem now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m10s)



[I usually need to wait what wait until](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m11s)



[Windows element it's like I it's like I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m16s)



[whack too many clothes you still need to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m20s)



[cast the returned to a Windows R woman I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m23s)



[don't think so because this guy is now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m27s)



[going to return a window Solomon yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m30s)



[okay I got to start collapsing this back](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m34s)



[down because I've clearly dropped one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m37s)



[too many](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m38s)



[one too many parens so there's lower D](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m40s)



[upper D closed scroll over just it just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m44s)



[a teeny bit keep it I know this looks](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m50s)



[like a long line but it's not as big as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m52s)



[it looks those clothes can you hover](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m54s)



[over result that tech sparkle right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h06m57s)



[it wants a semicolon am I crazy but last](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m04s)



[I checked this one I was like that one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m08s)



[that's a semicolon unless I'm mistaken](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m10s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m15s)



[I'd like to threaten you hover over one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m16s)



[more time yeah oh line 29 it's it's Oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m17s)

[thank you that's why I need you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m37s)



[okay so there's okay so let's run same](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m41s)



[song third verse I'm very tempted to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m45s)



[also have to set like top most on this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m51s)



[guy because right now I'm relying on the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m53s)



[fact that the tests take a while to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m56s)



[start and I can click on the window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m57s)



[before they get going](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h07m59s)



[yeah because there was one time I didn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m00s)



[get quick enough booyah awesome like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m02s)



[thank you if I mentioned that recently](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m11s)



[well you should just you know what's the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m13s)



[saying you do enough was it you do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m17s)



[enough wrong to know what not to do so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m20s)



[I'm kind of wondering then so so so one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m25s)



[this whole mess I'm thinking is about to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m29s)



[become an extension method right yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m34s)



[because I do not want to do this every](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m35s)



[time that sounds miserable right however](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m38s)



[what I do want to do is ask a couple](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m42s)



[minor questions so I have been throwing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m46s)



[in these tasks delays here and I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m48s)



[that's probably the only way for this to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m53s)



[work](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m56s)



[oh I closed my app down simply because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h08m58s)



[I've got those animations right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m03s)



[would you propose that I not have the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m05s)



[the delays here and instead do more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m13s)



[explicit way](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m17s)



[yes wait for the elements so these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m19s)



[things theoretically run much quicker if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m22s)



[I do that yes and because obviously they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m24s)



[like there is some amount of time that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m29s)



[I'm that I'm doing that I'm simply wait](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m30s)



[like show dialog I know that there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m32s)



[about a third of a second animation time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m35s)



[you know I set it to half as I can just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m38s)



[for buffer yeah and I'm the nice thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m40s)



[with the wait is because it's just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m43s)



[taking in a funk you can pass in that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m45s)



[click and if the click throws it'll just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m48s)



[catch it and retry so then okay so I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m50s)



[think rather than this guy here right so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m53s)



[I don't want so I need to test for the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h09m56s)



[presence of this close button first](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m00s)



[before before I do before I do this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m03s)



[click cuz this click Ike's I mix I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m06s)



[testing the failure case right like I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m08s)



[expecting that the click doesn't go](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m10s)



[through right which is which is great](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m11s)



[right that's kind of what what we're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m14s)



[going for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m16s)



[mm-hmm so I think then what you are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m16s)



[proposing well let's start with this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m20s)



[right so I kind of want to do trying to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m23s)



[decide what to do it on and I think so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m31s)



[let's come down here let's come down](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m33s)



[here here here here what do you normally](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m35s)



[call it for your appium](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m40s)



[trying to think so I I know it's not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m47s)



[kosher usually but right the so the main](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m50s)



[library uses helper as a container for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m55s)



[attached properties I don't think we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m57s)



[actually I normally use mix-ins but I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h10m59s)



[don't think yeah we use helper in most](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m02s)



[of our other cases so we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m09s)



[gonna stick with helper despite that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m12s)



[it's not what I normally use but it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m14s)



[it's what's used elsewhere in the app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m15s)



[and I'm not in a refactoring mood at the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m17s)



[moment so I'm thinking I'm thinking what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m19s)



[I would really like to do is not have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m25s)



[all of this and instead I think what I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m27s)



[want to have is something more akin to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m30s)



[Windows element gets driver mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m33s)



[find element by accessibility ID will](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m40s)



[fix the null ability garbage while I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m44s)



[in there right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m46s)



[and then I want something like time span](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m47s)



[from milliseconds because this should be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m52s)



[this should be quick right so this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m56s)



[should be more like right so I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h11m57s)



[that's the API I want mm-hmm and have it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m03s)



[not suck yeah will this will this until](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m06s)



[ultimately throw an exception if it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m11s)



[times out yeah if so if it if it does](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m14s)



[timeout a little throw webdriver timeout](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m17s)



[exception excellent so we want this and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m19s)



[we want public static what is it web no](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m23s)



[not windows element find element by ID](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m29s)



[string selector right time span timeout](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m35s)



[boom all right so we're just gonna and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m43s)



[we need it to be an extension method on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m46s)



[this and I think we're just gonna pick](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m48s)



[on this guy here right yeah well](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m51s)



[whatever is that is which is the window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m55s)



[yeah windows driver yeah that's right I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h12m59s)



[can never quite remember that the exact](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m01s)



[order about boom so that goes to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m06s)



[driver and everyone never one works so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m09s)



[as much don't everybody hate me all at](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m13s)



[once but I'm gonna do this for the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m15s)



[moment um okay so you're unhappy mostly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m17s)



[because of the return value yeah okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m22s)



[great so add null checks for all](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m24s)



[parameters yeah that sounds good thanks](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m28s)



[okay and I think then what we do is we a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m32s)



[yes a basically just bring in that hunka](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m39s)



[code this this hunk of code and I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m42s)



[what we're going to do unless because I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m46s)



[don't think there's a reason not to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m48s)



[aesthetic read-only I o'clock o'clock](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m50s)



[let's do this clock get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h13m59s)



[system clock so for anyone who cares the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m09s)



[only reason I'm doing the property over](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m13s)



[the field is if I ever need to change](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m14s)



[this later it makes it easier on the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m16s)



[refactor odds of needing to do it very](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m18s)



[low what we're still doing it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m21s)



[let's see webdriver exception requires](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m24s)



[import this guy we know something about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m27s)



[the driver so I'm very comfortable doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m30s)



[this this is in fact my selector you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m32s)



[will handle my null ability you will](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m40s)



[just straight-up return and then timeout](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m43s)



[goes here and then this guy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h14m51s)



[there's a generalized rule here on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m08s)



[retries and I'm trying to remember what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m11s)



[it is the minimum is you do having but I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m13s)



[feel like I want to be a lot more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m16s)



[aggressive than that what did this guy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m17s)



[call it for their fourth parameter sleep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m23s)



[interval mm-hmm so we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m25s)



[gonna get we're gonna get fancy right a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m28s)



[timespan nullable sleep interval](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m31s)



[something more like that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m38s)



[right so if sleep interval it's null](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m40s)



[sleep interval gets actually it will do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m51s)



[this timespan interval its sleep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h15m59s)



[interval time span from milliseconds](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m04s)



[gets timeout total milliseconds divided](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m10s)



[by 10 okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m15s)



[does that seem unreasonable no so shoot](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m21s)



[for 10 retries mm-hmm and if somebody](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m25s)



[doesn't like it we can go through and do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m29s)



[it Hey](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m32s)



[decline my tweet please I have a logic](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m38s)



[gap army that I will show off at some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m42s)



[point tweet canceled is that watches for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m43s)



[new YouTube videos and then sends me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m46s)



[that email to either approve or deny the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m48s)



[tweet notifying everybody of the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m49s)



[YouTube video and I'm guessing that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m51s)



[the video from like the three minutes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m55s)



[where I went oh why is my thing failing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h16m58s)



[and I had to restrain stream nice okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m01s)



[so something more like that so now this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m03s)



[is much cleaner yep and you go away you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m07s)



[know okay so that I like a lot a lot a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m15s)



[lot better so this so this now we can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m19s)



[make a lot nicer as well right so I want](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m22s)



[to actually hunt the presence of the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m25s)



[close button is actually what's going to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m27s)



[trigger this I drank this I do time span](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m29s)



[from seconds 0.5 right because it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m33s)



[shouldn't it should only be a third of a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m39s)



[second I don't want to try any longer](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m41s)



[than that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m42s)



[away we go so and I think a comment the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m43s)



[presence of the close button indicates](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m49s)



[the dialogue is shown ok click click](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h17m54s)



[click close button ok so here's here's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m01s)



[the next question right how would you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m04s)



[test this I want to know when that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m06s)



[gone mmm yeah so that gets that gets](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m12s)



[into a very interesting space where we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m19s)



[kind of have to start really tailoring](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m25s)



[the excellence at weights ok for that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m26s)



[scenario because this was actually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m29s)



[another thing that we talked about I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m32s)



[want to say with two years ago](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m34s)



[you are really testing my memory tonight](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m37s)



[well I'm trying to hook I'm reaching](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m38s)



[back because if the element is still in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m42s)



[air quotes here the Dom because that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m50s)



[ultimately what went after I was doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m53s)



[is it's converting your your WTF to XML](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m55s)



[right visual tree or logical tree it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h18m58s)



[doing something with one of my trees](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m01s)



[right so if if the element is still in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m02s)



[the Dom but hidden then it's gonna](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m06s)



[return false when you check if it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m10s)



[displayed more likely I'm guessing is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m14s)



[it's just not there anymore which means](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m17s)



[your find element will throw so you have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m19s)



[to catch the throw and return false but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m22s)



[you only want to do that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m25s)



[situations where if you know it's not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m26s)



[gonna be there so now we're in this kind](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m29s)



[of weird scenario where the easiest way](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m32s)



[I have found to deal with this and my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m37s)



[co-workers where we're doing I made a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m41s)



[test think I found a deal with this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m43s)



[just have another extension method that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m45s)



[has a condition where where it returns](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m49s)



[if it's not there because in most cases](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m51s)



[we don't want it to return if it's not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m54s)



[there we want it to fail out so that we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m57s)



[can put for a bug so so a couple things](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h19m59s)



[knowing the implementation of this so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m01s)



[this is actually being done inside of a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m04s)



[pop-up which is a lightweight window so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m06s)



[from a WPF perspective these are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m09s)



[separate windows okay they just happen](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m11s)



[to be reasonably positioned and you can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m14s)



[kind I don't know if you can see it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m16s)



[there's a oh don't shake your window](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m17s)



[that's a bad idea because stupid arrow](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m20s)



[shake the so they they're separate](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m23s)



[windows and the unfortunate part is that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m29s)



[part of the animation for this is one of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m32s)



[the first things it does is hide the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m35s)



[dialog and then that overlay fades out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m36s)



[concert so this thing will technically](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m39s)



[disappear before that overlay does okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m42s)



[now so I can there's a couple thoughts](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m48s)



[so one thought is we could go through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m52s)



[and throw because right now there is no](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m56s)



[and and so I don't know I have a hard](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h20m59s)



[time translating this guy's window into](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m02s)



[what I'm seeing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m03s)



[here right but this guy clearly doesn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m04s)



[have what a fully what I would expect](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m07s)



[right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m11s)



[so there's there's some stuff here it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m13s)



[got the this custom thing which okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m15s)



[fine that's probably my user control](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m19s)



[there's all of this stuff I could go in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m21s)



[maybe add accessibility ideas I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m24s)



[know if do things show up in this list](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m26s)



[if you add accessibility IDs to them not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m29s)



[usually so okay either usually either](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m33s)



[can find it or can and whether or not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m37s)



[there's an accessibility ID is just you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m39s)



[know an added nicety so that that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m43s)



[interesting to me because that means](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m46s)



[that my dialog host control is probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m48s)



[m.i.a I guess I guess I don't know right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m51s)



[like this thing says this guy is called](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m55s)



[dialog host overlay so I made because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h21m58s)



[that matches my user control up here I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m00s)



[just kind of assuming that this custom](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m04s)



[is user control mm-hmm it seemed like a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m06s)



[reasonable assumption yeah but the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m08s)



[root level element in here and this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m11s)



[this is one kind of leads into my other](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m14s)



[question right the root level element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m16s)



[inside this user control is a dialog](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m18s)



[host okay so if you added an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m19s)



[accessibility ID to that I would expect](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m24s)



[it to show up it would still I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m28s)



[guessing it was so probably say custom](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m32s)



[but you would then have an an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m33s)



[accessibility I need it to grab so let's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m35s)



[let's test that theory because this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m38s)



[one of the so leading into this the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m41s)



[other thing I wanted to ask about so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m44s)



[dialogue host right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m46s)



[control of five is I wanted to know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m48s)



[about if I wanted to get access to the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m51s)



[WPF properties on these elements is that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m54s)



[reasonably possible so specifically one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m56s)



[of the things that I would love to do is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h22m59s)



[to be able to get ahold of these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m01s)



[elements and test the colors on them](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m02s)



[right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m04s)



[oh yeah I can cheat right okay if the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m05s)



[answer's no that's fine](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m13s)



[I already know how to bit blit and pull](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m15s)



[bitmap](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m17s)



[images and I'm fairly competent with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m18s)



[OpenCV and skia I'm very I'm very](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m20s)



[confident I can do this with image](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m23s)



[manipulation and image analysis I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m25s)



[just really hoping for something where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m28s)



[it was like get attribute because um it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m30s)



[has lets me get at attributes but I but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m33s)



[I don't have a way of knowing right okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m35s)



[so test show dialog all right so where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m38s)



[so this actually mildly concerns me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m44s)



[right like I want to know what the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m46s)



[trigger is for controls being added to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m49s)



[this so the fact that this guy only](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m51s)



[shows up with a little bit is normal so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m54s)



[the a the trigger and I'm gonna make a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h23m57s)



[broad statement here because again I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m00s)



[don't know those specifics I tried to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m02s)



[look into the specifics but there's a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m05s)



[certain part where you have to know the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m06s)



[win32 api which is well beyond me okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m09s)



[the trigger for this is are is is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m15s)



[anything that's an accessibility geared](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m21s)



[property so and when I say accessibility](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m24s)



[I mean in the sense of you know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m30s)



[accessibility for helping people with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m34s)



[impairments use your app okay so I would](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m36s)



[argue color falls into that by the way](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m42s)



[well Windows 10 is adding features for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m44s)



[colorblind people I would argue colors](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m47s)



[and accessibility feature agreed I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m49s)



[gonna show you a little trick here in a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m52s)



[second to get at that a win up driver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m53s)



[currently doesn't well look back to let](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h24m57s)



[me back that up I don't know if it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m00s)



[when I've driver went out driver or the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m02s)



[underlying API doesn't expose color as](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m06s)



[an accessibility property again I try to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m09s)



[look into it but I C++ is a little bit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m13s)



[beyond me so I don't know quite the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m17s)



[specifics but there is so a little bit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m22s)



[of backstory all of these tools are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m26s)



[built on the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m29s)



[uiautomation library which again is just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m32s)



[an interface into the win32 api yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m35s)



[but the UI automation library is kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m39s)



[difficult to use that part I was able to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m44s)



[hack around in and do stuff with but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m46s)



[it's again just it's very geared towards](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m50s)



[hey these are things are gonna help](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m53s)



[people who are you know blind tab](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m55s)



[through your app and get a screen reader](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h25m58s)



[to read your stuff for example now](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m01s)



[having said that I agree I think color](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m06s)



[should be included in that I I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m09s)



[know if we could like feature request](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m13s)



[that or something under github but if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m14s)



[you ever want to see what properties are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m17s)



[available there's kind of a cool trick](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m19s)



[you can do to where if you go back to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m21s)



[your test case and pretty much anywhere](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m23s)



[in the test case doesn't matter where at](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m27s)



[some point where you want to see what's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m30s)



[on screen new app a new variable and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m32s)



[that's equal to or that gets driver dot](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m37s)



[page source I think is what it is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m43s)



[yep and if you drop a breakpoint on 32](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m46s)



[oh is this gonna do what I think it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m53s)



[gonna do you're gonna see what went out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h26m58s)



[driver converted here WPF 2 which is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m00s)



[actually suit well it's it's pretty cool](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m04s)



[to see what it's doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m06s)



[oh that makes me very very excited](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m09s)



[because that cuz it felt like I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m12s)



[getting a little bit of a disjoint yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m14s)



[okay be from this accessibility insights](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m16s)



[into this so okay this is ugly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m19s)



[standby can you view as XML please](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m24s)



[better I'm going to open vs code okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m28s)



[because I just see unfortunately BS code](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m31s)



[saves what you were doing before and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m36s)



[just need to make sure I don't I I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m39s)



[occasionally put things like keys on my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m41s)



[right not a good nah not a good idea I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m45s)



[don't recommend it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m48s)



[oh this thing cropped it you jerks](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m49s)



[hang on oh yes they just go back to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m53s)



[visual studio Envy as XML there it is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h27m56s)



[not the greatest but I want to copy and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m03s)



[not be trimmed thank you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m08s)



[now I can look at you with all the glory](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m11s)



[that is V s code and more importantly I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m14s)



[can zoom you in so that it's visible for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m18s)



[the average layperson okay so this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m21s)



[where it did it oh this this is gold so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m26s)



[your would you say get property there is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m33s)



[a thing that does that in selenium it I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m37s)



[believe it's I think the properties I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m39s)



[have access to are these what when it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m44s)



[saying get attribute it's talking about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m48s)



[these literal XML attributes correct](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m49s)



[that explains why everything I tried](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m54s)



[failed yep so there's certain things](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h28m56s)



[like height width which I there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m00s)



[properties for those anyways that you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m03s)



[can get at but it's it's pretty limited](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m05s)



[unfortunately so cover has come up on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m09s)



[their github a handful of times and the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m13s)



[answer from the maintainer z-- at least](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m17s)



[last time I checked I think about two](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m19s)



[months ago the answer from from the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m22s)



[actual Microsoft folks has been it's not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m25s)



[something that they supported this time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m27s)



[yeah and like I said I'm not overly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m29s)



[concerned because I know I have height](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m32s)



[width x and y which are relative to my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m33s)



[window handle which means I'll just bit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m36s)



[blit it right out that's fine I like I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m38s)



[know where the thing is I don't actually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m41s)



[care about like screenshotting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m43s)



[underneath because I know there's this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m45s)



[screenshot function built in RAM which](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m46s)



[was fine but that looked like it wanted](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m50s)



[to save a file yes if I bit blit it I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m52s)



[can just grab the Rob bits](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m55s)



[mmm-hmm done the screen shot hmm I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h29m57s)



[it returns a bitmap so he technically](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m04s)



[don't have to save it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m07s)



[yeah but I thought it was like a system](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m08s)



[drawing bitmap which meant referencing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m10s)



[the wind forms library and it that made](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m13s)



[me feel dirty inside ah fair enough](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m16s)



[but height height with X&Y you can get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m19s)



[at there's there's both in properties](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m22s)



[you don't have to do the get attribute](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m25s)



[yeah right those yeah those ones I came](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m26s)



[across and found yeah okay so this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m29s)



[this is really helpful thank you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m31s)



[this is gold okay so my my problem](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m34s)



[though that I have and I suspect this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m38s)



[going to happen is I added this dialogue](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m41s)



[host and put in an automation ID on it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m44s)



[and as far as I can tell](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m47s)



[so there's four instances this is class](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m51s)



[name which I'm pretty sure is not it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m55s)



[that also appears to be something with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h30m57s)



[the class name that would yes that would](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m01s)



[go along with the list item hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m05s)



[oh that explains why I couldn't find the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m08s)



[thing by name oh I was trying to hunt it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m10s)



[by name and I couldn't figure out and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m12s)



[that looks like the fully qualify type](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m14s)



[name okay Danny did not know that so I I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m15s)



[hunted this out I've pulled the text](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m19s)



[element out of it instead](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m21s)



[doncha which was fine right like and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m22s)



[then this guy here so this because this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m25s)



[is the thing that I want to to try and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m29s)



[see if I can figure out how to do is I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m31s)



[would like if people want to UI test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m34s)



[their app and they've got a material](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m37s)



[design control in it right how do I make](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m39s)



[this thing can you here in here can you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m41s)



[do me kind of just off-the-wall total](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m46s)



[gas can you see if you can add an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m50s)



[automation ID property that line 10](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m52s)



[right here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m55s)



[mm-hm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h31m57s)



[so not here because this is an object](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m00s)



[property on the dialogue host I can put](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m03s)



[it here on this okay so yeah maybe there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m07s)



[on the thing inside right like because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m09s)



[the dialogue host itself is a is a WPF](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m12s)



[content control and we actually have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m17s)



[several controls like this right that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m18s)



[that they are custom controls they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m20s)



[derive from one of the built-in WPF](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m23s)



[controls right and I guess to be fair I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m25s)



[kind of know the answer a little bit I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m29s)



[wouldn't show up because I don't I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m33s)



[all the WPF controls inherit whatever](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m37s)



[the accessibility hang on I think I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m39s)



[remember seeing something I was digging](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m43s)



[through the user control source code the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m44s)



[other day UI automation here haha I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m46s)



[vaguely remember something about this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m56s)



[you have to built an automation peer](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h32m58s)



[class this did here drop the custom the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m04s)



[so if the custom control derives from](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m12s)



[something that doesn't have a built-in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m14s)



[automation peer class so you'll note](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m18s)



[there ones that they call out our button](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m20s)



[text block label etc examples of class](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m22s)



[that do not have them are things like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m26s)



[borders grids canvas etc decorators](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m28s)



[recent oh well welcome back to that I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m33s)



[think we may so I had a bug about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m38s)



[decorators I know I've talked about on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m40s)



[this stream recently but there is yes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m42s)



[this this is okay so in order to make it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m48s)



[visible I probably need to do this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m51s)



[mmm-hmm for your custom control set it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m53s)



[returns your provider object okay so in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h33m59s)



[this case](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m03s)



[I'm trying to decide how to handle this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m06s)



[right because there is nothing currently](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m09s)



[right I mean I'm in full control of this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m12s)



[code right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m14s)



[because again ideally what I would love](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m15s)



[for this test to do is not have this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m17s)



[right and instead oh man I kind of want](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m20s)



[to use this to write my own little](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m23s)



[custom helper thing now you have you've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m25s)



[ruined me sorry or you're welcome well](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m27s)



[yeah I kind of want to have a little WPF](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m31s)



[app that reads this XML in and displays](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m33s)



[it in a tree which I'm guessing is kinda](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m35s)



[what this guy is trying to do right but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m37s)



[this is yeah yeah they're older tool I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m40s)



[don't know I they're older - older cool](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m45s)



[had some big advantages over that one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m49s)



[but yes because ultimately what I was so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m51s)



[here and I'll show you so real quick](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m55s)



[here's house so the dialog host itself](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m57s)



[has an is open property right open-close](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h34m59s)



[open-close it's not rocket science but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m02s)



[the the key thing here is when the open](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m04s)



[property goes to false right that's the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m09s)



[that's the key trigger this thing is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m12s)



[going to come change state so the visual](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m14s)



[state manager triggers it fire and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m17s)



[unless you've disabled transitions this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m20s)



[thing goes and starts trade execute to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m22s)



[the transition which takes about a third](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m25s)



[of a second and that looks like doo doo](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m26s)



[doo doo doo clicking clicking was not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m30s)



[prepared to small datagrid go away so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m40s)



[this guy here make sure I grab the right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m47s)



[one oh this is datagrid nut dialogue](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m49s)



[host that will not help open the right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m52s)



[one so there are two dialogue hosts but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h35m56s)



[we'll use the one that matters this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m01s)



[the one that we were testing and so it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m02s)



[triggers and goes from open to closed](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m05s)



[right so this storyboard kicks off](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m08s)



[running and you'll note it has a whole](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m10s)



[bunch of stuff so for example things](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m14s)



[like watching](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m16s)



[the the pop-up so it'll toggle the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m18s)



[the state of the pop-up to false add a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m21s)



[third of a second right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m25s)



[it'll animate this content covers that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m28s)



[gray overlay fading out so you'll note](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m30s)



[it'll animate the opacity of that thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m33s)



[fading out and there's a trigger that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m36s)



[says when that thing gets to why is this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m38s)



[going the other direction value at zero](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m44s)



[oh okay so it is it's going from point](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m50s)



[56 down to zero over the course of a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m52s)



[third of a second okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m54s)



[I just read that backwards before and so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h36m56s)



[when it gets down to zero it'll](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m00s)



[ultimately go through and set the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m02s)



[visibility off and I'm wondering I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m05s)



[wondering if it makes sense to have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m10s)



[something on that high so I think maybe](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m11s)



[what I need to do is spend a little time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m16s)



[looking at that automation pier I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m17s)



[this is probably so in the interest of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m21s)



[simplicity mmm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m25s)



[what would you propose for this for this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m28s)



[test here where I want like because I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m31s)



[could test for the presence of the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m34s)



[element being gone but again it will](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m36s)



[disappear and let me confirm that I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m38s)



[fairly confident](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m41s)



[I guess the pop-up actually stays open](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m43s)



[until a third of a second mm-hmm so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m46s)



[maybe I can't test for the absence of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m49s)



[the element as so as long as it remains](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m50s)



[in that page source that we looked at](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m55s)



[just a second ago as long as it remains](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h37m58s)



[there you can totally test for the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m01s)



[element to be not visible okay if the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m03s)



[challenge is at least in a lot of the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m09s)



[apps we deal with the element just gets](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m12s)



[removed when it's invisible so that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m14s)



[where we have to do some weird try](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m16s)



[catches return false the other probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m18s)



[the easiest way to guarantee that it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m23s)



[gonna work is to wrap the test overlay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m26s)



[button not click on line four](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m29s)



[seven in a webdriver wait and then if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m31s)



[it's clickable then well I should back](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m36s)



[that because that depends on a fee](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m41s)



[element actually yes so here's the thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m43s)



[if these buttons are always available](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m45s)



[and able to be clicked okay so that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m48s)



[that's the problem is I can't test me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m50s)



[yeah I can't test for this element](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m52s)



[because that's actually like I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m54s)



[legitimately trying to click on it while](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m55s)



[the dialogue is shown okay right because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h38m57s)



[I attempt to click on the button here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m00s)



[and then assert that might clicks tin](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m02s)



[increment god yeah so so you ultimate](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m04s)



[like I'm legitimately trying to click on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m09s)



[it so that passes because it's part of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m11s)



[the visual tree so you could get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m13s)



[actually kind of hey you can get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m17s)



[interesting and wrap both lines 46 and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m19s)



[47 in a webdriver way and that way if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m23s)



[the dialogue hello present if the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m28s)



[dialogue is present that clicks on line](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m33s)



[47 shouldn't increment and we'll throw](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m36s)



[an equal exception or assert equal](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m38s)



[exception when the two you soon use a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m42s)



[webdriver wait to catch the equal](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m46s)



[exception and retry from ah I love it I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m48s)



[love it see this is this is why I asked](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m52s)



[you to help me because you that is I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m54s)



[like that that is that is brilliant like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m56s)



[part of me feels dirty every time I have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h39m59s)



[to do something like that but at the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m01s)



[same time it's like well when you're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m03s)



[testing third party apps but you don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m05s)



[have control over the code right there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m07s)



[so like like I had the same type of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m10s)



[thing when we were doing tests with like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m13s)



[like actual hardware there's sometimes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m18s)



[where legitimate sleeps are allowed](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m20s)



[mm-hmm when there are physical things](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m23s)



[that you must wait on me you've got no](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m25s)



[outside trigger to trigger on it's like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m28s)



[I it's gonna take about a second that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m30s)



[wait we're gonna just to be safe Hey](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m33s)



[especially if I'm sitting on the thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m35s)



[while it's going up and down so not that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m37s)



[I've ever ridden on software I've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m41s)



[written](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m43s)



[that was a fun day uh world's most](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m44s)



[expensive footstool okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m50s)



[sorry for everyone who doesn't get the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m53s)



[reference project at work okay so we're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m55s)



[gonna do a driver and I think we will do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h40m59s)



[a time span from seconds like this this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m05s)



[shouldn't go more than that right hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m10s)



[time span from milliseconds and in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m13s)



[reality cuz it's gonna do this right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m17s)



[away isn't it mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m20s)



[yeah no check right away and then wait](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m24s)



[for a vulnerable we'll do 200 like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m26s)



[that'll be too fast the first one should](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m29s)



[fail actually in the interest of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m30s)



[confirming that this works the way we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m33s)



[want let's make it fail right so inside](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m34s)



[of here what we're saying we're going to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m40s)



[do then is we don't actually care about](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m43s)



[any of that in fact we don't even need](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m46s)



[the driver at all for this because we're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m49s)



[just going to move both of you guys](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m52s)



[inside yeah we're not gonna have a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m54s)



[return so we're just gonna throw that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m57s)



[away yeah well don't you worry don't you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h41m59s)



[worry oh right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m05s)



[return zero looks great to me my my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m06s)



[default is always more turn through boom](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m11s)



[you are this in route so 948 is going to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m16s)



[be equal exception I believe that is the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m20s)



[X unit one okay so because we don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m26s)



[expect any of the other ones to throw we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m30s)



[know that I can click this even with the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m32s)



[other things shown I'm gonna hide that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m34s)



[for the moment let's see yeah just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m36s)



[trying to figure out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m41s)



[how to do that so that goes there what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m42s)



[is your problem now oh hey look at that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m48s)



[no longer a sink no longer needs to be a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m52s)



[sink so that'll be cool because the only](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h42m55s)



[reason it was a sink was because of that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m00s)



[so I think I will probably go through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m01s)



[and my main window guy where it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m03s)



[looking stuff up I will probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m05s)



[leverage our new method and might give](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m06s)



[myself a couple overloads for it mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m09s)



[because this is just handy a minute then](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m11s)



[it makes it nice to write like I can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m17s)



[fall back on the the built-in ones if I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m20s)



[want right that's a lot of airs what is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m24s)



[going on so okay so the air is actually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m32s)



[this so it turns out you can't compile](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m37s)



[while you have the app running oh right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m40s)



[that was a lot of airs to tell me that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m43s)



[the app was already running right so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m45s)



[specifically so I need to do some tests](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m48s)



[I think there's still some they've been](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m50s)



[fixing a lot of zamel designer bugs so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m52s)



[for anyone watching be aware if you've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m54s)



[got a problem with visual studio help](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h43m57s)



[and then where is it send feedback they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m00s)



[legitimately watch these and will](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m04s)



[process it so write a good bug report](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m06s)



[and they will fix it so there was an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m09s)



[issue with 20 19 16 for something like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m12s)



[that reported the zamel bug they just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m17s)



[reported back earlier this week that it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m20s)



[is in the latest preview and asked me to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m22s)



[retest most which I've still not gotten](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m24s)



[around to but to their credit they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m27s)



[communicated that they fixed the bug](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m30s)



[they were able to easily identify it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m32s)



[to be fair I gave them the live stream](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m34s)



[link and my repo I was like I can't make](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m37s)



[this much easier nice so run I suppose I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m41s)



[technically didn't need to do that but I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m46s)



[kind of want to see this go so last time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m48s)



[I think it took like 3.1 seconds with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m50s)



[all of my timeouts and I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m52s)



[curious as to how much we can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m54s)



[this down oh yeah buddy](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h44m56s)



[oh yeah very nice two point three](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m00s)



[seconds as fast as humanly possible](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m04s)



[I approve especially since you were like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m06s)



[you were saying that these sleeps add up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m09s)



[a lot over time mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m12s)



[a lot and I'm kind of thinking now that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m15s)



[did I did I turn off that implicit no](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m19s)



[and I kind of want to kill it now mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m23s)



[because I don't think I want the time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m26s)



[out at all right I want it to I think I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m28s)



[want my default behavior to be fail](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m31s)



[immediately right yeah because I mean](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m33s)



[it's def by a thousand paper that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m36s)



[right like if you're waiting on every](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m38s)



[single little thing when you don't need](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m41s)



[to sure quarter second here quarter](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m43s)



[cycle there isn't a big deal but again](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m47s)



[you know when you're running a hundred](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m49s)



[or 500 or a thousand tests and they're](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m50s)



[all waiting that long that's when you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m53s)



[run into situations where your test run](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m55s)



[takes you know many many hours which is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h45m57s)



[just exhausting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m01s)



[yeah I can understand that okay and you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m03s)



[answered my other question about the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m07s)



[colors because I think that so I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m10s)



[think I'm gonna hold up my PR to get the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m13s)



[color stuff in but I think I need I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m16s)



[think I need to finish out these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m18s)



[extension methods mm-hmm because I and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m20s)



[update these guys to leverage them](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m23s)



[mm-hmm I think that'll be critical and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m26s)



[assume this will run just fine in my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m31s)



[pipeline now probably you might want to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m32s)



[rerun it just to make sure that the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m35s)



[implicit wait wasn't catching something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m37s)



[we weren't already catching with an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m38s)



[explicit wait but that's a fair point so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m40s)



[and actually so real quick well while](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m46s)



[we're talking here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m50s)



[sorry and I must have missed something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m54s)



[wrong thing posted I'm guessing there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h46m56s)



[I'm guessing I'm gonna see a comment on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m02s)



[something else at some point but I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m03s)



[actually see anything else for me and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m05s)



[okay so and the one thing I think I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m07s)



[going to do is I think I'm gonna move](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m10s)



[this inside of here right so this only](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m13s)



[runs in a debug build because I'm sort](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m17s)



[of using debug and release to dictate](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m20s)



[the difference between local and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m22s)



[pipeline mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m24s)



[right it means I can switch to release](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m26s)



[up here and get the behavior of my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m28s)



[pipeline locally which is convenient but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m31s)



[I think what I want to do is this pound](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m34s)



[if debug right I'm gonna I'm gonna use](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m40s)



[my own window that I started found else](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m45s)



[let this guy run and though you did warn](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m50s)



[me that this may have problems if the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m55s)



[app doesn't start fast enough mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h47m58s)



[which I do somewhat worried I think I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m01s)



[would probably go to address it if that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m06s)



[started happening but for example the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m07s)



[main window view model is using](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m10s)



[reflection to iterate over itself and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m12s)



[populate these test cases so I can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m13s)



[easily see if this list starts getting](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m17s)



[long mm-hmm that the startup time will](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m19s)



[suffer so but if that is the case I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m22s)



[think what I do is I push this off and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m24s)



[like I think it failing is a good thing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m27s)



[because I think it indicates that I've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m31s)



[done something wrong in my app and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m32s)



[probably need to address it yeah demo](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m33s)



[app it may be problematic with only](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m35s)



[because the demo app loads up like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m39s)



[everything in the library gotcha](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m42s)



[but we'll see if it's not a problem I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m46s)



[gonna leave um I think I would rather](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m48s)



[leave it and let the win after I ever do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m49s)



[its thing mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m50s)



[cuz I'm I'm gonna make the assumption](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m52s)



[that the people who work on it are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m55s)



[smarter than me actually let's let's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h48m56s)



[confirm that real quick because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m01s)



[if I hit run and I think this one works](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m04s)



[because and we'll load on the to the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m07s)



[right screen mm-hmm because and the time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m08s)



[out is something like 60 seconds or 120](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m12s)



[seconds it's it's extremely generous and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m15s)



[you might be able to override it I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m17s)



[haven't looked into overriding it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m23s)



[because the last application that took](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m25s)



[that long to load popped up a window the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m28s)



[window came down and new window popped](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m32s)



[up so launching it through one after](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m34s)



[iver didn't work anyway because there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m36s)



[was a very weird that looks like because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m37s)



[it had a splash screen type loading deal](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m40s)



[or something yeah I could understand](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m42s)



[that that would that would make sense](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m45s)



[because I imagine what it does is it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m46s)



[pops the process and probably wait to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m48s)



[see a window handle you know which](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m50s)



[approach protip for anybody who is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m53s)



[unaware you cannot read if you grab a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h49m56s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m01s)



[if you cannot like this this thing is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m01s)



[using delays and I'm kind of curious to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m05s)



[see what kind of performance changes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m07s)



[happen but if you have a process object](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m08s)



[that you start and you're looking for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m10s)



[the main window handle you cannot get it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m12s)



[you need to create a new process](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m15s)



[instance there is a bug that has since](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m18s)



[been fixed](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m20s)



[Oh ctrl-c ctrl-v to the wrong chat got](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m22s)



[it all good okay so real quick so I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m27s)



[noticing this that run took 1.1 minutes](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m33s)



[mmm that is miserable mm-hmm you have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m37s)



[now inspired me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m43s)



[because this sucks No](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m47s)



[right yeah the so but let me so let me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m51s)



[ask the question though because this is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m55s)



[probably good because I don't and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m57s)



[think some of this is my own ignorance](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h50m59s)



[of not and and I'm probably gonna have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m00s)



[more of these I'll warn you of where I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m03s)



[start writing these tests and then I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m06s)



[have to say Mike save me how would you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m07s)



[do this was like your weight trick is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m09s)



[clever so once again I've got a custom](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m11s)



[material design control in this case](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m14s)



[it's called a drawer host so it can have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m16s)



[up to four drawers on either side in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m19s)



[this case it's only got the left one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m20s)



[right but more importantly you click the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m22s)



[button there's that gray overlay again](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m24s)



[and this thing slides out mm-hmm so the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m26s)



[problem being that those elements are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m30s)



[there it may be hard to see but those](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m34s)



[elements actually fade in as the drawer](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m37s)



[is sliding out okay so there there is a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m39s)



[fade I imagine they probably show up and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m42s)



[they probably show up as invisible all](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m46s)



[the time in the Dom I don't know that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m50s)



[for a fact I haven't tested it but I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m52s)



[imagine that they're probably always](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m53s)



[there so given that how would you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h51m55s)



[propose writing the test where this just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m01s)



[clicks we don't need to do this now I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m03s)



[realize I usually quit about 11:00 and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m04s)



[I'm coming up on the ten minute mark](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m07s)



[there but so I I usually like to go with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m08s)



[do the simplest thing first that doesn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m17s)



[work](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m20s)



[add one thing if that doesn't work out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m21s)



[another so I would go with just a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m23s)



[webdriver wait wrapping either the the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m25s)



[find element or like a find element and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m29s)



[the dot displayed or probably not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m32s)



[enabled one of the two and then if that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m34s)



[doesn't work then wrap the click and if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m40s)



[that doesn't work then wrap something](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m42s)



[like the click in the expected response](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m46s)



[kind of like what we did earlier where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m47s)



[you know we did the click and then the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m49s)



[assert yeah there's been there's a so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m51s)



[the idea being effectively if this list](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m55s)



[items click is throwing we do that with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h52m57s)



[an explicit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m00s)



[wait is what we're proposing yep okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m01s)



[yep](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m05s)



[it's so it's kind of interesting because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m06s)



[because of selenium approach of either](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m12s)



[you know either](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m16s)



[I'm gonna give you a you a sport or](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m17s)



[throw ya you know there's no event](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m19s)



[handling there's no plagues](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m21s)



[you know nothing we can kind of cool off](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m24s)



[of very out of the box outside of using](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m26s)



[webdriver wait uh-huh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m30s)



[you start getting SuperDuper explicit](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m32s)



[and super duper like step by step in in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m35s)



[the test so in this case you know like I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m40s)



[was saying I would start off with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m43s)



[wrapping the click in webdriver wait if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m45s)



[for whatever reason that isn't good](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m51s)



[enough then it's you know or or the fine](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m52s)



[probably actually them to click then you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m56s)



[know click make sure that whatever we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h53m59s)



[navigated to maybe that amber primary](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m02s)



[color button is there about what that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m05s)



[was gonna be my question right cuz right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m08s)



[now I'm not testing anything on these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m10s)



[pages I'm literally just clicking](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m12s)



[through them and making sure that they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m14s)



[load without blowing the app up like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m16s)



[it's a very rudimentary level check](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m19s)



[there's only been a handful of bugs that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m21s)



[have managed to get through and actually](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m23s)



[don't even get past pull request](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m25s)



[verification with with those without](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m27s)



[those getting caught because most bugs](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m29s)



[that look like they might be mildly](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m31s)



[risky](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m32s)



[I fire the app up and run it so it's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m33s)



[really say the the only time that's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m36s)



[happened is you know something that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m37s)



[looks fairly benign on like some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m39s)



[resource and it's like oh yeah I didn't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m41s)



[realize that was gonna now break the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m44s)



[demo app that's usually what happens so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m45s)



[that's that's the only reason for this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m49s)



[clicking through so I agree that the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m51s)



[list item click should be in a wait so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m53s)



[that it waits the minimum amount of time](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m55s)



[that eliminates this delay right so if I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h54m57s)



[if I put the explicit wait here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m00s)



[the only thing I don't know about though](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m03s)



[is testing to know when it's ok to come](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m05s)



[back and click this button does does the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m08s)



[visibility change if something's covered](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m11s)



[up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m13s)



[it depends oh that that doesn't make me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m14s)



[feel warm and fuzzy in most cases I've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m19s)



[seen yes that will either be hidden be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m22s)



[disabled or be removed from the dawn I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m27s)



[have seen one or two weird cases where](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m29s)



[where overlays the the stuff underneath](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m32s)



[still acts like it's present still acts](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m37s)



[like it's enabled I super duper weird in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m40s)



[that specific case I'm pretty sure they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m46s)



[wrote their own custom I think I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m49s)



[it was a win for map actually but I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m52s)



[believe they wrote their own custom](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m55s)



[controls so in this case I would expect](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h55m56s)



[that little hamburger icon either to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m00s)



[hidden disabled or not present so you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m04s)



[could test for that well when I say test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m07s)



[oh and I believe when you're saying that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m11s)



[some main window hamburger toggle button](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m13s)



[so there is so the displayed flag I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m17s)



[think is what you're referring to right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m19s)



[dissuade or enabled I would expect one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m21s)



[of those Christine yeah I would expect](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m25s)



[one of those to appropriately or it just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m28s)



[not be there fact that's another option](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m31s)



[okay I I would be a little shocked if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m33s)



[that were the case because just from](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m36s)



[knowing how the drawer host is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m38s)



[implemented because it's not going out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m39s)



[of the visual tree and functionally](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m41s)



[we're literally just sliding a panel on](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m43s)



[top of it so from a WPF perspective it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m45s)



[hasn't it's still in the visual tree](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m48s)



[it's still occupying space and rendering](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m50s)



[and all of that it's just we've slid a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m52s)



[panel on top of it okay so yeah hidden](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m54s)



[or sorry displayed or enabled got it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h56m57s)



[gets the value with JavaScript property](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m02s)



[of this yeah that's a dream](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m04s)



[yeah there's get screenshot and take](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m14s)



[screenshot there's two different so okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m16s)



[so hold on let me](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m20s)



[what does oh hello so this they have we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m22s)



[have abstracted it away why did I feel](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m27s)



[like I saw an API that was going to wind](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m30s)



[forms there it might be the one on the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m32s)



[driver because there's there's a I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m36s)



[it's take screenshot on the driver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m38s)



[there's get screenshot on the element so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m40s)



[you Michael this will be a screenshot of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m44s)



[just my hamburger button right I imagine](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m47s)



[it uses those coordinate bounce to zero](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m49s)



[in on it I believe so yes that's pretty](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m52s)



[cool right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m58s)



[that's really cool I'm gonna I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h57m59s)



[have to look at that because I think](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m04s)



[ultimately there there's a significant](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m05s)



[number of bugs in the library that come](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m08s)



[up because something is the wrong color](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m10s)



[or I can't configure color X in](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m12s)



[condition Y right like it's a theming](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m15s)



[library that is the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m18s)



[what comes through for example there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m20s)



[an existing bug right now because we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m23s)



[have let's see here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m26s)



[so when you when you have this hint](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m30s)



[right you can see password it floats up](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m33s)



[as part of the line mm-hmm and so right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m35s)



[now what's happening is when when you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m37s)



[have a floating hint its setting the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m40s)



[background explicitly to be one of the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m42s)



[theme brushes the background paper which](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m44s)



[is fine right up until your background](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m47s)



[doesn't match the theme brush because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m49s)



[when you see if you know like a gray](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m52s)



[background and this white thing around](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m54s)



[the hint it's and it's hard-coded so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h58m57s)



[there's a bit of an issue they're not](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m00s)



[gonna lie and I introduced the bug so if](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m03s)



[anybody wants to throw tomatoes okay so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m06s)



[but it's one of those I wanted I was I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m10s)



[as soon as I saw the bug come up I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m13s)



[like you know that feels like a great UI](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m15s)



[test right like I want a valve because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m19s)



[ultimately it shouldn't be setting the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m22s)



[background here but I think it should be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m24s)



[setting the background here](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m26s)



[right because if it doesn't set a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m28s)



[background you end up seeing that line](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m29s)



[cut right through the word password](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m31s)



[which right it's worthless right and so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m33s)



[it would be really nice to grab this oh](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m37s)



[that may be another problem with the get](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m40s)



[screenshot it uses the element bounds](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m42s)



[and we have controls that go outside](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m45s)



[their bounds that could bite us right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m47s)



[for things like this but it may not be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m53s)



[that big of a deal right like the for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m57s)



[example this color zone up above if you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=01h59m59s)



[do drop shadows typically the drop](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m02s)



[shadows expand outside of the elements](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m04s)



[bounds right well I mean it at that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m06s)



[point you could use when app driver to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m09s)



[get the bounds and then just paddock and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m11s)



[yeah you could you would have to know](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m13s)



[something about the elements properties](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m15s)



[so for example the shadows eggs the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m17s)



[thing right like to know how much to Pat](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m20s)



[it I would have to make some assumptions](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m23s)



[about which which depth of shadow we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m25s)



[were talking about yeah so there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m28s)



[there's that right but because there's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m31s)



[there's a bunch of fancy stuff with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m35s)



[shadows that you can do to to clip them](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m37s)



[and do it because sometimes you only](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m39s)



[want the shadow on one edge right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m42s)



[and by default WPF is going to do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m45s)



[shadows on all because you can kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m47s)



[see the shadow there are the direction](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m49s)



[in our library is always 270 so you can](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m52s)



[you can kind of see the diagonal on it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m55s)



[but sometimes you just want to clip it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m57s)



[mm-hmm so there's that for anyone](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h00m59s)



[interested these attach properties this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m03s)



[is just a drop shadow effect in WPF with](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m07s)



[some pre-canned values if you don't like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m10s)



[the pre-canned values add your own drop](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m12s)



[shadow effect it's one line is Amal so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m14s)



[I've resisted the urge of people asking](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m18s)



[for a lot of functionality to these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m20s)



[because ultimately the shadows are there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m22s)



[to support a very small set of use cases](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m26s)



[and adding your own drop shadow effect](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m28s)



[is pretty straightforward so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m30s)



[cool well I think I'm at 11:11 Mike and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m34s)



[I don't want to keep you too late so any](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m37s)



[other bits of wisdom or awesomeness you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m41s)



[want to drop on me to make me feel like](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m43s)



[uh to give me a false sense of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m46s)



[confidence like I know what I'm doing](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m49s)



[well I mean you've done great so far](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m51s)



[and I don't know if it's wisdom again I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m55s)



[think it's just the whole kind enough to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m57s)



[know not what not to do but yeah I just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h01m59s)



[make what were we use of webdriver](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m03s)



[weights that's the main thing cool sweet](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m04s)



[I am going to get these changes checked](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m11s)



[into my branch I'm probably gonna add](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m13s)



[the overloads just so that I can see](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m16s)



[them working and get those going and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m18s)



[then verify that that things are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m20s)



[actually flowing oh one last thing I'm](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m23s)



[going to ask you is there do you have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m25s)



[any bits of wisdom on what the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m28s)



[appropriate is say you want to do some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m30s)



[sort of debug outputting stuff right I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m34s)



[noticed that the two string on these](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m36s)



[objects is I won't say a hundred percent](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m38s)



[worthless but it's pretty close to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m41s)



[worthless because it gives you the if we](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m44s)



[look at this the the runtime ID which](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m48s)



[yes I'm sure these means something right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m51s)



[but as an output right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m54s)



[is there anything like is there anything](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h02m58s)



[reasonable so if I don't know anything](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m03s)



[about my elements like I haven't gone](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m04s)



[through and set up something on them is](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m06s)



[there a reasonable property I can look](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m08s)



[at to get a reason a reasonable to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m10s)



[string on them usually the name okay](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m12s)



[usually it's not named class name god](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m17s)



[it's a name or class name is problem and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m21s)



[I think in this case class name is more](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m23s)



[likely to be or a tag name maybe take](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m25s)



[well tag names gonna be really generic](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m30s)



[that's gonna be like button that's one](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m31s)



[that's better than the stupid numbers](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m35s)



[I I would say start with probably name](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m38s)



[unless you can guarantee there's an](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m41s)



[automation ID on everything](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m43s)



[well and this because this is the demo](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m45s)



[app there's not and I was trying to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m47s)



[resist the urge to go through and put](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m48s)



[automation IDs on every single page](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m50s)



[gotcha ultimately that it probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m52s)



[should right but my goal is not to have](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m54s)



[the the demo app be the automation](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h03m58s)



[example right like well I shouldn't say](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m01s)



[that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m05s)



[I want the demo app to demo how to do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m05s)



[automation with the controls right so I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m08s)



[want to be able to like drive into my](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m10s)



[dialogues page and say look if you are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m12s)



[doing UI testing you've got a dialog](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m14s)



[host here's you know here's what's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m16s)



[available to you right but I don't](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m18s)



[expect to exact the breadth of what's](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m22s)



[possible that's what this joints for](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m24s)



[because ultimately I'm stealing this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m26s)



[idea from the xamarin forms team they've](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m28s)



[got an app in their repo that when it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m30s)



[fires up it basically generates a list](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m33s)



[of a whole bunch of test cases oh and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m35s)



[it's literally like I think a lot of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m37s)



[them have bug and ID right okay somebody](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m40s)



[reported bug X here's a test that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m43s)



[verifies that it's fixed and it's just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m45s)



[grown over the years okay so I kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m49s)



[figured well it's that seems to be](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m52s)



[working out well for them all the best](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m55s)



[ideas come from knowing who to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m57s)



[plagiarize from let's let's go through](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h04m58s)



[and spin something and and see how it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m02s)



[comes out so cuz my goal is like I try](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m04s)



[to make this library easy for people to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m07s)



[contribute to them and so I I'm still](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m09s)



[debating about whether these projects](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m12s)



[get included specifically the UI test](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m15s)



[one whether this gets included as part](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m17s)



[of the main solution or maybe if I add a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m19s)



[solution filter or something to sure](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m21s)



[that not everyone needs it because I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m23s)



[want everyone to be able to contribute](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m25s)



[and expecting people to have to install](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m26s)



[like win app driver just to be able to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m28s)



[build the solution when most people](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m30s)



[probably don't care about the UI tests](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m31s)



[right real quick you don't need that Fla](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m33s)



[UI reference okay I just saw that both](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m35s)



[of them correct yeah you can whack you](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m43s)



[over them](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m45s)



[sweet that's a it's kind of a](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m46s)



[competitive competitor ished win app](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m47s)



[driver ah long this is why I was I was](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m52s)



[plagiarizing someone else](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m56s)



[and wasn't sure what I needed so I just](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m57s)



[blindly took in all their references](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h05m59s)



[right I didn't know it I should probably](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m01s)



[go clean that project up now right yeah](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m03s)



[long story short Microsoft used to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m06s)



[support a technology called Kona UI](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m10s)



[which again these are all based off of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m12s)



[that UI automation library I mentioned](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m15s)



[earlier so Microsoft ISA support code UI](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m17s)



[Cody UI was interesting how will word](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m20s)



[that one it it did what it needed to do](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m25s)



[but it was kind of a kind of a pain to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m30s)



[work with so the I don't know her name](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m32s)



[but they they came out test a quite they](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m38s)



[came out with this application or this](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m40s)



[test utility called test that way from](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m42s)



[what I understand from their comments](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m46s)



[that was kind of their first stab at it](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m48s)



[it became a little unmaintainable so](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m49s)



[then they came out with F Lau I kind of](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m52s)



[shortly before went up driver came out](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m56s)



[so Fla why is that it's it's a very user](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h06m57s)



[friendly tool but you know unfortunately](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m02s)



[there is kind of in the it's not as well](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m06s)



[supported as when after ever from what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m08s)



[I've seen I could be wrong on that but](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m10s)



[when I'm dressed it's still pretty](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m13s)



[active cool yeah at least from what I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m15s)



[saw poking around it looked like there](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m18s)



[was a lot of information but it also](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m20s)



[felt like you kind of have to sift](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m21s)



[through the weeds of selenium Docs and](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m23s)



[Devine how does that translate into what](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m26s)



[I'm doing because yes it seems like the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m28s)



[number of people doing WPF UI tests are](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m32s)



[are limited so one example I found that](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m34s)



[was that has been hugely helpful and I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m37s)



[should go find the link for it and pull](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m39s)



[it in is the the Microsoft calculator](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m41s)



[sample yes because they when they open](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m44s)



[sourced it like they will open sourced](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m48s)



[and said here's how we're doing all the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m50s)



[things you know we're how we test our](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m52s)



[calculator to make sure it works right](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m54s)



[which is funny you mention that because](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m56s)



[if that's the same when I've looked at I](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h07m58s)



[kind of want to put in a poor request to](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h08m01s)



[fix some of their tests if it was the](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h08m03s)



[same when I looked at there was some](https://youtu.be/v7m5Z8md-rI?t=02h08m06s)
