[hello everyone welcome back my apologies](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m02s)

[my live file tool that I was using uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m04s)

[apparently has some bugs and needs to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m08s)

[fixed and cleaned up we might get to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m10s)

[that tonight uh hopefully the change of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m12s)

[times didn't throw people for too much](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m15s)

[of a loop uh for people who are used to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m17s)

[it I normally stream Wednesday evenings](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m19s)

[specific time 900 p.m. um but I am](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m21s)

[moving my stream time to Thursdays just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m25s)

[gives me a bit of a break between my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m27s)

[other commitments](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m29s)

[uh and this that way hopefully I'm a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m30s)

[little more on time awake energetic Etc](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m32s)

[on the note of that tonight my goal is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m36s)

[to do the stream on only a single](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m38s)

[Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m40s)

[however my single Mountain](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m43s)

[Dew](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m46s)

[so I think I'll be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m48s)

[okay that's that's the goal so with that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m51s)

[said we're going to dive in see how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m54s)

[things go I got a lot of stuff to catch](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m57s)

[up on some stuff to fix some things to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h00m59s)

[go so first and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m01s)

[foremost let's see uh let's do this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m03s)

[there we go so pull request uh out on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m07s)

[the material design repository um this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m11s)

[is coming in uh from Ghost p uh they had](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m13s)

[reached out to me on Discord about](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m17s)

[working on this item itself anyway which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m20s)

[I need to move into the Milestone](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m22s)

[because it uh is probably getting added](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m24s)

[here um but this is specifically](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m27s)

[updating a script so something I'm not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m30s)

[sure people realize is out on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m32s)

[material design Wiki there is a um a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m34s)

[page out here where is it uh the all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m38s)

[control Styles right so this thing here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m42s)

[has all of these guys in here but for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m45s)

[each of these it just takes you to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m49s)

[the page in question it doesn't actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m52s)

[uh link you down and the idea here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h01m56s)

[um it just lists a long names of control](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m00s)

[Styles it would be ideal if these would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m03s)

[link back to the original source code um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m04s)

[and turn each of these items into a link](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m07s)

[right so right now it's just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m09s)

[doing this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m11s)

[here um and it would be more ideal if it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m13s)

[would go here and the oh stupid things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m16s)

[covering it up I can do this without it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m19s)

[the the the big idea here oh it's stupid](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m22s)

[there's a pound](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m26s)

[L um to be able to to grab it oh it does](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m27s)

[it as soon as you move](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m31s)

[off there ha H there that's what we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m34s)

[going for right that's the big idea](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m38s)

[because some of these files are big and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m40s)

[long and it's kind of obnoxious now this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m41s)

[script runs on a GitHub action that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m44s)

[triggers I think it's nightly um and so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m47s)

[it keeps the wiki up to date because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m50s)

[there's no bloody way I could maintain](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m52s)

[that like yuck but it does give a nice](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m54s)

[easy way for somebody wanting to search](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m57s)

[all of it if somebody wanted to get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h02m59s)

[really fancy and clean up the style so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m00s)

[that there was a little more logical](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m03s)

[grouping here great right like there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m06s)

[default style and all that jazz um but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m08s)

[what we have here is an update to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m13s)

[script to hopefully do that so we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m15s)

[going to take a quick Gander at this and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m18s)

[I think we're probably just going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m20s)

[to check the thing out and run it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m22s)

[because that's probably the path of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m25s)

[least resistance to make sure that this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m26s)

[works so let's see zamel path pulls in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m28s)

[the file for full name so let's expand](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m32s)

[this a little bit just so we can get a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m35s)

[little more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m36s)

[context okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m39s)

[so okay function main which I assume is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m41s)

[going to be invoked at the very bottom](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m44s)

[if I if I remember correctly yeah so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m47s)

[main is invoking main is literally the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m49s)

[only line at the bottom so we can come](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m52s)

[to the top and here we go all right IDOC](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m54s)

[secrecies of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m57s)

[Powershell uh so rips through the themes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h03m58s)

[directory that is here filtering on zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m03s)

[files for each object pulls out the zop](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m06s)

[path reads the contents into a a file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m09s)

[and then passes it in it is interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m14s)

[here I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m16s)

[surprised feels a little d uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m18s)

[duplicative to be doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m21s)

[both right because all we did is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m24s)

[separate out zaml path](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m26s)

[versus passing in file but I realize](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m31s)

[this this file is probably a misleading](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m34s)

[name here but let's go look at read all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m37s)

[zaml styles that's what was changed here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m39s)

[so extra parameter coming in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m42s)

[here let's see zop path ZL file and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m45s)

[so Z line so we're pulling in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h04m52s)

[interesting because isn't this zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m00s)

[string the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m02s)

[bits get content zaml path there's zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m06s)

[path pass it in zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m10s)

[string down here so it looks like zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m13s)

[lines and zaml string are the same thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m17s)

[I'm now checking the left just to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m20s)

[sure that something's that I'm not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m22s)

[missing something here we can go that a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m24s)

[little bigger as well okay so I'm going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m25s)

[to leave myself a a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m29s)

[note um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m32s)

[well come here so line number here so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m34s)

[this is probably what's most important](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m37s)

[to be able to get that actual line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m39s)

[number to reference](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m40s)

[back okay so get line number by key or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m47s)

[Target](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m50s)

[type this will be important because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m52s)

[Styles can be referenced either by](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m55s)

[a uh um a fixed key which in our case](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h05m58s)

[will be a string or the default style](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m02s)

[which is just the target](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m04s)

[type uh let's see zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m07s)

[lines and I wonder if the issue here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m11s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m14s)

[cast but I but it feels like I could](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m15s)

[drop this and just do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m19s)

[this but maybe there's something else](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m23s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m25s)

[missing let's see here so rips through](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m26s)

[here doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m28s)

[match does a styled line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m30s)

[number and then this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m33s)

[where the big change is coming because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m36s)

[it looks like before it was just doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m38s)

[new](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m41s)

[default uh and now it takes in a line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m43s)

[number parameter great generic also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m45s)

[takes in a new line number](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m48s)

[parameter and same here so all of these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m51s)

[ones here I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m54s)

[imagine at default style passes line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h06m58s)

[number new default passes line number](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m01s)

[new](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m04s)

[style uh let's see fixing spelling typo](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m06s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m10s)

[awesome and let's see line number there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m12s)

[line number there line number all of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m16s)

[these things are just passing all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m19s)

[way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m20s)

[through line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m22s)

[number okay okay this is just building](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m28s)

[up the style object so that it also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m31s)

[contains the line number at some point](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m34s)

[this needs to be getting used I must be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m37s)

[missing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m40s)

[it where does the actual link get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m41s)

[built Target type add style am I am I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m45s)

[did I miss](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m48s)

[it oh wait no here it is format output](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m49s)

[there we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m52s)

[go format output so those uh objects](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m55s)

[that were](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h07m59s)

[created come in here if it has a line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m00s)

[number tack on pound L style line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m05s)

[number link style and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m09s)

[name link style and name okay so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m12s)

[this looks really really close aside](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m15s)

[from that one thing that looks like it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m18s)

[might be a duplicate so let me check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m20s)

[this this guy out well move me to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m22s)

[right right so we're going to come here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m26s)

[uh right right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m28s)

[click](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m30s)

[uh uh create work tree for poll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m31s)

[requests um let's not create work tree](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m35s)

[let's just check it out it's just a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m38s)

[script it's just a script and then we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m40s)

[going to open Terminal and then if we go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m43s)

[and look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m45s)

[at where is it need the right thing um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m49s)

[if we go and look here at the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m53s)

[repo we go into GitHub workflow CL and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h08m55s)

[then uh control](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m01s)

[Styles really what I'm just after is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m04s)

[this little guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m06s)

[here uh this because I just want to know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m08s)

[what to execute from the root of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m11s)

[repo so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m13s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m17s)

[paste execute so this should generate a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m18s)

[markdown file for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m22s)

[me and then I want to go look at the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m25s)

[markdown file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m27s)

[so we're going to just open up code on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m29s)

[the repo](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m33s)

[please so for those people who missed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m35s)

[last time um get Kraken has added a cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m37s)

[new feature where you can um open up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m40s)

[your if we go in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m45s)

[here your external tools and you can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m47s)

[have your editor be a custom path in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m50s)

[this case I've set mine to visual studio](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m52s)

[rather than VSS code which is one of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m54s)

[built-in ones I guess technically the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m57s)

[only built-in one um but it does mean](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h09m59s)

[that once you set it to visual studio](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m02s)

[you lack the open in vs code option up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m03s)

[here right you now just have external](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m06s)

[editor my workaround is just to pop the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m08s)

[terminal and type code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m11s)

[period which feels like because I bounce](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m13s)

[back and forth depending on the repo as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m16s)

[far as which which one I actually want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m18s)

[to have so we'll grab this so in this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m20s)

[case what I'm kind of interested in is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m23s)

[checking these links](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m26s)

[so let's pop the previewer so the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m30s)

[the cool so this looks](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m37s)

[reasonable now the question is do these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m40s)

[links work right so if I click here does](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m42s)

[it take me to the right line](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m46s)

[number oh it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m48s)

[does oh that's nice that's nice that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m51s)

[real nice okay so the output looks](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m55s)

[correct and we can just kind of uh snipe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h10m58s)

[a couple to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m01s)

[sureal design paper secondary like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m03s)

[button okay we'll come down here clock](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m05s)

[horizontal themed why do we have clock](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m09s)

[horizontal and clock horizontal](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m12s)

[themed see this is this is why I need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m14s)

[this because it gives me a way of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m17s)

[questioning](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m20s)

[everything when did we add](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m22s)

[this themed is a bad suffix in my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m25s)

[opinion cuz it doesn't tell me anything](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m29s)

[about](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m31s)

[this secondary objective figure out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m32s)

[where the heck the themed one came from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m35s)

[uh and why but not a lot I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m38s)

[change about it here I'm surprised oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m40s)

[that's right new flipper only has the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m43s)

[one style but there is the classic uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m45s)

[flipper which was a breaking change on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m48s)

[previous](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m50s)

[ones uh material design three text](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m52s)

[blocks oh that is that is nice that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m55s)

[really nice that is good work okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h11m59s)

[the one thing I want to check though is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m01s)

[I want to see if we deal so that that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m03s)

[one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m07s)

[variable so generate theme Wiki markdown](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m08s)

[so the one thing I'm interested in uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m11s)

[later is this thing here right because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m16s)

[we pass in the zaml string and then it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m18s)

[passes in the zaml path do we need do we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m21s)

[need this is is my question right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m26s)

[because it looked like all it was using](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m29s)

[zaml path for was getting the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m30s)

[content but you already have that from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m33s)

[zaml string so can I replace zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m35s)

[lines with just zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m40s)

[string and call it a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m42s)

[day I think I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m47s)

[can but proof will be in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m49s)

[pudding run it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h12m53s)

[uh oh I saw some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m02s)

[red process cannot access because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m06s)

[another file is actively mucking with it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m09s)

[that is most likely an issue](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m12s)

[of code locking the file or Kraken](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m16s)

[locking the file but if we check this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m19s)

[out does it still](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m22s)

[work it does okay so I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m25s)

[I think that's the only issue I have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m30s)

[with it is it doesn't look like we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m32s)

[actually need zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m34s)

[lines and we could eliminate that let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m36s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m41s)

[um yeah ghost has been pretty good about](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m44s)

[being fairly responsive so let's leave](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m48s)

[some feedback here so read zaml](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m50s)

[Styles so I think what we can do is we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m54s)

[can just comment do here oh will it not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h13m57s)

[let me do it because it breaks](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m01s)

[across I want to comment on the Block](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m03s)

[there we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m06s)

[go uh let's see I think uh the dollar](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m07s)

[sign thenal](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m13s)

[path uh is not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m16s)

[needed as I believe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m19s)

[you already have the content in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m23s)

[demo](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m30s)

[string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m32s)

[uh so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m35s)

[variable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m39s)

[should probably be renamed to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m40s)

[be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m45s)

[uh sto](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m48s)

[lines okay so we can leaves a s uh well](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m50s)

[okay it's not letting me do a suggestion](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m56s)

[because this SP this is one of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h14m59s)

[dumbest things right like I want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m02s)

[leave a suggested thing but because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m04s)

[there's a break between these chunks it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m07s)

[won't let me even though they this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m08s)

[contiguous like I get it you can't leave](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m11s)

[suggestions that span get chunks because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m14s)

[this Chunk in this case is one line but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m19s)

[it may be lots of lines so I get why](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m21s)

[it's not allowed but it's just ah it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m24s)

[one of those the the implementation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m27s)

[details of git are getting in the way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m30s)

[of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m33s)

[um good stuff other than that I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m36s)

[this is really](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m38s)

[good like it works it generates the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m41s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m44s)

[output](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m46s)

[uh great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m49s)

[work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m53s)

[one small comment](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h15m55s)

[uh okay so I think we're just going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m04s)

[do that and that will get that off and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m07s)

[running okay next thing on the chopping](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m10s)

[block next thing on the chopping block](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m15s)

[do I do velop Pac or do I do live file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m17s)

[stuff I broke I broke two things kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m19s)

[want to fix the live file stuff since](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m23s)

[it's breaking my stream that kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m25s)

[gives me a bit of pause so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m27s)

[let's jump gears here so this live file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m30s)

[app was something that we were uh worked](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m35s)

[on last time this is a very simple CLI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m37s)

[application that just writes out a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m41s)

[countdown timer to a file with an ending](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m44s)

[message for those of you who tune in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m47s)

[early to my streams you will note that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m49s)

[there is typically a countdown with a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m51s)

[stream starting soon message almost as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m53s)

[though somebody in their Infinite](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h16m57s)

[Wisdom did something like this right and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m00s)

[just did a a quick countdown and Off to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m04s)

[the Races now something went wrong](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m06s)

[tonight because well multiple things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m09s)

[went wrong first thing that went wrong](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m11s)

[is I'm an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m14s)

[idiot so I tried to install my Global](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m16s)

[tool and I got this lovely air I think I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m18s)

[still have it up yes I do I got this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m22s)

[lovely air here saying hey you can't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m25s)

[install this nougat package as a as a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m29s)

[tool the nougat package because you'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m31s)

[note here this is my net tool store blah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m34s)

[blah blah where it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m37s)

[extracted that it expected a tools](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m39s)

[directory and it's it's not there and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m41s)

[I'm like well that's dumb I open up the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m44s)

[NIT package and sure enough there's no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m45s)

[tools directory there that's how Global](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m47s)

[tools work right if you don't have a uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m49s)

[a tools directory it no work for example](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m52s)

[if we look at one of my other ones uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m56s)

[let's see auto typer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h17m58s)

[right I really should I I need to get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m02s)

[better at making myself icons the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m05s)

[material design project actually has an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m07s)

[icon Builder maybe we'll add an icon](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m09s)

[that'd be cool um if we open up this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m11s)

[package right yeah so so Pro tip you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m14s)

[can you can actually open up packages](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m19s)

[you'll note here unlike this other one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m22s)

[that just has a lip directory it's got a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m24s)

[tools directory and inside of it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m26s)

[it's got stuff lots of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m29s)

[stuff and more importantly like there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m32s)

[a global tool in here and you can like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m36s)

[ship this thing right huzzah like that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m39s)

[that's kind of what we're going for so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m43s)

[think I think I messed up last time I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m46s)

[think what I had done is I I did this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m49s)

[single file garbage self-contained](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m52s)

[garbage and I think that's what bit me I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m55s)

[think that's what bit me because I got](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h18m58s)

[rid of and I if I look back at my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m00s)

[commits I noticed remove pack as tool I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m04s)

[think this is where I went wrong right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m07s)

[this is what I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m10s)

[wanted but it gave me an air on my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m11s)

[pipeline so I threw it away and went oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m14s)

[okay I don't need that right because if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m16s)

[we look out on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m18s)

[repo I go and look at my my GitHub](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m21s)

[actions](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m23s)

[right I think this one here yeah package](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m27s)

[tool does not support](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m31s)

[self-contained correct and the reason it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m33s)

[doesn't support self-contained and you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m36s)

[you kind of get a hint here you'll note](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m38s)

[there's no XY in this right it's because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m40s)

[a global tool has to be able to work on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m44s)

[more than just Windows now I'm running](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m47s)

[Windows so that's all I care about but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m49s)

[in order for this to work net has to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m52s)

[able to effectively Run net run against](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m54s)

[your assembly right so when you do uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h19m57s)

[self-contained you're packaging that in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m02s)

[and it doesn't work right so I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m04s)

[what I did](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m07s)

[wrong and I I I should have realized](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m09s)

[this like I should have realized my hang](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m12s)

[on I got too much crap open see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m18s)

[close this is my yeah so this is my my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m20s)

[net templates and I should have realized](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m24s)

[that my publishing stuff doesn't have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m27s)

[any of that self-contained stuff in here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m31s)

[right it has this this is what it needs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m33s)

[to publish as a global tool and I've](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m36s)

[published stuff with my template before](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m38s)

[I should have realized my template is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m41s)

[right the other stuff is wrong right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m43s)

[this is what it should be so this should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m46s)

[be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m49s)

[here this should be here and this is how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m50s)

[it should be built right that that is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m53s)

[that is the fix we're going to bump the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m57s)

[version because I need it to publish to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h20m59s)

[nit we're going to let that sucker run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m01s)

[Master push Off to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m15s)

[Races okay now there may be one more bug](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m22s)

[around the ending text but I'll chase](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m25s)

[that a later point we're going to let](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m28s)

[that we're going to let that guy fly for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m30s)

[Now actions just going to just going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m32s)

[let that sit off to the side where I can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m36s)

[keep an eye on it and monitor it okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m38s)

[next up next up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m41s)

[bellack okay so there's a couple there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m44s)

[a couple things going on here that are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m48s)

[worth explaining](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m51s)

[so kayin and I have been working on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m53s)

[trying to get this guy ready to go and I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m56s)

[got too much stuff open so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h21m59s)

[just start closing some stuff down there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m01s)

[we go okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m04s)

[so Bop Pac right so anybody who's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m06s)

[interested vac. is the website huzzah we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m10s)

[can pop that sucker open all right cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m15s)

[stuff here but more importantly on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m19s)

[GitHub it is open source or at least the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m21s)

[the portion we're going to be playing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m25s)

[with today is the this guy here so uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m26s)

[the big portion of velop Pac is the VPK](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m30s)

[tool so if we look at our docs which I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m33s)

[have been writing more of riding a lot](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m36s)

[more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m38s)

[of and we we may we may build out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m39s)

[another sample app I had somebody ask](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m41s)

[for uh Windows forms so I may I may add](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m43s)

[a sample in there just to just to get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m47s)

[things going a little smoother uh it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m49s)

[kind of annoying to maintain a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m51s)

[samples but I I've been trying to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m52s)

[sure we get better docks uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m54s)

[here oh I'm going to point this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m57s)

[out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h22m59s)

[uhm signing with Azure trusted signing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m01s)

[so if you want to do Azure trusted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m04s)

[signing I have written up the steps if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m06s)

[anybody would like to test them feel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m09s)

[free but I believe all of these are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m11s)

[accurate and if you find any missing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m13s)

[bits the docs repo is also open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m15s)

[source uh what oh this takes you to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m20s)

[wrong one um no remind me later go away](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m22s)

[little busy the doc repo is also open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m27s)

[source and you can just PR straight into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m29s)

[there to uh suggest feedback but there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m31s)

[is azure trusted signing is all set up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m35s)

[there there's a lot of setup steps to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m38s)

[get Azure trusted signing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m40s)

[going but like Steps one through eight](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m43s)

[are your onetime setups and step nine is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m46s)

[what you then do going forward right so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m50s)

[1 through eight is getting Azure trusted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m52s)

[signing hooked up which is by far one of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m54s)

[the cheapest](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m57s)

[most cost effective ways to do signing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h23m59s)

[of your apps like this uh where is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m02s)

[it yeah this is dirt cheap compared to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m07s)

[most signing options you go and look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m12s)

[what it costs you to sign your app](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m13s)

[otherwise 10 bucks a month is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m16s)

[nothing um yeah and this gives you 5,000](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m20s)

[signatures it's worth noting that 5,000](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m24s)

[is every](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m27s)

[uh file you need sign so if you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m29s)

[signing a whole bunch of dlls it may not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m30s)

[be one per per app but velop Pac will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m32s)

[only try to sign the unsigned stuff so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m36s)

[like this is this is a lot a lot um so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m40s)

[yeah so it is it is worth going so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m46s)

[unless you need something more than like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m47s)

[one of each certificate profile type](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m50s)

[right this is where most people are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m53s)

[going to land unless you are unless](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m55s)

[you're a big Enterprise are probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m57s)

[Landing in the basic tier and if you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h24m58s)

[a big Enterprise that need more stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m00s)

[you can land in the premium tier but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m02s)

[even this is like this is cheaper than](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m03s)

[some other people's code signing CTS so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m06s)

[just yeah Microsoft's typical strategy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m10s)

[of rather than competing with people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m13s)

[will just make our stuff cheap cheap](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m15s)

[enough to let them go out of business](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m17s)

[which seems to be a very effective](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m19s)

[strategy for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m21s)

[them um okay anyway so so all of this in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m22s)

[here but suffice it to say one of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m25s)

[things that we are working on uh is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m28s)

[something we call velop Pac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m33s)

[flow so people are getting a preview a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m35s)

[preview hang on I got to sign in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m38s)

[apparently I'm not signed in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m41s)

[yet do the do the do the AY bits okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m45s)

[you sign in this is vack flow this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m49s)

[live](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m52s)

[production now I'm going to point out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m54s)

[this is live production on some that we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m56s)

[haven't officially launched so this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h25m58s)

[still kind of beta and by Beta we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m01s)

[haven't really let other people in so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m04s)

[it's like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m06s)

[eh there right technically anybody can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m07s)

[sign up but I make no promises uh as to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m10s)

[the state of this until we actually get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m14s)

[to release but the the idea here is um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m16s)

[you uh so back got you log in you have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m21s)

[your projects right secretly above](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m25s)

[projects is teams right and team the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m28s)

[team level is where you have like your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m32s)

[subscription we have a free tier uh and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m34s)

[then there's uh a couple paid tier](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m37s)

[options depending on what people need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m39s)

[but we tried to do a generous free tier](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m42s)

[so that people could get a very good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m44s)

[idea of what this is now do you need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m45s)

[this for vpac no you only need this if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m48s)

[you don't want to deal with trying to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m51s)

[host your app yourself right so if you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m53s)

[if you just want to use the velop Pac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m56s)

[and installer the SDK build your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m58s)

[installers do your own hosting great you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h26m59s)

[can run with the free SDK and tooling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m02s)

[you're Off to the Races good to go right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m04s)

[the moment you're like well I don't want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m07s)

[to deal with the hosting and soon like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m08s)

[we're going to have Azure trusted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m11s)

[signing integration and siging and all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m12s)

[that that's where you fall here right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m15s)

[that's that's the sweet spot for for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m18s)

[flow um so but underneath your team you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m20s)

[then end up with your various projects](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m23s)

[your teams have members billing uh you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m25s)

[can do API access if you want to do this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m28s)

[on a cicd type setup right there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m30s)

[there's some there's some settings here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m33s)

[not a lot but you know little bit right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m35s)

[so that that gets you that gets you into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m37s)

[there um inside of a project you have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m40s)

[various release channels so especially](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m43s)

[in this case where it's like an avalone](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m45s)

[app I might be building something that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m47s)

[targets windows I might be building](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m49s)

[something that targets Mac I might be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m50s)

[building something that targets Linux](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m52s)

[those are separate um build artifacts](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m54s)

[that come out for each of those so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m57s)

[have a separate channel for Windows I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h27m59s)

[have a separate channel for Mac I have a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m01s)

[separate one for Linux um maybe I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m03s)

[to have a beta and a release channel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m05s)

[right like channels are functionally](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m07s)

[just named channels I don't know how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m10s)

[that's probably a poor way of describing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m14s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m15s)

[uh uh channel is like a a stream of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m17s)

[release artifacts that are version right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m20s)

[because just because it's version one on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m22s)

[Windows doesn't necessarily mean it'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m23s)

[be version one on Mac you should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m25s)

[probably release together but but you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m27s)

[don't have to right beta and and prod](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m28s)

[may may be on different versioning](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m30s)

[schemes great fine have at it right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m32s)

[inside of a channel what you end up with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m35s)

[um and this doesn't have the latest UI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m38s)

[on here which we're going to look at in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m40s)

[a minute um underneath a channel is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m41s)

[release group because once we start](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m43s)

[talking about Windows there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m45s)

[potentially several physical files that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m47s)

[go into a a particular release and so a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m50s)

[release group houses all of those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m53s)

[files right and so that's where that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m56s)

[where our Story](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h28m59s)

[begins](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m01s)

[so if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m02s)

[we go and look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m04s)

[at yeah reload reload so uh Kaylin and I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m07s)

[were working on updating our our](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m13s)

[publishing flow right and he was working](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m16s)

[on the CLI side and you can see just a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m19s)

[just a little bit of work here right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m23s)

[like there's there's you know just a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m25s)

[just a little bit of stuff that happened](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m29s)

[not a ton but you know a bit um a but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m31s)

[around doing this when you go to publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m36s)

[the the backend API will not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m40s)

[automatically create projects for you it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m43s)

[will not automatically create channels](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m45s)

[for you it expects you to um create](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m47s)

[those intentionally rather than having](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m51s)

[them magically spawn because if you typo](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m52s)

[something we don't want to magically](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m55s)

[make something appear](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m56s)

[with that said the back end won't do it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h29m59s)

[however we can make tooling kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m01s)

[smooth that over because in a lot of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m04s)

[cases it's like well I kind of do just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m06s)

[want you to make that for me because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m08s)

[that demos really well and makes it look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m11s)

[a lot cooler if I don't have to think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m13s)

[real hard it's like great we can do that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m15s)

[so the the back end won't do it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m18s)

[automatically for you but we can make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m19s)

[the tooling on the front side do it so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m21s)

[it you kind of end up with the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m23s)

[effect right but that that's a subtle](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m25s)

[subtle difference especially if you like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m28s)

[hit velop pac's API directly which we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m30s)

[have a Swagger page and whatnot if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m33s)

[people want to build tooling against it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m34s)

[um that the back end's not doing it so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m37s)

[if you want that nicity stuff you kind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m40s)

[of have to to do that kind of work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m42s)

[yourself right so uh these are then](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m44s)

[Kaylin updating this and the last](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m48s)

[message she sent me look at it he ran](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m50s)

[into some issues](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m54s)

[with uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m56s)

[a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h30m58s)

[400 because of an air and then it had to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m01s)

[bounce so because he had holiday plans](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m05s)

[as well so I was going to dive in and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m08s)

[see what was going on and this this is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m10s)

[consistent problem with us](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m12s)

[right um but I have one more trick up my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m15s)

[sleeve I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m20s)

[have this is not a public repo but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m22s)

[have this repo](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m25s)

[right so this repo here runs end to end](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m28s)

[test for me and I like this repo this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m32s)

[repos exists for Kevin wanting to do his](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m35s)

[own testing and not wanting to think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m39s)

[real hard because thinking is hard so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m41s)

[specifically there's an avalone app in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m45s)

[here the app is irrelevant uh the app](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m47s)

[literally is I think the default](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m50s)

[avalonia for hello world yeah greeting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m52s)

[yeah so it's it's the default avalonia](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m55s)

[so nothing fancy at all it just I needed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h31m57s)

[an app uh and I was having fun with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m01s)

[avalonia so yeah We're Off to the Races](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m03s)

[right um what this thing here does is it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m06s)

[does a bunch of work so specifically I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m10s)

[can point it either local or remote](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m14s)

[depending on how I want to do this and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m15s)

[again this is this is literally called](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m17s)

[end to end testing because it's it's my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m19s)

[idea of end to end](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m22s)

[testing but if we and in some ways it'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m24s)

[try to like start my Aspire stuff and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m28s)

[all of that jazz but in this case I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m30s)

[I'm killing it and I'm running it local](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m32s)

[because I had some issues and didn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m35s)

[want to didn't want to fuss with them um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m36s)

[but if we go where's my stuff where's my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m39s)

[stuff there's project Channel start](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m43s)

[start there so restores my my local](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m47s)

[tools publishes Lo or uh pushes me into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m51s)

[the test project cleans out the releases](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m55s)

[directory so effectively it's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h32m58s)

[be pushing release one every single time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m00s)

[um because the idea is we want to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m03s)

[able to to clean up after ourselves uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m05s)

[builds a release sets the version so if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m08s)

[I want to change the version I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m11s)

[wondering why did I set version down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m12s)

[here that's dumb version should really](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m15s)

[live up here alongside everything](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m17s)

[else there put version](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m21s)

[there I'm just going to make sure I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m23s)

[don't have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m25s)

[another shouldn't break anything good uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m26s)

[does a net publish does a VPK pack We're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m30s)

[Off to the Races right so this is this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m32s)

[is literally all of the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m35s)

[stuff um pops us out starts the local](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m37s)

[server this is going to know op and do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m41s)

[nothing so it doesn't matter logs me in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m42s)

[uh to the API using our VPK login great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m46s)

[this ensures that the project exists so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m50s)

[again the the the auto creation doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m52s)

[occur uh on the back end it occurs on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m55s)

[the the front end and this is using](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h33m58s)

[Powershell not the VPK](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m00s)

[command um and so this was building that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m02s)

[up this was then creating the channel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m05s)

[and then this was then publishing it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m07s)

[just so I could see it all work and then](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m09s)

[this was you know more work to do in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m11s)

[future so this is kind of where we're at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m14s)

[but I was curious to see what all klin](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m17s)

[had done on his whole request because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m20s)

[that's kind of where this thing starts](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m23s)

[because I got requested](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m25s)

[to change this so let's see let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m28s)

[renovate renovate renovate o it's going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m30s)

[to rev packages I'm curious which ones](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m33s)

[it's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m35s)

[rev huh that's interesting um we've been](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m37s)

[playing around with renovate instead of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m40s)

[dependabot I go back and forth](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m44s)

[dependabot](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m46s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m47s)

[Dependable but renovates been around a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m49s)

[little longer and has a lot nicer I'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m52s)

[say fully fleshed feature set so you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m55s)

[know it can go back and forth okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h34m58s)

[let's take a look so there are a number](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m01s)

[of key things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m04s)

[here generate API end points using n](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m05s)

[swag which this gives me pause](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m09s)

[immediately because I ICN swag generates](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m11s)

[some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m15s)

[garbage](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m16s)

[uh uh with the way process handling is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m21s)

[done with an extra o for bonus](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m23s)

[points let's see Auto create channel and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m26s)

[publish Auto download previous release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m28s)

[because when you do a vel pack um or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m31s)

[should say when you do a VPK pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m34s)

[command if there is a prior release it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m36s)

[will generate you a Delta package](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m39s)

[between the prior release and the new](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m41s)

[release which is our Delta package so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m43s)

[when I was talking about that release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m46s)

[group having more than one thing in it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m47s)

[that's one of the extra things that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m49s)

[might be in there is a Delta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m50s)

[package uh adds fancy progress to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m52s)

[publish which I can only assume](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h35m55s)

[uh what is the name of the package why](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m00s)

[am I blanking on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m02s)

[name it's not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m07s)

[curses oh what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m11s)

[is uh starts with an S why am I why am I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m13s)

[blanking on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m16s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m17s)

[um we'll get down to it and I'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m19s)

[remember it here in just a moment okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m22s)

[so first and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m24s)

[foremost it's splitting off and and some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m25s)

[of this may actually fix the problem](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m28s)

[that we looked at before where we were](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m30s)

[dealing with signing issues](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m33s)

[on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m36s)

[um this always gives me pause internals](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m39s)

[visible](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m43s)

[too](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m47s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m50s)

[yeah I that always gives me a lot of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m52s)

[pause TFM support build warnings this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m55s)

[going to be the net 9 suppression bits](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h36m58s)

[this is just a basic build script for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m02s)

[publishing that's fine and this is just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m06s)

[going to be the new projects okay great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m09s)

[so there's 97 files here buckle up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m12s)

[that's why we've got an appropriate 97](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m16s)

[file mug for the code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m18s)

[revie because sometimes for those people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m22s)

[who can't read it says](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m25s)

[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m28s)

[Christmas for people watching this in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m30s)

[the future hi YouTube uh this is being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m32s)

[recorded on December 26th IE the day](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m34s)

[after Christmas in the US okay so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m37s)

[moved out of the project up to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m40s)

[directory build props this is one of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m42s)

[most obnoxious things with GitHub is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m44s)

[slowness in which you have a big PR](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m47s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m49s)

[happen okay so what do we got here so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m52s)

[this was an additional overload to run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m54s)

[Tas](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h37m57s)

[what is different here run task oh this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m04s)

[is run task of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m06s)

[T that is fine because this is just the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m18s)

[MS build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m21s)

[logger okay publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m25s)

[task okay so service URL was made](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m28s)

[nullable that gives me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m34s)

[pause but not enough pause to change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m38s)

[anything yet let's see so there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m41s)

[timeout being added](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m44s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m50s)

[um the only thing that I don't like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m52s)

[about a timeout being added like this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m55s)

[it doesn't give me any idea of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h38m56s)

[units and especially since seeing that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m02s)

[this one was done like that that that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m05s)

[also gives me a bit of pause so we'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m07s)

[see this was a static HTTP client I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m12s)

[curious](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m15s)

[where it must have been it must be moved](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m17s)

[down inside of the service client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m20s)

[because I'm guessing this is no longer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m23s)

[needed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m25s)

[actually I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m28s)

[realizing HTTP client was passed in and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m29s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m32s)

[wondering low service client must handle](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m34s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m36s)

[itself yesing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m37s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m41s)

[so and then wait for live so this thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m43s)

[is waiting to see when the thing is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m47s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m49s)

[enabled okay I'll have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m54s)

[I might I might want to come back to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m58s)

[that as well there's some Auto](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h39m59s)

[publishing that happens with release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m01s)

[groups where you can um automatically](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m03s)

[publish them once all the files have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m07s)

[been uploaded and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m08s)

[processed but we may take a look at this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m10s)

[um this also gives me pause when I see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m13s)

[double logger because it makes me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m15s)

[question what the Constructor is but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m16s)

[typically that's an indication that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m20s)

[something needs two separate interfaces](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m22s)

[in the same instance is implementing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m24s)

[them both I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m26s)

[think considering this is Ms build async](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m28s)

[task I'm guessing one of these is like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m31s)

[ey logger and one of these is the MS](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m33s)

[build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m35s)

[logger yeah because previously I only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m38s)

[had one on there okay so let's see we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m40s)

[create a client we create a cancellation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m43s)

[token](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m46s)

[none why don't we feed in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m49s)

[cancellation token from here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m51s)

[gives me a bit of pause that we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h40m57s)

[using that we're using one cancellation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m03s)

[token for login but not the same one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m06s)

[because this obviously means you can no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m11s)

[longer cancel the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m12s)

[login yeah that gives me that gives me a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m19s)

[bit of pause okay this is using don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m22s)

[care uh project reference so the build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m24s)

[project now references flow that doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m27s)

[matter Nam space don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m30s)

[care Nam space don't care namespace](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m33s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m36s)

[care okay fancy console](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m37s)

[progress I do wonder why this is a funk](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m48s)

[rather like Funk of action](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h41m51s)

[this feels like like this action of int](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m00s)

[it feels like something that should be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m03s)

[an eye progress rather than an action](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m04s)

[event well look I'm intentionally not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m10s)

[checking the boxes on things that I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m13s)

[to go look at more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m15s)

[closely uh let's see here have we not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m18s)

[enabled the newer stuff we may not have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m22s)

[the newer SDK stuff uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m24s)

[um I also don't like this I like to turn](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m27s)

[on nullability whenever possible but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m30s)

[also realize that that bloats stuff I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m33s)

[also curious why this oh this is a build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m35s)

[assets so this is expected to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m38s)

[serializable this is expected to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m44s)

[serializable relative file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m49s)

[names interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m54s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h42m56s)

[okay again I want to look at it closer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m03s)

[because it gives me pause knowing that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m06s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m08s)

[is uh something that I don't fully](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m10s)

[understand yet which means I want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m14s)

[look at it closer uh I and by look at it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m16s)

[closer I mean look at it in the IDE](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m18s)

[nodding GitHub but I find that I like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m22s)

[looking at it this way initially](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m25s)

[so some of this stuff gets just a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m27s)

[release name like this looks wacky but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m29s)

[this is also pre-existing cuz I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m32s)

[recognize some of this so I think a lot](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m34s)

[of these are we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m37s)

[seeing uh a Delta where there's a file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m39s)

[deleted and this is probably a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m41s)

[reflective of just moving between those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m43s)

[new project structures so I I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m45s)

[that's probably what's going on there uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m48s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m51s)

[see this one on here These Warnings I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m55s)

[I'm likely to go and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h43m58s)

[address because this should get fixed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m00s)

[right because this is now in vopat core](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m05s)

[and this is one of those areas where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m07s)

[it's like I like fixing my nullability](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m09s)

[stuff they're annoying to fix but dear](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m11s)

[Heavens they're so convenient when they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m13s)

[do um okay this is name space change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m16s)

[don't care this is moving things into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m19s)

[vopat core and so vopat core gets to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m21s)

[interesting because it's expected to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m25s)

[shared across so many things our tfms](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m27s)

[are kind of older implicit usings n](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m29s)

[ability enabled I am curious I thought I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m32s)

[saw a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m35s)

[directory build do props](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m36s)

[yeah do we not have some of like the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m39s)

[nullability stuff and whatnot enabled](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m42s)

[there must](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m45s)

[not doesn't look like it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m49s)

[so this guy here may legitimately be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m52s)

[needed on all of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h44m58s)

[stuff I'm curious about the Newton stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m02s)

[stuff yeah old 6.net yeah the the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m05s)

[hard part here is because this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m09s)

[actually a library where we kind of do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m11s)

[care to have back compat a little bit we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m14s)

[are targeting older stuff I am tempted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m16s)

[to bump this to multi-target net 8 as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m20s)

[well but nothing should be referencing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m22s)

[this Direct](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m26s)

[this is a shared Library across our](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m27s)

[other public](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m29s)

[libraries there's a bit of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m32s)

[that so we'll I'll look and see this it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m35s)

[could](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m39s)

[be yeah this may be something that just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m40s)

[gets bumped um but I also realize](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m43s)

[that sometimes we just got to get this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m48s)

[merged and then Circle back these are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m50s)

[all fine because those are just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m53s)

[referencing the other things that I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m54s)

[to go look at closer don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m56s)

[care this is moving name space change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h45m59s)

[don't care API command Runner so this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m02s)

[one of the more interesting ones so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m06s)

[added in a command to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m08s)

[VPK um specifically to support where is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m10s)

[it so you'll note here right like I have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m15s)

[this Powershell that says get project ID](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m17s)

[if we go up here and look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m20s)

[this this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m22s)

[running VPK flow API so this is a hidden](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m25s)

[command just to be clear so and hidden](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m29s)

[command inside a VPK means you're free](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m31s)

[to use it uh but treat it with care](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m34s)

[because I reserve the right to change it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m37s)

[at any point um it's it's beta uh and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m39s)

[breaking changes may](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m43s)

[occur but this kind of is modeled after](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m47s)

[how like the the Azure CLI Works where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m50s)

[they've got this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m53s)

[arbitrary um kind of raw API command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m55s)

[where you can specify an HTTP method an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h46m58s)

[endpoint your base URL um and you can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m01s)

[just fire raw data up and the advantage](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m06s)

[of doing this is then you don't have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m09s)

[deal with the off right VPK login you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m11s)

[done don't worry about it right just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m14s)

[like the how the Azure CLI works so I I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m16s)

[blatantly poached that design from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m20s)

[them which that's what this API command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m24s)

[Runner is doing um this one it makes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m27s)

[sense to have token none go through](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m30s)

[because there are no other tokens coming](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m33s)

[in so this I think is just a lift and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m36s)

[shift of where the command Runner was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m40s)

[before these are all those same end](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m42s)

[points all it makes sense and even](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m46s)

[though these things look like they're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m49s)

[like oh what is possible we've got to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m50s)

[the the CLI ensures that these things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m53s)

[get set because you can't invoke an API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m56s)

[without specifying an endpoint right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h47m58s)

[like that's that's dumb you you kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m00s)

[have to say what endpoint the API is um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m02s)

[this is just the login command this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m06s)

[just moving stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m07s)

[around login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m11s)

[options Runner so there's not a lot in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m12s)

[any of these publish is the same thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m15s)

[right and you'll note this login stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m20s)

[most of these even though it's doing a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m22s)

[login it's only allowing the cash as a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m23s)

[possible source so it's not going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m27s)

[like pop an interactive login flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m29s)

[because you do a publish it expects that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m31s)

[you've done a VPK login first um and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m33s)

[done the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m36s)

[needful right before pushing that up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m38s)

[let's see publish Target OS release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m41s)

[directory Channel wait for live this one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m44s)

[I'm I really want to find implementation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m47s)

[for cuz](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m50s)

[that low API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m52s)

[this oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m55s)

[oh hang on I just opened large diffs I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h48m57s)

[have a yeah this is the n swag okay yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m01s)

[this is the n swag file um I may look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m03s)

[and see if we can find this my I have a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m06s)

[small preference to putting dog. CS when](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m08s)

[things are autogenerated by tools](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m12s)

[there's a handful of things when uh what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m14s)

[is considered](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m18s)

[autogenerated uh by things like Roslin](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m20s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m22s)

[not statically set there's a a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m23s)

[of different things that it looks for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m26s)

[this comment being one of themg docs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m28s)

[being another one um and so it will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m31s)

[figure out what oh look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m34s)

[that that's the thing I want to fix](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m39s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m41s)

[there okay so that's that's where it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m43s)

[generating from okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m46s)

[cool cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m48s)

[see I like kayin loves writing scripts](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m51s)

[for stuff like this and I it it does](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m54s)

[make my life easier then I don't have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m56s)

[think real hard](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h49m58s)

[um okay so partial class profile so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m01s)

[is just building](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m04s)

[out uh partial things against what was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m07s)

[generated on the other side](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m10s)

[great uh let's see here download](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m13s)

[why local file is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m25s)

[string just I have I have this thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m27s)

[where I like things like files to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m31s)

[file infos](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m33s)

[but file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m37s)

[create I'm trying to remember what file.](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m41s)

[create does on existing I think it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m43s)

[overwrites I think it over we're leaving](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m46s)

[this unchecked I want to look at this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h50m49s)

[down uh that looks like probably a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m01s)

[mistake on my part for not using the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m04s)

[right base Constructor so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m05s)

[great uh let's see name](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m09s)

[space this gives me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m13s)

[pause bellack flow did we see the CSR](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m15s)

[for that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m19s)

[already did that enable nullability](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m21s)

[actually you know what why am I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m28s)

[asking just I've got it checked out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m30s)

[nullable enabled okay cool cool cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m33s)

[cool so the the nullability being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m36s)

[removed there totally fine it's enabled](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m38s)

[at the project oh look it was literally](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m40s)

[the next file down I'm an idiot okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m43s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m47s)

[here again kind of makes me want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m48s)

[Target net](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m51s)

[8 but it again it's internal so not a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m53s)

[big deal at the moment B Pack Flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h51m57s)

[options this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m00s)

[dropping so I'm noticing the service](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m05s)

[options Base Class is gone and this one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m09s)

[allowed for a base URL to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m11s)

[specified I feel a little weird about](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m14s)

[this because on one hand I like the base](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m16s)

[URL knowing that we're going to have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m19s)

[like a Dev and a prod environment and I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m21s)

[want a way to override the base to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m23s)

[change change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m26s)

[it but I do realize it probably exposed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m27s)

[it in some like for example](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m31s)

[my my little script here you'll note my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m34s)

[base URL is very like some of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m36s)

[options that were put on there were put](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m39s)

[on there specifically to support my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m41s)

[flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m44s)

[um so that might be something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m47s)

[worth I'm curious](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m51s)

[why login does doesn't change like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m54s)

[doesn't allow you to change the off](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h52m58s)

[because you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m00s)

[can't yeah we're going to leave that one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m01s)

[I want to look at that because without](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m03s)

[being able to change it I can't log into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m04s)

[like my local server or similar I also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m06s)

[once again I see this timeout and it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m10s)

[gives me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m12s)

[pause because I I want to look at this I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m14s)

[part of me really really likes timeouts](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m18s)

[being specified As Time spans because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m20s)

[they're a lot more explicit on what you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m22s)

[mean by it when you say 30 do you mean](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m24s)

[seconds minutes hours right milliseconds](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m26s)

[those are not always clear](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m30s)

[things okay so flow service client this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m33s)

[is going to be the meat and potatoes in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m36s)

[a lot of this okay the progress as an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m38s)

[action that gives](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m41s)

[me again gives me a gives me mild](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m46s)

[amounts of Paws](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m49s)

[but args progress percentage](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h53m51s)

[this is send this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m01s)

[receive interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m07s)

[okay this is the why the need for doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m12s)

[that because this is wrapping it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m16s)

[deeper](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m20s)

[okay and if no progress don't bother to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m24s)

[do any of this setup](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m27s)

[stuff then a new HTTP client with the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m29s)

[Handler and this is why it wasn't done](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m33s)

[as a static this does give me a bit of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m36s)

[pause so here's the other reason right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m39s)

[because the the double is now converted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m42s)

[to a time span much nicer just as a time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m44s)

[span interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m52s)

[this also strikes me as something that I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m56s)

[kind of like I realize I started this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h54m58s)

[pattern but this feels like something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m01s)

[that I might want to do with an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m03s)

[HTTP context Factory the other thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m05s)

[that's worth noting like even though](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m08s)

[this isn't a great way of doing HTTP](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m10s)

[clients it's also not likely to bite us](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m12s)

[because this is executed in a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m17s)

[CLI that has a somewhat short lifespan](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m19s)

[like it's going to spin one of these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m23s)

[things up do an AP interaction and then](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m24s)

[bring itself back down like the process](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m27s)

[is terminating so it's it's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m31s)

[clean up for itself by virtue](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m32s)

[of not existing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m37s)

[anymore uh let's see so it checks for a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m40s)

[different base URL overrides](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m42s)

[it great wait](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m45s)

[which confused where did those options](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m48s)

[come](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m51s)

[from where are where huh oh there they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m52s)

[are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m55s)

[upack flow service options okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m56s)

[something's this is the difference fancy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h55m58s)

[logger and ey](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m00s)

[logger](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m02s)

[huh it feels weird to split](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m04s)

[those it feels very weird to split](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m07s)

[those right because part of me is like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m13s)

[why why are we not just doing them both](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m16s)

[I like I there's a logging problem here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m18s)

[and I feel like I I want to correct it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m30s)

[but again I we can't let that get in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m33s)

[way of actually shipping so you know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m37s)

[cleanup may happen](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m40s)

[later get flow API base Ur hold on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m44s)

[where's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m47s)

[get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m51s)

[o o](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h56m53s)

[o all of that to get a service](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m04s)

[URL for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m09s)

[logging](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m15s)

[that yeah that doesn't feel good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m18s)

[sorry EPO R not entirely sure all I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m28s)

[getting on my chat are black](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m33s)

[boxes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m38s)

[um yeah so this okay so this so in some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m40s)

[ways this is a cleanup of or or a change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m45s)

[of some of the code I had which most of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m48s)

[this I recognize as things that were](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m51s)

[just lifted and shifted with this change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m53s)

[to being the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m55s)

[client it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h57m57s)

[does somewhat concern me that we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m01s)

[doing this whole flow API client just to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m03s)

[get the base](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m06s)

[URL that's a that's a lot of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m09s)

[instantiations just to get a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m11s)

[string I I think we can probably clean](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m14s)

[some of that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m17s)

[up um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m19s)

[okay this upload latest release assets](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m21s)

[this is going to be the one where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m25s)

[there's probably a 400 somewhere in here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m26s)

[ho ve ho](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m29s)

[ve uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m33s)

[yeah so parallel process](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m37s)

[uploading I do love](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m42s)

[this because this is a a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m45s)

[throwaway let's see background task](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m48s)

[where do you get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m51s)

[awaited something down here is going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m53s)

[be watching for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m55s)

[for when all there we are background](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h58m57s)

[task](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m01s)

[ho so downloading Delta base suggesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m04s)

[Delta name run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m08s)

[task publishing release wait for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m12s)

[live wait until release group](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m17s)

[Live what interests me is this feels](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m21s)

[yeah most of the time this publishing to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m28s)

[release group Live is going to be fairly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m30s)

[fast I mean some of it depends on how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m34s)

[big your files are and the processing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m36s)

[time of them but it's probably not going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m38s)

[to be that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m41s)

[long get flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m44s)

[API it does also interest me this get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m49s)

[flow API inside of each of these is like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m52s)

[that feels like a fairly heavyweight](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m55s)

[thing to instantiate every time so maybe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=00h59m57s)

[we're my idea of we're creating one and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m00s)

[throwing it away may not be perfectly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m02s)

[accurate wait until release group live](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m04s)

[because it's getting a new flow client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m06s)

[every single](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m08s)

[time that feels](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m10s)

[heavy uh let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m13s)

[see I to 300 get release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m16s)

[group so this is waiting up to 30](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m21s)

[minutes but is respecting the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m24s)

[cancellation which is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m26s)

[good um I'm curious what happens on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m30s)

[cancellation so I didn't see anything uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m35s)

[trapping operation canceled](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m38s)

[exception so that that gives me bit of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m40s)

[pause so create channel request so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m44s)

[should work as expected cre re group](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m47s)

[great upload release assets publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h00m51s)

[look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h01m38s)

[don't have to look at it anymore okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h01m42s)

[okay there we go uh let's see here Delta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m38s)

[package options see again this is one of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m42s)

[those things yeah line ands don't care](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m44s)

[do not care in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m47s)

[least uh let's see what is this Delta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m50s)

[package Builder](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m53s)

[output](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m56s)

[file is this literally](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h02m58s)

[just oh so if uh if it's not empty or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m02s)

[the file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m07s)

[exists interesting I feel like I would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m10s)

[have split those across two different](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m12s)

[ifs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m14s)

[to handle a better message but whatever](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m15s)

[let's see parallel for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m18s)

[each okay this was actually interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m21s)

[so I I was teaching at uh local](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m24s)

[University not that long ago and I was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m28s)

[doing uh multi-threading and the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m30s)

[question came up of when do you use a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m32s)

[parallel for each versus like a task](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m34s)

[whenn](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m36s)

[all um and the the answer there the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m37s)

[answer I gave and I'll predicate this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m42s)

[with I was talking to University](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m44s)

[students so some of it was based upon](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m45s)

[that's the level of audience that I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m48s)

[dealing with is uh parallel for each](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m50s)

[when you need to control the the max](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m53s)

[maximum degrees of of parallelization](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m55s)

[right that's the big reason to use the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h03m59s)

[parallel class now is when you want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m01s)

[access to this guy right here right I've](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m03s)

[got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m06s)

[stuff but I and I that I want you to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m07s)

[in parallel but I for whatever reason I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m10s)

[don't want to just like chew everything](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m13s)

[I want to constrain it in some way right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m15s)

[because you can do like a task when all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m18s)

[but if the the thing that's populating](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m21s)

[that list of task um can can grow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m23s)

[infinitely or unconstrained you can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m26s)

[easily thread pool starve yourself which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m29s)

[sometimes it's like you know what I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m32s)

[as many threads as I can get go go go go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m33s)

[go great right but it's it's worth](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m35s)

[having a a little think about which way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m37s)

[makes the most](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m40s)

[sense let's see so this is just building](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m42s)

[out the Delta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m45s)

[files](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m51s)

[okay that I'm not really concerned with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m53s)

[let's see here process failed exception](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h04m57s)

[this is literally just building this up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m00s)

[this is one thing I haven't quite](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m03s)

[figured out and we haven't really](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m04s)

[addressed yet is a lot of like our air](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m06s)

[messages are not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m08s)

[localized so that may be something that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m10s)

[gets addressed in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m13s)

[future this is also something I've](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m19s)

[noticed I don't know how I feel about](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m22s)

[this right string interpolation that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m24s)

[not needed just to make sure that your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m27s)

[Lines line up properly this technically](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m28s)

[the dollar sign's only needed on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m31s)

[first one not on the second and third](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m33s)

[ones but this is done so that your lines](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m34s)

[are nice nicely](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m36s)

[positioned sure one of those things it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m40s)

[like it's kind of a stylistic](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m43s)

[choice it's like H I don't care that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m46s)

[much on stylistic stuff okay file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m48s)

[deleted and more actually what this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m50s)

[means is file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m52s)

[moved so all of that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m54s)

[fine really wish the checking of this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h05m57s)

[box on GitHub didn't take a metric](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m00s)

[eternity that's always](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m03s)

[exciting come on GitHub I just I just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m06s)

[tick the Box this should not take](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m09s)

[forever I understand you've got to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m10s)

[all this like back and forth stuff okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m12s)

[so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m15s)

[formatting this moving that around great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m16s)

[fine lining up the files don't care](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m19s)

[again this is one of those cases where I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m22s)

[really would love it if when people are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m23s)

[doing all their AI stuff the AI I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m26s)

[is something that makes my code review](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m29s)

[faster right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m30s)

[like AI figure out that this isn't a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m33s)

[really a relevant change that I care](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m36s)

[about and group it off intelligently](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m38s)

[right like right now most code review](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m41s)

[tools group things by folder or file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m43s)

[which is fine in some cases but it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m47s)

[doesn't speed me up right we've got AI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m49s)

[now and I'm I really want something that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m51s)

[groups by a cat or of changes like put](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m53s)

[all of my you know my my git chunks that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h06m58s)

[are just namespace changes into a bucket](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m01s)

[right that way I can Mark viewed on that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m04s)

[bucket and say I don't care to review](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m06s)

[the names space changes right tell me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m08s)

[you give me a quick summary of what they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m10s)

[all are let me approve that and then](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m12s)

[let's move on like I I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m15s)

[care anymore like that's all I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m16s)

[right like I don't want to have to look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m20s)

[at a a a a bunch of changes that are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m21s)

[functionally the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m24s)

[same just to to give an approval on it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m26s)

[see and this is another clever trick](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m30s)

[right is building up multiple tasks and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m32s)

[then a waiting on them at the very end](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m36s)

[right so they both technically get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m40s)

[queued and start up ahead of time and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m41s)

[then we just wait on them one after the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m43s)

[other so then uh in theory a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m46s)

[stuff runs in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m49s)

[parallel that's clever right like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m52s)

[ear](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m56s)

[strings great great great and there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h07m57s)

[bunch of changes there but nothing I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m01s)

[care to look at closer it's either going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m02s)

[to work or it's going to not work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m04s)

[and I don't care that much either way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m07s)

[right and so like a lot of these things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m09s)

[were just pulled out of here so some of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m11s)

[those uh functions I mentioned earlier](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m14s)

[about like the the the weird naming for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m16s)

[the delta or the app image or portable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m18s)

[right like they show as ads only because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m20s)

[they were functions in a file that got](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m24s)

[cut and pasted into a new file and git](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m26s)

[can't pick that out that it's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m28s)

[technically just a move not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m31s)

[a not a delete and an ad which is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m33s)

[functionally what a move is right when](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m35s)

[you do a git move it's it's really is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m38s)

[just a delete and an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m40s)

[ad uh let's see this is literally just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m42s)

[Whit space new line changing so like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m45s)

[this like I why am I why am I why am I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m48s)

[having to review this it's not a it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m50s)

[not a good it doesn't make me feel good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m53s)

[GitHub](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m55s)

[make it feel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m56s)

[good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h08m58s)

[okay so release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m01s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m06s)

[publish uh let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m10s)

[see I'm wondering if we should rename](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m14s)

[this property](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m16s)

[to cuz if we're renaming the switch uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m22s)

[I'm guessing this was done to align with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m25s)

[the our change to the VPK pack command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m27s)

[but I'm wondering if if this property](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m31s)

[should be renamed to reflect this as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m34s)

[well might make more sense I we'll look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m38s)

[at the pack command and see what it is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m40s)

[because I feel like there should be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m43s)

[symmetry there I like symmetry symmetry](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m44s)

[makes me feel warm and fuzzy okay so the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m47s)

[URI exists still that didn't change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m50s)

[I'm I'm missing something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h09m58s)

[okay uh let's see default name don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m00s)

[care why did I leave this one here oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m05s)

[because I want to look at how this was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m08s)

[used that's what I wanted okay run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m09s)

[task is this is to get the task of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m14s)

[t comes with a name interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m20s)

[basic console](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m27s)

[okay progress console or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m34s)

[column run task does the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m38s)

[needful](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m43s)

[great using statement don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m44s)

[care uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m49s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m55s)

[this this changing of it here gives me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h10m57s)

[pause but we've already got the file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m03s)

[where the usage is because it feels like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m05s)

[an HTTP client Factory might be a better](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m08s)

[use](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m11s)

[case this is now up at the root](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m21s)

[oh this is in the test directory got it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m28s)

[okay don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m30s)

[care don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m31s)

[care not at the rout I can't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m34s)

[read uh let's see here what are we in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m38s)

[this is test just building out wh space](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m42s)

[changes there wh space changes there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m44s)

[don't care I think at some point I need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m49s)

[to make sure our editor conf fig I I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m51s)

[think kayin and I have different](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m53s)

[defaults for a number of columns before](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m54s)

[we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m56s)

[wrap which is it's probably not kayin](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h11m57s)

[and I have differences it's probably my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m00s)

[visual studio and wrer defaults have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m02s)

[differences and we should probably just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m05s)

[get an editor config and S okay we got](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m06s)

[that down to what is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m09s)

[that 12 files okay 12 things to look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m11s)

[and then a potential problem to solve](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m16s)

[we'll see why is this one open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m17s)

[okay okay let's go as spunk let's go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m21s)

[look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m28s)

[so velop Pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m30s)

[Flow so I'm kind of inclined to to fix](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m33s)

[this one right out the gate right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m36s)

[because this feels like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m38s)

[a an easy an easy fix right and so if I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m40s)

[go here and I go here and I just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m46s)

[do do I have a terminal open probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m50s)

[not but I got one here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h12m52s)

[so Source](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m05s)

[CD uh go away](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m09s)

[uh lib C sh I think is where it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m14s)

[is where where where is this where is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m19s)

[this script](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m21s)

[Source](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m25s)

[VPK okay so I'm already wrong DD](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m26s)

[ddac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m34s)

[flow there we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m36s)

[go flow API gen](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m37s)

[bat okay so that gets me to there that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m47s)

[gets me to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m50s)

[there do I have you open twice](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m51s)

[feels like I've got too many visual](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m55s)

[Studios open okay so now we should be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m56s)

[able to delete](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h13m59s)

[this okay and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m01s)

[that there that makes me feel a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m04s)

[better having](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m07s)

[a generated file with a dog. CS](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m08s)

[extension because that's that's slightly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m11s)

[more in line with where other things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m13s)

[land right and this is the nend swag is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m16s)

[probably the reason for Newton soft](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m20s)

[there is a way to avoid Newton soft but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m23s)

[I think we were already using it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m25s)

[elsewhere so it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m26s)

[like not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m28s)

[worth not worth mucking with it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m30s)

[okay uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m33s)

[great that handles that one so let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m36s)

[find where is that because I think we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m41s)

[left that script open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m44s)

[intentionally go back and look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m46s)

[that uh why did we not mark this one as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m50s)

[viewed now want should be marked as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m53s)

[viewed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m57s)

[uh the script where's the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h14m58s)

[script dear GitHub I want a way to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m03s)

[filter down to just the unviewed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m05s)

[items right because there's 97 files](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m09s)

[here GitHub be really great if I didn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m12s)

[have to look at them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m15s)

[all uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m18s)

[here simple](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m20s)

[Json this one right so this was the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m23s)

[change here uh okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m26s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m31s)

[uh see here we're going to change this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m34s)

[up to be rename](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m36s)

[generated file to have. g. CS](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m39s)

[extension M okay we'll do that and let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m45s)

[go go look here oh was it that we were](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m51s)

[looking at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h15m55s)

[here oh we can clean up a couple of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m00s)

[these why is client that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m02s)

[way low API extensions. CS let's just go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m06s)

[and look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m10s)

[so hey let me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m14s)

[type are you no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m17s)

[exception of null oh can I not use this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m20s)

[oh I can't use this because of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m24s)

[multi-targeting oh that is that dumb](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m26s)

[that dumb okay but at minimum we can do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m30s)

[the name of in here uh let's see add](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m34s)

[argument it to Raw](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m38s)

[string why okay why is there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m41s)

[not not an automatic thing here because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m45s)

[name of is a compiler implemented](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m49s)

[feature so it doesn't matter your TFM as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m51s)

[long as you're using the newer tooling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m54s)

[you can get away with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m56s)

[it uh let's see using statement can be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h16m58s)

[simplified](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m03s)

[yep clean that up use Simple using](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m07s)

[statement that will make that cleaner](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m10s)

[why is client have an underscore after](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m13s)

[it there reason we can't just do that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m18s)

[don't understand the underscore at the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m25s)

[end of client this feels like a re a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m26s)

[refactor rename that win](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m29s)

[arai there was probably something in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m33s)

[there at some point that caused](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m35s)

[issues dispose of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m39s)

[client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m48s)

[yeah those client where would dispose](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m51s)

[client dispose client is set to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h17m57s)

[false and then never set](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m00s)

[again right this looks like something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m05s)

[that may have been copied and pasted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m08s)

[from somewhere okay or there was an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m10s)

[extra level of refactoring here so we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m13s)

[don't need the finally which means we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m16s)

[don't need this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m18s)

[try which means this all gets cleaned up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m19s)

[okay that goes like that now why does](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m23s)

[request have an underscore at the end I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m26s)

[have a feeling oh I bet you I know what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m28s)

[happened this was probably copied from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m31s)

[the generated code and then brought in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m33s)

[oh that's probably what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m37s)

[happened that is probably what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m39s)

[happened that would make a lot more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m44s)

[sense the problem](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m50s)

[with you URI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m53s)

[Builder so this is a string Builder](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h18m57s)

[converting into a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m00s)

[URI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m02s)

[okay pair](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m04s)

[request got it okay so yeah this was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m08s)

[almost](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m11s)

[assuredly in here dispose response is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m12s)

[true and never set elsewhere so what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m15s)

[we're going to do is get rid of this do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m19s)

[using and we're going to get rid of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m22s)

[tri finally](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m24s)

[garbage bring that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m27s)

[in clean that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m30s)

[up just to make my life easier to look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m33s)

[at because this type of stuff screams](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m36s)

[uh screams generator and likely done in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m41s)

[the name](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m45s)

[of oh let's see content may be null here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m48s)

[is it possible for content to be null](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m51s)

[it is very possible for content to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h19m57s)

[null or is it we checking response](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m03s)

[codes this is safe probably safe enough](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m11s)

[because the only way this is null is if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m15s)

[my API has an air I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m17s)

[think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m20s)

[um no NOP not whatever I told you to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m23s)

[stop it stop it wrong button I'm I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m26s)

[wanted my refactor button uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m30s)

[response forward cancel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m35s)

[yep oh that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m43s)

[dirty read a string a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m45s)

[sync oh it only has a cancellation token](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m48s)

[in one of the me methods you can see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m52s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m56s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h20m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m02s)

[if net 60 or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m04s)

[greater uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m09s)

[else and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m19s)

[if uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m21s)

[this do this and then what you can do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m28s)

[here this drop down lets you toggle](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m32s)

[between the two things so now now we can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m34s)

[actually see the differences between](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m36s)

[them right which is a little bit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m38s)

[cleaner](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m45s)

[um trying to think of how the null case](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m48s)

[should be handled here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h21m51s)

[feels a little awkward what's oh this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m00s)

[one's the same issue here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m03s)

[right so this is actually I think the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m10s)

[exact same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m13s)

[code response content readus string a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m19s)

[sync](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m22s)

[hey C films yeah so was was looking at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m28s)

[the material design in zaml library a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m32s)

[little bit earlier](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m35s)

[so uh I do a little bit of material](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m37s)

[design and a couple different contexts](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m41s)

[um one as a WPF theming Library um and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m44s)

[recently I've been doing a bit with the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m48s)

[uh material. avalonia project because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m50s)

[it's kind of cool and and it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m53s)

[effectively a port of this to avalonia](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m55s)

[for the same idea uh and then velop Pac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h22m58s)

[a great question so vpac is a uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m01s)

[crossplatform](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m05s)

[installer as well as update](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m07s)

[framework uh and in this case in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m10s)

[particular so the the SDK and the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m12s)

[tooling is all free in open source but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m15s)

[there is a uh hosted service option that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m18s)

[is soon to be released and that is what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m23s)

[we are poking at a little bit here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m25s)

[trying](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m29s)

[to figure out the proper way to handle](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m30s)

[this um I think what we want to do is if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m33s)

[b. content is not null I think I just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m38s)

[want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m42s)

[to like if the content is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m43s)

[null I I think we just want to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m47s)

[nothing right empty file is probably the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m50s)

[expected outcome like like we get back a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m53s)

[response body that's null that's the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m56s)

[same as an empty response](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h23m59s)

[body and my server should never return](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m01s)

[back at 200 with an empty body](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m03s)

[so I think we're okay um this is also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m06s)

[one of the cases where we've written](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m10s)

[some extension methods and I may go try](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m11s)

[to hunt those down because those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m14s)

[should handle a bit of this okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m18s)

[download installer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m21s)

[latest this feels this feels really](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m28s)

[weird this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m31s)

[download](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m35s)

[installer latest two file async okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m38s)

[the only reason it's named the way it is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m41s)

[I was going to go change the name but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m43s)

[it's named that way because of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m45s)

[generated file boy I'm really tempted to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m48s)

[go change my Swagger page now to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m51s)

[this thing named differently](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m52s)

[that really makes me want to name things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m56s)

[differently we might have to update the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h24m58s)

[API to rename a method we may have to go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m00s)

[change the API API is functionally still](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m03s)

[private](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m06s)

[so like it's technically public but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m07s)

[functionally because we haven't released](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m11s)

[our hosted service yet it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m13s)

[is very open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m16s)

[download](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m24s)

[latest installer code okay so we're just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m26s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m29s)

[that just so because I want to get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m30s)

[through I want to get through this so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m35s)

[that that was this the bit there that I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m37s)

[wanted to to look at I think this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m39s)

[probably fine because at the end of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m42s)

[day this is just invoking a method where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m44s)

[we have this asset](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m47s)

[type right and this should be a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m49s)

[generated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m51s)

[enom yep](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m52s)

[um and it will pull](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m55s)

[down all of that information I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h25m57s)

[surprised you had to write this method](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m01s)

[versus the generated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m04s)

[one huh the fact that this needed to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m08s)

[written kind of makes me wonder if there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m12s)

[there was an issue with some of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m15s)

[generation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m16s)

[but me look because we did just generate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m19s)

[This Again download](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m21s)

[oh but this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m25s)

[download latest](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m27s)

[installer to file what does this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m31s)

[do does nwag not know what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m34s)

[a is the generated code really that oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m40s)

[so here's the code that he](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m44s)

[copied got it so this is this is what he](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m46s)

[copied is the nwag generation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m48s)

[code right but it doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m51s)

[sometimes n swag I get very annoyed with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m56s)

[you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h26m59s)

[um yeah I am wondering if there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m05s)

[is something that can be done on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m09s)

[generation side to eliminate the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m12s)

[necessity of this method we may we may](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m13s)

[go well actually hang](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m17s)

[on nwag file download](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m19s)

[endpoint is there is there not a way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m24s)

[to upload download file example that'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m30s)

[work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m34s)

[um was swash Buckle anyway okay file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m46s)

[download can be with a custom operation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m50s)

[filter let's see do you do you mostly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m52s)

[use c yeah so C is very much my bread](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m55s)

[and butter um but I I dabble in a few](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h27m58s)

[other areas as well so I would say C I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m03s)

[have expertise in but part of velop Pac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m08s)

[or a decent chunk of it is written in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m11s)

[Rust so I've uh started learning rust as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m12s)

[a means of trying to be useful in that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m17s)

[area as well um and then a handful of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m19s)

[Webby based stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m23s)

[like the website of velop Pac is done](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m24s)

[with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m27s)

[react so I have at least some level of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m28s)

[familiarity with doing react level](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m31s)

[development uh typescript Etc um a lot](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m34s)

[of my colleagues end up doing um view so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m38s)

[I have lots of resources for for view](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m43s)

[type stuff okay so we may just need to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m46s)

[decorate our download endpoint](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m50s)

[uh okay so it looks like the operation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h28m58s)

[being generated maybe what's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m01s)

[wrong and we might need to produce an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m03s)

[output type to do this I don't know that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m06s)

[I can directly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m10s)

[say what it's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m13s)

[be um this is upload I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m16s)

[download sound like it wants quotes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m20s)

[around](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m23s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m24s)

[blah is on my to-do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m26s)

[list blah blah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m30s)

[blah yeah there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m32s)

[something there's something maybe and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m35s)

[this is where Kaylin's comment on he's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m37s)

[getting a 400 on some of this stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m40s)

[gives me pause is I'm I don't trust that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m43s)

[nwag did this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m46s)

[properly uh okay so let's look at this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m47s)

[fancy console progress is this thing new](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m50s)

[I fancy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m55s)

[console](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h29m56s)

[progress okay so show me your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m00s)

[usages is there any reason why this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m04s)

[is like this gives me a bit of pause](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m11s)

[like what's the difference between this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m14s)

[and I progress of int right because I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m17s)

[progress of int is functionally the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m21s)

[thing I I think I think I'm willing to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m24s)

[bet that the the big difference is this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m28s)

[is easily implemented as a function](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m31s)

[whereas I progress is not maybe but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m33s)

[mean the thing is right there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m39s)

[progress](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m42s)

[class](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m44s)

[uh what is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m47s)

[it right so this this kind of oh that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m50s)

[no is is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m54s)

[that am I am I making this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m56s)

[up uh that is not the class I was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h30m59s)

[looking](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m02s)

[for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m03s)

[uh I progress what's your what's your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m05s)

[name space there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m08s)

[system so let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m11s)

[system progress int right so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m14s)

[there's this guy here that just wraps it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m18s)

[and maybe the idea was why would I wrap](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m22s)

[it when I could just pass this thing in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m24s)

[directly and it does capture the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m35s)

[synchronization context so maybe the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m37s)

[idea was to dodge that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m39s)

[maybe I'll have to ask feels a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m43s)

[weird uh let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m46s)

[see yeah so this one here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m50s)

[so the the idea here with um the logger](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h31m55s)

[warning is this looks like an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m00s)

[interpolated string but it's not um this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m02s)

[is used for structured logging so some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m06s)

[logging outputs will store the message](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m08s)

[format separate from the interpolated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m13s)

[message and that way you can say hey](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m16s)

[find me all of the log messages that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m19s)

[match this format without that way the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m21s)

[individual names don't necessarily get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m26s)

[in the way this can be incredibly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m28s)

[helpful because sometimes you have uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m29s)

[it's like hey I want to find this thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m32s)

[but I want to be able to query based](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m35s)

[upon the format and the parameter rather](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m36s)

[than just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m39s)

[on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m40s)

[um rather than just on the uh end result](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m44s)

[of the message right the the formatted](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m48s)

[string and so not all loging providers](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m51s)

[support it but the ones that do make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m55s)

[your life significantly easier okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h32m57s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m01s)

[here I fancy console](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m02s)

[progress and I'm curious why this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m06s)

[here implements](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m10s)

[it but the velop PAC flow service client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m12s)

[has two Constructors an logger and a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m16s)

[fancy console](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m19s)

[all right so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m25s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m26s)

[who this one here is doing logger and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m28s)

[logger uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m35s)

[okay figure8 false and this this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m38s)

[actually matters inside of the MS build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m41s)

[stuff so when you write an MS build task](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m43s)

[you have to be very cautious because if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m46s)

[you are executed inside a visual studio](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m48s)

[you are getting full framework if you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m50s)

[are executed with like a net CLI command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m52s)

[you're getting uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m56s)

[uh uh net six or above believe that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h33m59s)

[right um and so things like that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m04s)

[definitely start to make a difference I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m07s)

[I think this is a typo here right so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m10s)

[this was the thing we were going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m12s)

[check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m14s)

[before um cuz this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m18s)

[is suppress output false see this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m22s)

[bothers me log](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m25s)

[in got it okay that's fine so this this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m35s)

[handles what I think was the publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m40s)

[task issue that I had so let's go back](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m41s)

[to here uh where was publish task let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m44s)

[just search](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m49s)

[publish task this one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m51s)

[right I think that handles oh I want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m54s)

[look at the timeout too but we can we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m57s)

[can flatten this like how bad does it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h34m59s)

[make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m02s)

[it if I make you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m03s)

[a time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m06s)

[span](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m11s)

[um right if we do that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m20s)

[and then we do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m26s)

[time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m30s)

[ban right so if we if we just de with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m39s)

[that that now fixes this that fixes that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m43s)

[there's probably a handful of these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m47s)

[other ones that let's let's chase down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m49s)

[the the likely culprit here right CU a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m51s)

[few of these are going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m54s)

[be now problematic but I I think it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h35m56s)

[works](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m00s)

[better um I do want to check one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m02s)

[thing uh Ms build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m05s)

[uh must build task parameter time span I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m09s)

[I don't believe there is an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m14s)

[issue passing time spans from Ms build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m18s)

[task in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m22s)

[it should automatically bind because of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m26s)

[type converters I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m28s)

[believe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m31s)

[um task based class build engine blah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m40s)

[writing yeah register](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m55s)

[task require how I must build invokes a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h36m58s)

[task I'm looking for there's something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m04s)

[about how it binds parameters require](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m07s)

[task parameters to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m11s)

[set because it's functionally coming](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m14s)

[from an XML based](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m17s)

[convert from string with all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m29s)

[uh should just work because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m46s)

[of let's see where is it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m51s)

[because it is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m54s)

[convertible yes because time spans are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m56s)

[convertible okay so this should this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h37m59s)

[should be fine this should be fine as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m00s)

[long as we have done things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m03s)

[appropriately we should be all good is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m05s)

[that is that really the only place where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m08s)

[those things were being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m10s)

[set um I should check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m11s)

[here yeah there is no timeout being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m16s)

[specified inside of our task](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m19s)

[um I am wondering if there should be a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m24s)

[property for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m26s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m40s)

[um um I think there probably should be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m48s)

[one b pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m52s)

[HTTP](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m55s)

[timeout so the the basic pattern here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h38m57s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m02s)

[uh for Ms build properties just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m03s)

[magically wish themselves into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m07s)

[existence um at declaration time you can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m09s)

[almost think of them as name value pairs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m12s)

[in a lot of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m16s)

[cases but what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m17s)

[here whoop that's not how you T](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m20s)

[uh let's see 30 minutes 0 seconds so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m24s)

[because this string is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m28s)

[convertible](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m30s)

[oh is it convertible in all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m32s)

[culture eight culture](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m41s)

[conversions will it so change to hang](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m47s)

[on I might I might have to convince](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m52s)

[myself of the something change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m54s)

[type oh we might have to we might have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h39m59s)

[to test this the takes a format provider](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m01s)

[okay yeah let's before I get two carried](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m05s)

[away we get too carried](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m08s)

[away we might just have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m11s)

[to null Coles it and allow a null to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m15s)

[make it in that might be the other way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m18s)

[of doing this build succeeded okay great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m21s)

[um let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m24s)

[go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m26s)

[just need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m36s)

[a let's test class is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m37s)

[worthless okay I just need a test class](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m40s)

[there that's all I need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m43s)

[um actually let's go inside a vpack test](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m49s)

[I think that'll be lighter test and I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m51s)

[just need something quick and dirty new](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h40m53s)

[fact](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m00s)

[so public void can convert we're not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m02s)

[going to leave this test in here but I I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m06s)

[do want to test it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m07s)

[cultures yeah great okay uh you're wrong](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m18s)

[that's not what we going for string gets](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m24s)

[uh I want to see if I'm going to get bit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h41m29s)

[everywhere invalid](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m08s)

[cast I should have probably left myself](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m14s)

[some try](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m25s)

[catch inv valid cast exception right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m27s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m31s)

[this uh throw](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m33s)

[new exception fail to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m36s)

[convert and then we will I don't know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m41s)

[let's give myself an inner exception in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m44s)

[case I want to look at it all right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h42m46s)

[though yeah we can get away with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h45m04s)

[accessing the time span class can't we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h45m07s)

[yes yes we can okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h45m09s)

[so okay rather than hardcoding the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h45m13s)

[literately my sample](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h47m08s)

[pause this expected to round trip](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h47m15s)

[well we wrote a test let's use it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h47m34s)

[okay does this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h47m39s)

[work no of course not of course it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h47m44s)

[doesn't work because it's it's probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h47m46s)

[Chris uh but velop Pac is a uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m07s)

[crossplatform installer and updater](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m11s)

[technology so if you are interested in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m14s)

[playing around with it the the tooling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m17s)

[and SDK is all free open source course](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m19s)

[knock yourself](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m22s)

[out um it is great and awesome the thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m24s)

[that we are looking at is there is also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m28s)

[a technically unreleased uh right now um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m31s)

[hosting solution called velop Pac flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m36s)

[that we are working on and hoping to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m39s)

[release in the near future but this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m41s)

[for people who uh don't want to think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m44s)

[about things like signing and hosting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m46s)

[and just want somebody else to do it for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m48s)

[them uh if all you want to do is build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m50s)

[your stuff up and uh release and you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m54s)

[want to host it yourself on either your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m57s)

[own like S3 bucket GitHub releases](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h52m59s)

[whatever uh the the command line tooling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m02s)

[and SDK will handle everything for you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m06s)

[um and for people who are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m09s)

[interested right so there's kind of a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m12s)

[quick start for uh stuff that is in here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m14s)

[for current language support uh if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m18s)

[people and the language support here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m21s)

[specifically around the the updator](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m24s)

[framework if all you need is something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m26s)

[to deploy your app and you don't care](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m28s)

[about the the updater as much you can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m31s)

[kind of get away without it um but it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m34s)

[gets a little awkward because then you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m36s)

[have to kind of manage your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m38s)

[stuff um yourself yeah and it thank you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m41s)

[so I can't take a ton of credit for the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m46s)

[docs my partner um kin gets most of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m49s)

[credit but uh if you're interested like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m53s)

[they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m56s)

[are they are they are just right there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h53m57s)

[like it it's it's kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m00s)

[cool I will say too Chris I'm limiting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m02s)

[myself to one Mountain Dew tonight I've](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m05s)

[just increased](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m07s)

[my my cup size to appropriately account](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m09s)

[for my my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m12s)

[limit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m14s)

[uh yeah yeah volume see I I I'm only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m16s)

[having one Mountain Dew I've just made](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m20s)

[the size of my cup big enough to hold a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m23s)

[two liter so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m25s)

[details but yeah so that that is that is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m27s)

[the basic bits here and it for the most](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m30s)

[part it yeah one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m33s)

[bucket don't judge me but this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m35s)

[actually my second largest cup I do have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m37s)

[one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m41s)

[bigger the problem is is once you get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m41s)

[bigger the handle moves off the side and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m44s)

[the definition of cup becomes a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m46s)

[tentative at that point it the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m50s)

[between cup and jug like there there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m52s)

[debate to be had](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m55s)

[there so yeah but yeah no I was wrapping](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h54m57s)

[myself around the axle of passing time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m01s)

[spans in and and hating my myself and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m03s)

[not liking any of this stuff here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m06s)

[um but yeah oh c film the new language](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m10s)

[is called](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m13s)

[McFly uh let's see because one day](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m14s)

[question came to me which was what would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m17s)

[a coding language designed by me look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m18s)

[like uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m21s)

[time to adopt The Jug measurement for my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m23s)

[whiskey stream I mean that would make it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m24s)

[for an interesting stream Chris I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m26s)

[just don't overdo it that will be the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m30s)

[one the one rule or at least make it a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m34s)

[long](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m36s)

[stream if you spread it out long enough](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m37s)

[you're probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m39s)

[fine okay so there's the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m42s)

[solution I have to pass it as a string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m46s)

[and parse it myself yuck yuck yuck yuck](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m48s)

[yuck yuck yuck Yu Yu yuck yuck Yu yuck](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m51s)

[yuck okay if I parse it as a if I parse](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m53s)

[it can I get away with okay so now now](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m56s)

[the question is can I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h55m59s)

[just cultures are hard I don't like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m04s)

[cultures I would actually die I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m12s)

[currently getting drunk off of One mic](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m14s)

[Ultra yeah yeah absolutely abolutely](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m19s)

[uh C films if you've got a link feel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m25s)

[free to drop it in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m27s)

[chat okay so I can get away with this as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m30s)

[long as I pass the parameters a string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m32s)

[and then I parse it myself yuck yuck](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m35s)

[yuck I hate this I hate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m37s)

[this yeah see films feel free to drop it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m43s)

[like I've seen several people go through](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m45s)

[and build out their own programming](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m47s)

[languages and like one if you're doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m49s)

[it professionally to try to say oo I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m53s)

[going to build the next great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m55s)

[programming language like that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m56s)

[significantly hard but as a learning](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h56m58s)

[experience especially for like building](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m00s)

[uh compilers and understanding how they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m03s)

[work it's a really great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m05s)

[exercise um not for the faint of heart](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m07s)

[but it is a really great exercise](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m11s)

[there's a wonderful um YouTube series uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m13s)

[by emo uh what is it emo landworth from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m17s)

[Microsoft where he goes through and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m20s)

[rebuilds uh a compiler from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m23s)

[scratch as an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m26s)

[emphasize uh to doing it oh yeah the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m28s)

[at the the at prefix in as a variable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m33s)

[name in C is a total hack when you want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m36s)

[to name a variable that matches a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m38s)

[keyword um in general this is a test I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m40s)

[about to delete not something that I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m44s)

[going to keep but in general if you put](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m45s)

[an at in front of a variable name um it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m47s)

[probably means you named your variable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m50s)

[wrong and you should fix it but in this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m51s)

[case I was just trying to prove to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m54s)

[myself that I could make a string parse](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m56s)

[properly all the way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h57m58s)

[through oh cool thank you C film I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m01s)

[gonna put this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m03s)

[on my thing and I'll take a look because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m06s)

[yeah it is it is a very interesting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m10s)

[thing even building a simple parser for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m12s)

[a lot of stuff is uh remarkably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m14s)

[difficult at one of the University](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m17s)

[classes that uh we teach we used to give](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m19s)

[our students an assignment where it was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m22s)

[basically build a small like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m25s)

[mathematical parser where it was just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m26s)

[like Implement addition and subtraction](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m28s)

[not even](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m30s)

[that difficult but yeah it it it makes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m31s)

[it it makes it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m36s)

[hard uh let's see string is better than](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m37s)

[test one two three that is true that is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m40s)

[true sometimes sometimes a poor name is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m41s)

[well is that true](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m45s)

[yeah a name like this when it when it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m49s)

[legit timately as a stram pro parse is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m51s)

[there and I think that's the only reason](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m54s)

[they leave the escape hatch is because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m55s)

[in some generic cases maybe the keyword](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h58m57s)

[is the right variable name](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m01s)

[but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m04s)

[yeah yeah test one two3 would be a lot](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m07s)

[worse so okay but what this tells me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m10s)

[though is I can actually pass through a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m13s)

[timeout like this however what that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m16s)

[means is I have to come down here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m20s)

[and unlike my Pat command I have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m22s)

[do uh timeout thank you Auto code button](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m26s)

[and then down here I want to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m31s)

[timeout thank you and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m34s)

[I'm you know what I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m37s)

[bother to split them one variable to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m39s)

[rule them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m41s)

[all but it does mean that I need to on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m42s)

[my pack and publish task make them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m45s)

[strings and then parse them because yuck](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m48s)

[yuck yuck yuck yuck](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m51s)

[yuck I just I don't like it when my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m54s)

[plans don't come](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m56s)

[together oh it's not even exposed here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=01h59m59s)

[is it oh it's not even](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m02s)

[exposed sweet that'll make my life even](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m05s)

[better public](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m08s)

[string time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m11s)

[out get set and then we're just going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m13s)

[need to get it into the appropriate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m16s)

[options](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m17s)

[variable um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m19s)

[yeah there's some some people I've seen](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m25s)

[on like the Single Character variable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m27s)

[names like things like I and a for Loop](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m29s)

[are like they're generally accepted as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m33s)

[normal because that's what people expect](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m36s)

[the iterator variable name to be and it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m39s)

[works](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m41s)

[right uh let's see string timeout and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m42s)

[this is where we're going to have to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m46s)

[some some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m47s)

[work uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m50s)

[time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m54s)

[span timeout gets let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m56s)

[see uh you're so close copilot you're so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h00m59s)

[close uh let's see here and I'm actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m08s)

[wondering if I should do something is it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m10s)

[worth dealing like no you should get a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m12s)

[parse exception if you give it a bad](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m16s)

[value um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m19s)

[uh why so many columns why so many](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m26s)

[members in that class oh yeah so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m29s)

[one here so this is a Ms build task and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m32s)

[the only so it has to have a single](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m36s)

[public property for every parameter you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m41s)

[need to pass into it so this is actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m43s)

[a class being consumed by the build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m47s)

[system itself so the invoking it is this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m49s)

[and the only reason it has all of these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m54s)

[parameters most of these parameters the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m56s)

[average human is never going to touch or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h01m59s)

[see because I'm defaulting the variables](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m01s)

[ahead of time to reasonable defaults but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m05s)

[I need them to be variables so that if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m08s)

[somebody consuming my build task wants](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m11s)

[to change one of the defaults they have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m15s)

[an injection point to do so so it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m17s)

[really only there as a customize thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m19s)

[in general this level of parameters is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m22s)

[uh insane mode so yeah generally don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m26s)

[ever do this this is a bad idea um it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m31s)

[horrible in fact um so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m36s)

[yeah so completely agree in general this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m41s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m44s)

[a not great option um let's see two s](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m45s)

[pack options but yeah this this is this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m49s)

[is a a level of craziness like so for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m52s)

[example if we back up here right and we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m55s)

[do the the quick start right so you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h02m59s)

[build an app with a velop Pac right you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m02s)

[add in a couple lines to to to make it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m07s)

[to make it actually work so you have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m10s)

[bootstrap the library inside your app to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m11s)

[get it going and then you put codes kind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m13s)

[of like this wherever you want to have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m17s)

[the updating happening right it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m19s)

[intentionally broken into three calls we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m22s)

[the sample shows them all in one method](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m24s)

[but maybe you break them up because you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m26s)

[want to see you know show the user that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m27s)

[there's an update let them view the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m30s)

[update then let them download it and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m31s)

[install it when they want to right maybe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m33s)

[there's user interaction between each of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m34s)

[these steps whatever right we leave it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m36s)

[open for you to to decide how you want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m38s)

[to do but then to actually produce the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m40s)

[installer right you have to compile your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m42s)

[app and this is just the nety way of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m44s)

[building an app that's ready for being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m47s)

[released right and then you build the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m50s)

[installer with VPK pack to be able to go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m52s)

[through and and publish it out the thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m55s)

[is is this is two](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m57s)

[steps and net developers we are lazy we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h03m59s)

[don't like two-steps and so there is a a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m03s)

[package here one that is still in beta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m07s)

[and that's what's being built out here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m11s)

[called um velop Pac build and it injects](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m13s)

[into your build process such that when](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m16s)

[you run net publish it will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m19s)

[automatically invoke VPK pack for you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m22s)

[that way the the process for building](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m26s)

[your installers is literally just run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m29s)

[the same net publish command that you do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m31s)

[today to to publish your app and in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m33s)

[addition to your app being built out for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m36s)

[you you also end up with an installer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m38s)

[sitting right there which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m40s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m42s)

[because why why type two commands on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m44s)

[command line when I can do it in one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m47s)

[command and save myself a L of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m49s)

[effort so and then things like version](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m52s)

[and app ID that's part of why all those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m55s)

[variables exist is because people are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m57s)

[going to want to you know specify the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h04m59s)

[version of their application their app](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m01s)

[ID those types of things all kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m03s)

[need to be variabledefinitionkey](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m12s)

[straightforward and I hope others](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m22s)

[agree uh okay so this guy here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m24s)

[generating um I don't know how well this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m28s)

[is going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m31s)

[to I don't know how well it's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m33s)

[play](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m36s)

[with so this is leveraging a um a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m39s)

[compile time mapping I'm actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m43s)

[surprised it's not giving](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m45s)

[me crap about the type mismatch but I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m48s)

[also realizing it might not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m52s)

[have Windows pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h05m56s)

[options](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m10s)

[aha so if I go all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m14s)

[waya that's probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m19s)

[why I bet you I get bit when I do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m26s)

[this I bet you get bit because I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m35s)

[remember how the nice part is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m37s)

[mapping stuff is compile time based so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m39s)

[it will yell at me at compile time if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m41s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m43s)

[problem uh is WPF alive oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m44s)

[boy oh boy oh boy oh boy Bo um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m49s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m53s)

[so at the Microsoft build conference](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m57s)

[this last April one of the the yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h06m59s)

[one of the key messages Microsoft put](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m03s)

[forward is we are not abandoning WPF](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m05s)

[partly because Visual Studio yeah a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m08s)

[decent chunk of this is still WPF so but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m10s)

[yes know so yeah I'm joking yeah don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m13s)

[worry I like you hit on a sweet spot for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m17s)

[me I I still love my WPF very near and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m20s)

[dear to my heart I will say if given my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m24s)

[choices I think avalonia is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m27s)

[my is probably where I would jump to for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m31s)

[newer stuff like I really like it it for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m34s)

[somebody like me with a a big WPF](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m38s)

[background it feels](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m41s)

[nice um it just feels really](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m44s)

[nice uh pack command pack option oh so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m48s)

[only put it on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m52s)

[one uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m54s)

[public uh time span](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h07m57s)

[timeout so that should get me past that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m01s)

[compiler um yeah the the big](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m05s)

[disadvantage I see with avalonia is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m09s)

[there's there's not as M](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m11s)

[like sometimes you you just have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m14s)

[write stuff yourself whereas wpf's got](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m16s)

[you know coming up on three decades no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m19s)

[that's okay see compile time mapping](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m55s)

[helps login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h08m58s)

[command that one though I think I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m01s)

[actually okay with I think I'm actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m03s)

[okay with that that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m07s)

[mapping](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m11s)

[um yeah cuz some of the some of these we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m17s)

[may legitimately](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m19s)

[not not like the login one I don't want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m22s)

[to Timeout on because that you you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m25s)

[call back so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m36s)

[it's okay does this actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m39s)

[map is not actually going to map](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m42s)

[the the timeout despite the fact that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m47s)

[the time out exist there now if I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m51s)

[do that we like I'm a I'm a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h09m54s)

[on this at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m01s)

[all because it knows in so this uh this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m04s)

[options mapper is kind of convenient oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m10s)

[rerun generator oh look at that I like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m13s)

[why does it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m26s)

[not oh we can make this slightly more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m29s)

[efficient hey Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h10m32s)

[suggestions](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m00s)

[um I don't like how it makes a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m02s)

[suggestion then doesn't give me an auto](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m05s)

[code option for it come on Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m07s)

[do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m10s)

[better](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m11s)

[uh oh you can't oh this is so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m14s)

[dumb it's possible](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m18s)

[but only in certain Frameworks isn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m22s)

[it you string contains Char instead of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m26s)

[string contains](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m30s)

[string but I willing to bet that that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m32s)

[doesn't exist like this will probably be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m35s)

[fine in the net 6 world and probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m37s)

[suck in the others](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m41s)

[what yeah string contains but then this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m45s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m48s)

[exist in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m49s)

[472 hate when it does that yeah so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m52s)

[here's the here's the dirty trick right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m56s)

[so if you expand this off you'll note](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h11m58s)

[right net 472 but I've got two target](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m01s)

[Frameworks right so I've got 472 and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m05s)

[60 so this code is great but only if we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m09s)

[pound if for 60 and I'm way too lazy to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m13s)

[do that for a minor performance](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m16s)

[optimization](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m18s)

[um and that's probably why](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m23s)

[the um the analyzer is flagging it and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m28s)

[not giving me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m32s)

[suggestions this guy here is really not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m36s)

[going to convert this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m40s)

[he oh timeout.](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m42s)

[value there it did it but if I change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m45s)

[this to string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m50s)

[Will You Still Will You Still](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m52s)

[convert or will you just silently ignore](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m55s)

[it and say I don't know what you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m57s)

[talking](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h12m59s)

[about map to time span oh it knows how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m00s)

[to map to time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m03s)

[spans no it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m08s)

[doesn't no it doesn't so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m11s)

[believe what we can do though is we can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m15s)

[override that function where was that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m18s)

[just saw it a moment](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m22s)

[ago there is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m24s)

[a mapping function](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m26s)

[in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m30s)

[specify](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m37s)

[um where is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m40s)

[private](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m51s)

[static time span bring to time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h13m53s)

[span this is a case where maybe at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m00s)

[string makes more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m03s)

[sense right and now I think if we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m05s)

[rebuild and force this thing to go then](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m08s)

[it'll figure out how to properly map](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m11s)

[this thing for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m13s)

[me it it' be really cool if it just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m15s)

[mapped this properly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m17s)

[oh this is not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m30s)

[right your run generator are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m33s)

[you going to do what I would like might](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m36s)

[have to go look up the docks for this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m40s)

[because I know there's string to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m41s)

[directory info see this one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m43s)

[knew how to map it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m47s)

[oh it's here where I probably need to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m52s)

[ITA pass operations mapper string to rid](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h14m56s)

[yeah how did you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m01s)

[know where is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m03s)

[this task operations mapper inside the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m06s)

[build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m09s)

[project](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m11s)

[okay this is the one that needs to have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m14s)

[the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m17s)

[like I know there's I know there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m21s)

[magical thing it bothers me that the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m22s)

[tooling doesn't actually understand how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m25s)

[to do this but you know that's fine](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m27s)

[that's fine that's fine it's fine yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m29s)

[remember unused it's not unused it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m33s)

[because you aren't smart enough to look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m35s)

[at the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m37s)

[generator and know that it's actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m38s)

[used inside of generated code it may not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m40s)

[be used inside of my code but the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m42s)

[generator uses](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m44s)

[it okay so now if we look if string to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m47s)

[time span huzzah right it now invokes my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m51s)

[function okay that's all I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m54s)

[wanted that is all I wanted so it checks](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h15m57s)

[if it's null if it's non null it'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m01s)

[invoke my function hurrah okay so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m03s)

[gets me to there that should do the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m07s)

[thing for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m09s)

[OSX uh if I add it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m12s)

[into this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m15s)

[guy right so I put it on the bottom here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m18s)

[of that nature so I just need to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m23s)

[sure I propagate it through to the OSX](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m25s)

[options and then we do the same thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m34s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m36s)

[Linux go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m38s)

[Linux and then we do there kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m41s)

[wondering if that's the right name for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m45s)

[it but whatever we'll let that guy run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m46s)

[and then we'll just quickly double check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m48s)

[it and then we should be able to check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m50s)

[in on the runner which will receive set](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m53s)

[options uh let's see what is your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m57s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h16m59s)

[here uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m01s)

[OSX oh I see yeah yeah yeah I didn't add](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m08s)

[it in yet that's why it doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m11s)

[public uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m16s)

[some people might tap on a map in their](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m21s)

[lap somebody did a wrap about a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m23s)

[map I think my brain is a a little uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m26s)

[tired on the tongue](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m31s)

[twister uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m32s)

[here so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m34s)

[these I think I actually want the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m40s)

[T I may want to move it all the way down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m45s)

[actually let me back up on the window](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m48s)

[Windows command because there is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m50s)

[common Base Class](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m52s)

[here because I think this guy here I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m54s)

[like I added the option but it didn't it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h17m57s)

[didn't add one for the CLI invocation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m01s)

[because even though we're adding this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m03s)

[for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m05s)

[the um the MS build step it is something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m07s)

[that in theory other people may want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m11s)

[leverage down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m16s)

[so let's put a CLI option on it as well](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m19s)

[that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m22s)

[way time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m28s)

[span this becomes timeout](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m30s)

[option](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m34s)

[sheesh um and then down here we go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m37s)

[timeout option](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m41s)

[gets uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m48s)

[uh time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m52s)

[out oh this is on the pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h18m56s)

[command on the pat](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m05s)

[command what is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m11s)

[actual step here because we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m15s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m24s)

[when you run VPK](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m26s)

[p and you specify a timeout is it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m29s)

[obvious what that timeout is actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m33s)

[used for because the timeout is not for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m35s)

[the pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m37s)

[operation I may need to back off of what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m39s)

[I was thinking because the whole point](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m42s)

[in doing this was to expose](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m44s)

[out look at this here real quick uh uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m48s)

[we're going to keep that because that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m51s)

[here the whole point of doing this was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m52s)

[to expose out the timeout](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m54s)

[operation because I was a little unhappy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h19m57s)

[with the timeout being a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m00s)

[double because that didn't make a lot of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m05s)

[sense and so we pushed it through here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m08s)

[and we made the timeout](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m11s)

[here which that makes sense to me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m16s)

[this makes sense to me because when you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m21s)

[are running these on a pipeline you will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m23s)

[need an injection Point](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m26s)

[here but I am](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m28s)

[not sure that it actually makes sense on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m31s)

[the pack it makes good sense on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m35s)

[publish because you're actually pushing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m38s)

[up to where that needs to go but on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m41s)

[pack itself you're you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m44s)

[not okay so let's let's let's back off](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m47s)

[on a few things here so pack ditch](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m50s)

[because that doesn't make as nearly as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m55s)

[much sense](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h20m58s)

[so I don't think I want this because I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m02s)

[actually want that to fail out I do want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m06s)

[the publish targets the service client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m09s)

[here I do want to leave it as a time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m12s)

[span so that we want to keep I do want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m14s)

[to leave this as a Time SP band that I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m17s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m21s)

[keep the Linux pack options I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m22s)

[think I want to expose it all the way up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m26s)

[through the CLI because it doesn't make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m27s)

[nearly as much sense there and I think I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m30s)

[want to dial it out of the pat command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m33s)

[and only leave it in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m36s)

[publish the login the timeout for that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m39s)

[makes sense to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m42s)

[keep um this is the test that we want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m44s)

[throw away because we don't need it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m47s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m49s)

[um we want to keep our targets file we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m51s)

[want to keep our publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m53s)

[task okay so that where does that leave](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m55s)

[me yes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h21m58s)

[doll does that leave me in a compiling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m04s)

[State don't know it if it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m07s)

[does don't know if it does](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m10s)

[hey look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m21s)

[that my big head's in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m22s)

[way I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m28s)

[win okay so that makes a little bit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m30s)

[better and then over on our targets](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m35s)

[we're just going to drop timeout off of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m40s)

[the pack and leave Timeout on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m42s)

[publish that leaves timeout needing to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m45s)

[be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m49s)

[a parameter](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m50s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m55s)

[um oh I'm doubling it up because there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h22m58s)

[that okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m02s)

[great that works and that compiles](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m04s)

[so drop that out of there okay so let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m10s)

[just let's just check these guys real](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m13s)

[quick so if we do logger we're fixing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m16s)

[the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m20s)

[the parameter](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m21s)

[name here we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m23s)

[are changing timeout to be a string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m27s)

[because timeout really can't be a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m31s)

[double](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m35s)

[um actually wait for live might not be a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m39s)

[hang on wait for live isn't being pushed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m43s)

[through here I hang on can you even do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m46s)

[where did the where did my docks](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m51s)

[go task parameter string bu string and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m55s)

[buol are the only two Primitives that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h23m59s)

[are valid everything else is a change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m02s)

[type okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m06s)

[uh see here so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m13s)

[works but that isn't exposed here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m17s)

[here so we should expose it up here uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m25s)

[fellow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m27s)

[pack wait for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m29s)

[live sure how much I like that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m32s)

[name](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m35s)

[condition really co-pilot you're not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m37s)

[going to not going to help me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m40s)

[um then we're going to do this this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m48s)

[this oh uh and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m52s)

[do that and then we're going to come](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m56s)

[down here and we're going to add it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h24m59s)

[here wait](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m02s)

[for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m04s)

[live that way it passes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m06s)

[through](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m10s)

[okay we default the false that aligns](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m13s)

[with the existing one but it leaves it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m16s)

[in a state where somebody could specify](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m18s)

[that property in their CSR in order to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m20s)

[get it done like there's a there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m23s)

[heck of a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m25s)

[timing gymnastics being done here which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m27s)

[is why this property group is defined](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m29s)

[inside the target rather than up here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m31s)

[because this allows somebody to specify](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m34s)

[these properties inside of the CSR for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m37s)

[their project and because we only assign](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m39s)

[these defaults when the values are empty](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m42s)

[it leaves it open for if people don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m45s)

[in if they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m49s)

[uh do set them we'll take theirs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m53s)

[instead so it it leaves for some nice](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h25m57s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m29s)

[is must build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m31s)

[uh publish task to well how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m35s)

[about changing time span to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m40s)

[or time out to time span wow that was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m45s)

[not supposed to be that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m50s)

[hard uh updating](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m53s)

[publish task to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h26m57s)

[have uh parameters for the timeout and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m01s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m06s)

[for live per](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m08s)

[metrix there is currently a fun bug in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m13s)

[the velop PAC build nougat package um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m16s)

[um that at some point I am going to go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m21s)

[through and fix is it'll work fine if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m23s)

[you run net publish from the command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m25s)

[line but fails inside of visual studio](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m27s)

[and the difference is because the visual](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m29s)

[studio version of net is NET Framework](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m31s)

[NET Framework expects signed dlls which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m34s)

[aren't a thing in net uh 5 and greater I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m37s)

[think and so we get bit left and right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m43s)

[okay so which one of you lovely people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m47s)

[was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m51s)

[I did I close my PR no there we go good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m52s)

[okay so we looked at that that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m57s)

[fine did not look at that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h27m59s)

[yet see we did check publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m02s)

[task um I left one of these open because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m06s)

[I wanted to look at the time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m10s)

[span and the base URI um let's look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m14s)

[let's take a brief Gander this one I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m20s)

[think we answered our question for but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m23s)

[kind of want to go look and see why I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m25s)

[can't use the newer Syntax for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m26s)

[this um and it could just be yeah new](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m29s)

[syntax allowed so latest C you don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m32s)

[have to do new list anymore you can just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m36s)

[double square brace](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m37s)

[um why does this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m41s)

[why does this have nullable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m51s)

[disable this is in velop at core which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m53s)

[has nullable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m56s)

[enabled why are we disabling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h28m57s)

[this I think we do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m00s)

[this this so I have a firm belief that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m06s)

[if it's serializable it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m10s)

[nullable unless you can make a strong](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m12s)

[claim as to why it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m14s)

[not and I have a I have a strange](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m16s)

[feeling the reason it's set this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m18s)

[way is because if we turn on nullability](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m22s)

[then things like this start](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m25s)

[becoming](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m27s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m30s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m32s)

[um like now with nullability turned on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m34s)

[we can see that these things are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m36s)

[expected to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m38s)

[non-null and the code anticipates them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m39s)

[being non-null this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m42s)

[one also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m44s)

[tracks but you can see here right this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m46s)

[is this is der serializing but there's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m49s)

[nothing stopping the file from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m51s)

[deserializing into this build assets and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m53s)

[The Returned value being itself null](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m56s)

[right this is expecting the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h29m59s)

[deserialization to succeed and that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m01s)

[not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m03s)

[guaranteed right on an invalid file you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m04s)

[could certainly get a null back for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m08s)

[example an empty file you will get a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m09s)

[null which is fine except for it's no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m12s)

[it's no longer handling that that case](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m16s)

[very nicely](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m19s)

[um get file path so half of these things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m22s)

[are inside of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m26s)

[here half of these things are outside](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m27s)

[and half of these things are like every](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m30s)

[single one of these is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m32s)

[innumerable so we're going to change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m33s)

[this up all right so get file paths](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m35s)

[compiles just fine as an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m37s)

[innumerable um if relative file names](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m40s)

[is file names](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m48s)

[right we're going to just we'll n check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m52s)

[it so that handles that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m54s)

[guy right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h30m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m01s)

[and output dur is not well here we'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m03s)

[just do this output D there no check](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m08s)

[them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m13s)

[both uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m14s)

[return see this is why the new syntax is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m17s)

[cool no longer need to think about the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m20s)

[weird empty list um what are you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m22s)

[actually trying to do here collection](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m25s)

[expression uh I don't know I think the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m28s)

[two list is just as readable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m30s)

[here okay and I'm going to just do this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m33s)

[because this makes me feel happy when](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m36s)

[there's nice symmetry across the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m39s)

[lines](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m43s)

[okay um I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m46s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m49s)

[is we're just going to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m50s)

[this if a null comes back we'll get an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m53s)

[empty object and then we'll populate it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h31m56s)

[as an empty object will have an empty](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m00s)

[array here and this will return](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m01s)

[back](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m04s)

[um let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m06s)

[do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m09s)

[handling liability](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m11s)

[on I realize we've done all of this and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m15s)

[we haven't actually addressed the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m17s)

[underlying problem yet](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m18s)

[I just got too many things I want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m21s)

[fix sometimes sometimes you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m23s)

[can't can't see the uh the trees through](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m26s)

[the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m29s)

[um but this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m53s)

[here is should with nullable annotation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h32m58s)

[context are you not nullable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h33m02s)

[that something has nullable disables](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h33m27s)

[still on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h33m30s)

[it like for example that shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h33m33s)

[necessary am I missing something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h33m42s)

[having trouble with it is the velop pack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m19s)

[test so if we go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m21s)

[here velop pack test look at that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m23s)

[obvious that little arrow right there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m31s)

[means file link so this file is being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m34s)

[linked in to the test project if we look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m38s)

[here right we will find a reference in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h35m41s)

[commit okay then that all of this just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m17s)

[to handle some code feedback so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m20s)

[handles that 92 out of 97 see cooking](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m23s)

[check this box](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m33s)

[okay log in options this one I wanted to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m36s)

[look at because of the base](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m39s)

[class this one made me wonder if login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m41s)

[is is dropping the ability to set a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m45s)

[service URL](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m48s)

[so I wanted to look here and I wanted to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m50s)

[grab the VPK flow login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m54s)

[command flow login command do you have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h37m57s)

[the ability to set a base URL you do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m02s)

[okay so given](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m10s)

[that what I am looking for is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m13s)

[the login command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m17s)

[Runner that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m21s)

[thing this gets the O login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m24s)

[options which has the base](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m28s)

[vpac flow login options where are you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m39s)

[used maybe I'm just confuse as to where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m42s)

[this class](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m44s)

[oh you just get used](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m53s)

[here oh okay that's probably okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h38m58s)

[then okay so that's fine that's that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m06s)

[okay that is totally fine that is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m09s)

[totally fine I just misunderstood the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m11s)

[class okay we're good we are good vop](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m13s)

[plaque flow service okay so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m17s)

[here this is where the bug is likely](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m20s)

[located I need right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m22s)

[file okay so this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m27s)

[where kin indicated he was getting a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m30s)

[this to to track it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m36s)

[down this one here has several calls](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m38s)

[just to get the base URL and I'm a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m42s)

[little confused as to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m45s)

[why that is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m47s)

[because this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m54s)

[grabs this here but I don't think you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h39m59s)

[ever going to have a base URL](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m02s)

[here what where where does this get set](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m05s)

[to it will have one because of how n](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m10s)

[no no one likes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m19s)

[you okay so all of that just to get this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m23s)

[is there no better way of getting this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m28s)

[this do we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m38s)

[have I is that the only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m41s)

[one really okay so maybe this is less of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m47s)

[a problem than I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m51s)

[thought why does this one need it so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m54s)

[this is doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h40m57s)

[this as an absolute](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m02s)

[fallback just for the logging](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m07s)

[information where did there's got to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m14s)

[another call down here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m19s)

[lower um let's see get off](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m21s)

[configuration authorization hmac acquire](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m25s)

[silently because this this is making a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m30s)

[big assumption here on how this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m33s)

[actually going to end up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m36s)

[working because the only time that I I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m43s)

[worried that this is actually the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m47s)

[General](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m49s)

[case um because most of the time people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m50s)

[aren't going to be specifying a base URL](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m53s)

[they're just going to use the public one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m55s)

[and so we knew up this entire service](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m56s)

[thing getting the HTTP client the flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h41m59s)

[API client all of that stuff just to R](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m02s)

[return a string which is real](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m05s)

[Overkill or something that could just be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m11s)

[a constant because the string that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m13s)

[being populated into the generated code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m16s)

[is known at compile](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m19s)

[of irky](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m27s)

[jerkiness um acquire silently because do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m30s)

[do we even use these Scopes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m34s)

[accounts because it's all about this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m40s)

[public](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m42s)

[client this guy here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m43s)

[um where where do we actually query CU I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m47s)

[I kind of want to change it so that we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m51s)

[pass this guy in is it off configuration](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m53s)

[that makes the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m55s)

[call yeah so here this guy here I kind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h42m56s)

[of feel like this should take in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m00s)

[flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m02s)

[API all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m06s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m08s)

[um so make the collar specify](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m10s)

[it rather than retrieving it internally](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m14s)

[that way we don't have to get and throw](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m16s)

[away get and throw](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m18s)

[away um let's see flow API client get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m21s)

[flow because uh in any one of these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m26s)

[situations I'd much prefer if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m29s)

[the if we only ever called get flow API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m34s)

[once because then it doesn't bother me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m38s)

[nearly as bad if we're only retrieving](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m39s)

[one of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m42s)

[these right like that feels a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m46s)

[better](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m48s)

[um it does mean that I push a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m51s)

[more burden onto the collar but that I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m54s)

[think is better because I would rather](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m56s)

[that burden of retrieving the client be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m57s)

[done at the public API rather than down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h43m59s)

[inside the private](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m02s)

[one I think that makes me feel a little](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m09s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m11s)

[better right though get profile async is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m13s)

[only invoked from here and it can take](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m16s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m19s)

[client right and get profile is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m21s)

[effectively a private method so we are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m25s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m28s)

[do low API client because that client is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m29s)

[kind of expensive to build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m33s)

[up it' be nice to not uh abuse it too](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m37s)

[badly okay so let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m42s)

[let's flatten this guy up a little bit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m46s)

[um where did that get profile](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m52s)

[go okay let's bring this sucker down and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h44m57s)

[let's start I I kind of want to look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m01s)

[some of these get flow API ones right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m03s)

[like some of these I want to limit how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m04s)

[many calls there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m07s)

[are that's fine the first two are fine](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m09s)

[noticing a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m14s)

[pattern download latest release this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m15s)

[only has one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m18s)

[invocation because HTTP client itself](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m22s)

[is rad](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m27s)

[safe and I'm just looking to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m30s)

[see if there is a place up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m33s)

[here upload latest releases is this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m36s)

[invoked the task and the runner so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m40s)

[needs to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m43s)

[public um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m45s)

[just trying to look execute progress a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h45m49s)

[Lambda that comes in here process report](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m07s)

[create channel if not existing see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m11s)

[there's a there's a bunch of these in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m14s)

[here where it's they're all going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m15s)

[call get flow client and this I think I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m17s)

[want to cut off right so I don't like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m21s)

[this I want to go blow API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m25s)

[client and then the caller now has to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m30s)

[suffer creating the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m33s)

[thing but I'm kind of okay with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m37s)

[this because now I can do this and we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m42s)

[can avoid the the creation of a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m47s)

[these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m50s)

[things oh you know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m52s)

[what let me just check and make sure is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m55s)

[this is the generated one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h46m59s)

[from I just want to check and see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m08s)

[because I don't know I think these are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m11s)

[all fine HTTP client itself is I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m14s)

[know if the n swag client itself is but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m18s)

[I can't imagine there's not enough](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m21s)

[state to cause cross threading problems](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m24s)

[unless you let something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m27s)

[dispose right you can't change settings](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m29s)

[after the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m32s)

[fact this guy here is using system. lazy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m39s)

[but it is intentionally using thread](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m43s)

[safe on it so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m45s)

[think we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m50s)

[good okay just want to just J just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m52s)

[double](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m55s)

[checking uh let's see uh let's see this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m56s)

[should be client and then we just delete](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h47m59s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m02s)

[line upload release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m03s)

[asset low API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m08s)

[client just to avoid having to create a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m11s)

[ton of these things I have a feeling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m15s)

[low API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m20s)

[client this will cut down significantly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m22s)

[on the amount of pain and suffering I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m25s)

[deal with um because I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m27s)

[think let's see here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m32s)

[client uh this guy here is probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m35s)

[doing the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m38s)

[thing yep oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m40s)

[API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m43s)

[client now we don't have to create all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m44s)

[these instances and it will be much](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m47s)

[faster there's a a running joke that I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m49s)

[usually tell people is in C you don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h48m51s)

[paused while it cleans up your mess so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m17s)

[um now I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m30s)

[am going to be conscious of the fact](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m32s)

[that we are creating one of these things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m35s)

[and I do have some State here that I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m38s)

[need to make sure is appropriately](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m41s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m45s)

[see this this here is a Threading bug](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m50s)

[right this is a Threading bug that may](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m53s)

[not be obvious to to many people right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m56s)

[is we come in here we read the property](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h49m59s)

[we check if the value after uh reading](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m03s)

[the property is not null and then we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m06s)

[read the property a second time and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m08s)

[return](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m10s)

[that right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m12s)

[so the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m16s)

[one of the easiest ways to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m20s)

[something thread safe is to pull it into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m21s)

[a local variable because local variables](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m24s)

[are thread safe by](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m26s)

[definition right when you're inside of a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m28s)

[function only one thread can be touching](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m31s)

[that variable unless you hand it off by](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m34s)

[ref to someone else right so the easiest](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m36s)

[thing to do is now we read the property](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m39s)

[once cach it in a local variable if it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m41s)

[is not null then we will return turn](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m45s)

[that cached variable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m49s)

[instead right much simpler much](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m51s)

[simpler um there is still the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m55s)

[possibility of timing issues if like two](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h50m57s)

[threads come in they both check they're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m00s)

[both null we then go through and we we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m02s)

[make this call here um I am interested](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m04s)

[in why we are not caching the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m12s)

[response down here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m16s)

[like who sets this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m22s)

[property no one so that's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m27s)

[bug because we have a method whose](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m31s)

[purpose in life is to cash and it no it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m35s)

[no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m38s)

[cachy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m39s)

[so right so we'll do this so it is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m45s)

[possible that we still end up making two](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m48s)

[calls here when we didn't need to but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m50s)

[that I think is mitigated by the fact](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m52s)

[that we should only be calling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m54s)

[the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h51m58s)

[um it we should only be calling the get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m02s)

[flow client from the top level entry](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m04s)

[point and not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m06s)

[nested and now that all of these things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m07s)

[are moving static that kind of gives me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m09s)

[a lot of hope that we aren't going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m12s)

[have nearly as](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m14s)

[many potential threading issues](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m15s)

[um okay not real concerned with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m21s)

[those uh sorry I'm looking at these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m25s)

[little blue little uh the little blue uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m27s)

[boxes here they they indicate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m32s)

[information messages but they also are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m35s)

[flagging things like spelling mistakes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m39s)

[so it's like yeah I'm kind of I'm kind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m41s)

[of scrolling through some of them very](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m43s)

[quickly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m45s)

[um okay now this guy here is inside of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m49s)

[velop Pac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m54s)

[flow I believe this has n abbility](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m55s)

[enabled which means this is not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h52m59s)

[necessary we can turn that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m02s)

[off](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m07s)

[um okay so that gets us all the way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m08s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m12s)

[through there for some of the cleanup](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m13s)

[now](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m16s)

[the code path in question that was I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m18s)

[believe causing the grief was going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m22s)

[be around upload latest release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m25s)

[assets so let's see what's going on so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m28s)

[have working script here that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m32s)

[effectively does the same thing right so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m35s)

[we're going to ignore all of this here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m38s)

[because none of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m40s)

[actually from here down is the only part](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m42s)

[that is likely um interesting in terms](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m46s)

[of it so there's a login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m49s)

[command it this is called get but it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m52s)

[really uh upsert project ID so it gets](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m55s)

[or creates project ID same with Channel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h53m58s)

[ID and pulls those back so given](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m02s)

[that question becomes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m11s)

[where where would the where would this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m14s)

[thing fall apart right so assert](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m16s)

[authenticated is going to be the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m18s)

[equivalent of the VPK login it at least](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m20s)

[will validate that login was called](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m22s)

[Somewhere in the the code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m27s)

[path right um I'm actually surprised](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m31s)

[there wasn't a bug before given that we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m35s)

[weren't actually caching the results but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m38s)

[I guess that wasn't an issue with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m40s)

[the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m44s)

[oth because if we look look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m46s)

[the um VPK publish command](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m50s)

[Runner see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m54s)

[publish band](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m57s)

[Runner this guy here right he will have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h54m59s)

[in created the client invoked](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m04s)

[login and then after it is invoked login](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m09s)

[it'll call upload release asset so the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m11s)

[only way so this is just guarding](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m14s)

[against our uh a mistake higher up but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m17s)

[there should be no way we get to here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m20s)

[where we aren't in an authenticated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m21s)

[State because that would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m23s)

[require login to return](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m26s)

[true when we are not in fact logged in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m29s)

[so that one's there gets a channel name](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m33s)

[build release assets pulls this in gets](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m37s)

[release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m40s)

[entities pulls back a full asset so when](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m42s)

[vpac builds up your installer the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m46s)

[key things that it builds are um a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m49s)

[setup.exe for you at least on Windows um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m53s)

[a Nate package that represents the full](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m56s)

[package of all the things and then a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h55m58s)

[Delta package with the prior release um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m00s)

[it may also include a portable zip for x](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m02s)

[copy style](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m06s)

[deployments um just to see how it goes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m08s)

[awesome C](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m12s)

[films um just as a way of pulling those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m15s)

[those things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m19s)

[back um and so pulling these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m21s)

[things see here let's move that down so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m26s)

[it pulls out the installer files pulls](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m30s)

[out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m33s)

[the release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m35s)

[assets this gives me a bit of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m39s)

[pause but now we build up the flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m43s)

[client and and we're going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m47s)

[execute uh let's see so creating](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m49s)

[release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h56m53s)

[version so and this is one of the things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m00s)

[that gets a little weird right because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m02s)

[for the average user they think they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m04s)

[they will likely think of a release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m07s)

[group as a release right I'm doing my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m08s)

[1.0 release makes sense um but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m10s)

[functionally behind the scenes what that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m15s)

[means is you need a change Channel and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m17s)

[you need a release group so it should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m18s)

[create a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m20s)

[channel and I think that aligns with my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m22s)

[script just double check because I only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m26s)

[know this because I ran this the other](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m29s)

[day and it it actually was able to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m30s)

[publish so Channel goes through it takes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m33s)

[there's two possible parameters of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m37s)

[project or package](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m40s)

[ID and so either one of those this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m44s)

[should serialize is yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m47s)

[name package](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m50s)

[ID okay I see no issues with that that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m52s)

[are at least obvious right um name I was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h57m57s)

[doing project ID but it did package ID](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m02s)

[create channel and then it returns it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m05s)

[back it will functionally do an upsert](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m08s)

[on the back end if it already](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m11s)

[exists that way there can be a blind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m13s)

[creation so it creates the channel if it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m16s)

[doesn't exist it's interesting to me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m18s)

[that this doesn't return anything back](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m20s)

[why does the color not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m22s)

[needed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m27s)

[oh that's interesting because it's going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m31s)

[to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m35s)

[create the channel from the string a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m37s)

[second](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m41s)

[time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m42s)

[so that will work as long as the string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m45s)

[name is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m49s)

[unique which given that it's an upsert](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m51s)

[it should be because you shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m54s)

[able to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m57s)

[have two different](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h58m59s)

[ones okay so create release group](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m03s)

[Channel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m05s)

[identifier package ID version let me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m06s)

[check this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m10s)

[here uh so for the release group](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m12s)

[uh wait](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m22s)

[why I'm missing something I'm missing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m26s)

[something very obvious](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m28s)

[here this should work let's let me let](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m34s)

[me pull my Swagger in point uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m37s)

[group and let's just double check what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m52s)

[we're hitting create release group a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m54s)

[sync this should be the post](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m56s)

[endpoint yeah so create release group a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=02h59m59s)

[sync](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m02s)

[post](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m03s)

[identifier](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m10s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m13s)

[so package ID version Channel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m15s)

[identifier this does](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m19s)

[go what does to normalize string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m22s)

[do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m26s)

[okay this is the new get versioning](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m28s)

[one okay that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m33s)

[should work I don't see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m36s)

[any issues there that creates the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m40s)

[release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m44s)

[group it should parse it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m45s)

[back which it is returning it back](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m48s)

[okay and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m52s)

[then files to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m54s)

[upload oh oh I don't think kayin knows](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h00m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m00s)

[trick because he's doing asset to oh the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m01s)

[okay here's a cool trick right so this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m04s)

[guy here get non-released assets that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m07s)

[a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m10s)

[string what's what's not obvious here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m12s)

[right is because of this link this is an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m14s)

[array](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m17s)

[um that's going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m19s)

[between uh file type and name I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m21s)

[believe yeah so what what you do down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m25s)

[here so rather than doing this Tuple and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m29s)

[doing this item one right so what you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m31s)

[can actually do is you can do what's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m34s)

[called uh uh deconstruction so you can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m36s)

[go string file path file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m40s)

[type and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m46s)

[and oh it doesn't want the types on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m48s)

[there right so rather than item one I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m51s)

[can do file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m54s)

[path then item one I can do file path](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h01m56s)

[and then I can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m01s)

[do other then type maybe I should do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m03s)

[file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m05s)

[type there something like that so you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m11s)

[can actually deconstruct the tupal it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m13s)

[a way to be able to get a for each with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m16s)

[uh multiple values going through it it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m19s)

[one of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m21s)

[the the coolest tricks that came with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m22s)

[the value people when they added it to C](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m25s)

[that I don't think many people caught](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m27s)

[that that was a feature that was added](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m30s)

[because sometimes you want to for each](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m32s)

[over a couple of things right it's nice](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m34s)

[to have more than one iterator](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m36s)

[variable so C deconstruction you're Off](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m38s)

[to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m43s)

[Races um okay so that goes through there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m44s)

[uploads release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m47s)

[assets great and this is going to do a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m50s)

[progress reporter thingy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m53s)

[mobber](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m55s)

[okay and then previous version](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h02m57s)

[downloading Delta base so it's it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m01s)

[retrieving](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m03s)

[back the the prior release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m05s)

[version I wonder if this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m08s)

[fails I wonder if this fails I think it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m11s)

[might if you request a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m14s)

[a a download latest release and you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m21s)

[doing your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m24s)

[1.0 I don't think there is a Delta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m25s)

[base](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m33s)

[um because this is trying to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m35s)

[grab previous nugate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m39s)

[package I don't know that this is going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m41s)

[to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m44s)

[work well let's look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m46s)

[look so this is officially the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m48s)

[non-public](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m51s)

[repo don't worry as owner of the company](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m52s)

[I can show nonpublic repo and I'm very](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m56s)

[confident I won't get sued by myself](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h03m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m00s)

[um yeah so if I go through and look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m03s)

[the API and I look at the releases and I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m06s)

[look at because this is using which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m10s)

[endpoint here right get this is the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m13s)

[overloaded method right so it's V1](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m17s)

[download pulling back package ID](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m21s)

[channel hey D Vinci Dev oh I am sorry to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m28s)

[hear that about the power that is I will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m31s)

[say one of the most frustrating](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m33s)

[things software development is really](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m35s)

[great right up until](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m38s)

[uh you can't use](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m40s)

[it so this one here will return not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m45s)

[found if there if there's nothing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m49s)

[there right it'll also return not found](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m52s)

[if the thing requested isn't a published](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m56s)

[release group so it is going to filter](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h04m58s)

[that down](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m00s)

[show given](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m03s)

[that what is this guy going to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m06s)

[download latest release one you see flow](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m10s)

[API being reused so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m15s)

[kill that sucker](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m18s)

[off um and we can](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m19s)

[do static and then we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m23s)

[can jump here and this should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m26s)

[be client that way we don't have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m29s)

[reuse](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m32s)

[it so this guy here is going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m37s)

[to it's interesting because this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m44s)

[this is just blindly going to assume](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m49s)

[that this file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m51s)

[exists what is how huh I'm confused is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h05m55s)

[this is just going to open read uh that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m00s)

[that that not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m03s)

[okay this is this no no no no no no no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m05s)

[so okay we got to we got to do something](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m10s)

[here we got to do something here because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m12s)

[this is passing in what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m15s)

[but previous version this guy takes in a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m18s)

[local path right this guy's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m20s)

[come in here this guy's going to come in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m23s)

[here this is going to make a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m24s)

[call if status is 404 this is going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m27s)

[throw an API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m32s)

[exception uh that show that's no bueno](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m37s)

[that no buo Okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m41s)

[what do we expect this thing to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m51s)

[do that's the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m53s)

[question I don't like how nwag generates](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h06m59s)

[stuff I really don't like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m00s)

[it like it makes sense that this thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m04s)

[would throw an API exception but that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m06s)

[now means that this guy up here needs to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m09s)

[handle](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m12s)

[it uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m16s)

[but see here's the thing like I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m19s)

[like that this thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m21s)

[throws I kind of want to just suppress](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m24s)

[API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m27s)

[exception on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m31s)

[404 right I don't like this generated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m33s)

[underscore](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m37s)

[stuff um so maybe we just suppress](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m38s)

[that catch API exception](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m44s)

[E](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m47s)

[when](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m53s)

[okay uh and then rather than doing this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h07m58s)

[we can do HTTP status](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m01s)

[code not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m04s)

[found](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m07s)

[right I would much rather do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m09s)

[that than the alternative which I should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m12s)

[probably change that over here too right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m16s)

[I don't like magical inss like I realize](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m18s)

[most people should know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m22s)

[this but I'm also very aware that like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m24s)

[especially new devs coming](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m28s)

[in in college they don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m31s)

[teach](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m34s)

[um a lot of some a lot of these Basics](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m36s)

[like I I had one college grad who](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m40s)

[started working for us uh and they asked](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m42s)

[the question they're like hey where did](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m45s)

[you learn all this networking stuff and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m47s)

[I'm like well for me I ended up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m49s)

[initially thinking that I was uh going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m54s)

[to go down the path](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h08m57s)

[of uh network security and being assis](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m00s)

[admin and then decided nah that isn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m03s)

[that isn't really for me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m06s)

[um sorry we're going to just clean this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m09s)

[pattern match all the things to Victory](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m13s)

[so I I decided I was like no I'm G to I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m16s)

[I like programming a lot better let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m18s)

[let's go down that route which was fine](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m20s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m22s)

[great but it also highlighted that most](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m23s)

[of the time universities don't teach](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m27s)

[kind of some of that fundamental stuff](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m30s)

[they often teach like at least around](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m32s)

[here they teach like an operating](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m33s)

[systems class where people get kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m35s)

[like this touch of assembly and they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m37s)

[kind of understand a pipeline processor](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m39s)

[a little bit and there's there's at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m41s)

[least enough there to where it's like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m43s)

[okay you write some code and you start](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m44s)

[to know it but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m46s)

[like practically most of the students](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m47s)

[are not going to get jobs where they are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m49s)

[working in low-level stuff the vast](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m51s)

[majority of jobs out there you work in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m54s)

[higher level languages you you're you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m56s)

[working in web-based stuff at JavaScript](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h09m59s)

[like nobody writing web front ends](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m01s)

[thinks about assembly maybe web assembly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m03s)

[but not like low-level assembly it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m06s)

[like it's not really a thing that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m08s)

[matters to the vast majority of people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m11s)

[like I get it it's a good idea to make](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m13s)

[somebody a little more well-rounded on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m14s)

[how the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m16s)

[how the sausage is made but it is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m17s)

[not it is not the common path by any](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m20s)

[stretch of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m23s)

[imagination okay so we will deal with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m24s)

[the 404](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m26s)

[issue and then what we need to do here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m28s)

[is if file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m30s)

[exists right then we'll do this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m33s)

[otherwise we're going to return](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m36s)

[null right and then what we're going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m38s)

[do here is we're going to null coess](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m40s)

[this and this is kind of a dirty trick](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m43s)

[so this is using What's called the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m46s)

[lifted operator so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m48s)

[the uh what are you complaining](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m52s)

[about oh that's that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h10m57s)

[fun that is kind of annoying that that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m01s)

[bang is there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m04s)

[um is when doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m07s)

[comparisons with uh nullable types](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m10s)

[null uh short circuits and returns false](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m14s)

[for the comparison so you can do these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m17s)

[kind of wacky comparisons here I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m19s)

[what's biting me is the property here is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m21s)

[also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m25s)

[knowable which is going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m27s)

[break the the cheater](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m29s)

[trick](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m34s)

[um uh what is it semantic version](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m39s)

[something give me your type do you have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m42s)

[a nullable empty](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m44s)

[or similar property on you I just want I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h11m47s)

[only gets](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m25s)

[new oh that's not what the zero key on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m28s)

[me keyboard looks like let's try this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m31s)

[again](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m32s)

[right because this will this should zero](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m34s)

[it all the way out right empty null](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m37s)

[perfect that's all I want so what we'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m41s)

[um zero](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m49s)

[version](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m56s)

[there we'll do something of that nature](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h12m59s)

[because we're doing this previous zip](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m02s)

[thing uh okay so this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m05s)

[greater than or equal to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m16s)

[oh I can't have this thing be a zero on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m20s)

[a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m24s)

[null okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m28s)

[so do this we'll do we'll do this a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m30s)

[little differently so if uh rev](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m33s)

[zip not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m39s)

[null oh actually we can do oh we can do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m45s)

[this we can do this how can I make the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m49s)

[code less readable in one simple](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m53s)

[step oh you want a constant don't you oh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m56s)

[you're killing me you're killing me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h13m59s)

[you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m01s)

[killing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m06s)

[um uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m13s)

[that now we can get away with the bang](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m20s)

[because we've checked it ahead of time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m21s)

[okay it does mean that we need to come](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m24s)

[down here and if so this we only we only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m26s)

[need this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m30s)

[information this is building and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m36s)

[uploading Delta](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m38s)

[packages um this whole thing is going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m41s)

[be if previous zip](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m44s)

[is not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m47s)

[null and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m49s)

[actually you know what we should do we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m52s)

[should do this up here we should get rid](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m54s)

[of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m57s)

[this and then we should take this guy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h14m58s)

[here and do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m02s)

[this right so we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m05s)

[only we only do any of this work if we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m09s)

[actually have a previous version okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m13s)

[that comes in here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m16s)

[here then we publish release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m18s)

[group because effectively you upload all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m23s)

[of the individual files to the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m25s)

[release group itself and then you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m27s)

[actually change it state to published](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m29s)

[because you start with an empty release](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m32s)

[group that's a draft that you can just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m33s)

[kind of throw things in until you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m34s)

[happy with it and then you publish it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m36s)

[and then if you're waiting for it to go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m39s)

[live CU once you once you publish](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m40s)

[the the wait for it to go live](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m44s)

[live what is it checking for here failed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m49s)

[to get release group status it may not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m51s)

[be live](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m53s)

[yet yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h15m59s)

[so this is waiting for all of the things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m01s)

[to go through why are we lower casing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m05s)

[status isn't this an En oh status isn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m08s)

[an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m11s)

[enom ooh I might need to change that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m12s)

[we're going to do that like I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m22s)

[invariant casing shouldn't matter here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m23s)

[because the the system sending it isn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m26s)

[localized but I just feel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m29s)

[safer let's see within five minute](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m36s)

[timeout I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m42s)

[I don't like that this because this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m51s)

[saying a 5 minute timeout and yes 300](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m54s)

[seconds is 5 minutes but that ignores](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h16m58s)

[the API call](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m01s)

[my partner wrote and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m15s)

[I'm reversing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m18s)

[it is this an okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m21s)

[message if because it's not doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m24s)

[cup](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m43s)

[I am wondering if this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m48s)

[is oh see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m53s)

[perfect you know you know how to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h17m57s)

[party](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m00s)

[um that's probably fine I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m03s)

[worry about it for now okay so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m06s)

[should handle all of that I think should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m08s)

[be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m12s)

[fine should be should be just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m13s)

[fine okay so the likely](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m19s)

[breaks we may have solved some of them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m25s)

[by doing this this is one of those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m27s)

[things that I I always feel like you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m30s)

[should clean up code first and then and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m31s)

[then chase the bugs because that will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m34s)

[likely solve a lot of your problems okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m37s)

[let's go here let's go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m39s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m42s)

[um uh let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m45s)

[see uh cleanup flow client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m47s)

[to I can't type only create uh API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h18m54s)

[client](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m02s)

[once this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m04s)

[is per logical](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m07s)

[operation not a real](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m11s)

[Singleton um because we will do once for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m15s)

[login once for public operations it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m17s)

[like yeah that's fine that's that I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m20s)

[not overly concerned about um because](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m23s)

[the slow part of the login will not be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m27s)

[the instantiation of the client I assure](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m29s)

[you the API is for off for b2c is much](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m32s)

[much](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m38s)

[slower](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m39s)

[um fixed up issue with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m48s)

[Deltas uh always](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m50s)

[assuming there would be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m54s)

[a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h19m59s)

[successful response which I kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m02s)

[wonder if that was the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m05s)

[bug I kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m12s)

[Wonder so let's push this and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m14s)

[then no thank you get Kraken I know I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m19s)

[know I have a fork of this repo but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m22s)

[only made that to test some Fork related](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m25s)

[problems](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m28s)

[um what was that being for yeah thank](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m31s)

[you okay so we pulled that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m34s)

[up um let's see the only things out here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m38s)

[are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m41s)

[dependencies we pushed all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m42s)

[stuff reload](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m45s)

[oh Visual Studio don't scare me like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m48s)

[that okay now the question is can I run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m51s)

[this locally and I think that's going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m55s)

[hinge on my ability to run this script](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h20m58s)

[here which I don't know if it actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m02s)

[works or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m05s)

[not so uh we're going to just run it see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m07s)

[what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m10s)

[happens uh let's see view where's my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m11s)

[terminal terminal okay uh build VPK this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m14s)

[is actually one of the most obnoxious](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m19s)

[things about this entire process stop is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m21s)

[our build process for building velop Pac](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m25s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m27s)

[insane absolutely insane like here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m29s)

[here's let me let me give a just a brief](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m32s)

[Gander of how absolutely insane this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m35s)

[and we've been talking about how to try](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m38s)

[to make it easier so it doesn't suck for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m40s)

[people who want to contribute but it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m42s)

[it's absolutely](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m45s)

[insane so part of the issue is oh look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m47s)

[it's going to build publish For Me Andy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m52s)

[that'll be a perfect one to show right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m54s)

[so let's just be clear](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m56s)

[right I pushed a branch on a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h21m58s)

[PR 14 jobs three jobs three more jobs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m01s)

[and then all of these rust related jobs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m05s)

[like it is it is a lot of stuff and it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m07s)

[because there's so many moving parts and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m10s)

[some things have to be compiled on Linux](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m12s)

[some things have to be compiled on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m14s)

[Windows some tests have to be run on uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m15s)

[platform specific stuff it becomes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m18s)

[crazy uh let's see I've been having such](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m22s)

[a hard time with Maui's build process](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m24s)

[sometimes just creating a simple XE is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m27s)

[nightmare yes the the the fact that you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m29s)

[say XE makes me suspect Maui targeting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m32s)

[windows and the win UI process the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m35s)

[best documentation you will find](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m39s)

[uh muui Ms build and this is the this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m42s)

[the this is the sucky part is you have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m47s)

[to understand how Maui Works under the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m50s)

[hood to actually use it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m52s)

[properly um this is this the one here I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h22m56s)

[think this might be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m00s)

[it like you have to know that Maui's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m03s)

[doing the the wi UI stuff under the hood](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m06s)

[yeah this one here this one here is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m10s)

[good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m13s)

[one um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m14s)

[because wi UI has both packaged and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m18s)

[unpackaged and dear Heavens buckle up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m21s)

[right unpackaged is nice but like this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m25s)

[is how much work it is just to produce](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m29s)

[an unpackaged XY like that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m31s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m36s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m38s)

[right like the fact that you have to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m39s)

[things like setup Ms build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m42s)

[is insane to to me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m44s)

[absolutely absolutely insane and that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m48s)

[that completely ignores the Maui](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m50s)

[workload and Tool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m52s)

[chain](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m54s)

[um yeah the and that's yeah I only know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h23m58s)

[this because I I have been working on a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m03s)

[Maui app in my my day job and we have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m05s)

[gone through similar pain and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m08s)

[suffering so don't feel bad um ours had](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m11s)

[a bunch of extra constraints and private](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m14s)

[nou get feeds and extra things that went](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m16s)

[into it that that added to the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m18s)

[difficulty behind it it wasn't just you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m20s)

[know build and run but yeah the the key](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m23s)

[thing if you're targeting Windows is to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m26s)

[know that it's wiui 3 and often times](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m29s)

[you have to find you have to look up the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m33s)

[wi UI documentation to get the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m36s)

[appropriate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m38s)

[incantations for it um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m39s)

[just inside thing like that's both](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m43s)

[so side tangent side tangent right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m47s)

[uh so that that is the fundamental](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m54s)

[difference I think between avalonia and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h24m57s)

[do they have thought they had yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m01s)

[they've got some stuff up here um the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m04s)

[difference between an avalonia app and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m07s)

[a um and a a Maui or wi UI like Maui is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m10s)

[just designed for Native](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m16s)

[controls and so you write your your UI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m18s)

[once and there's that middle translation](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m21s)

[layer to get you down to Native right so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m23s)

[on the positive side you get native](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m25s)

[controls on the down side you've got an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m27s)

[abstraction layer between you and Native](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m30s)

[controls that you sometimes have to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m31s)

[battle with it also means that if wiui](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m34s)

[has a bug Maui has a bug right there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m36s)

[there's there's no getting around it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m39s)

[like when you wise the foundation and if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m40s)

[your foundation has a crack you have a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m42s)

[crack and so there are a lot of things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m44s)

[that get categorized as Maui issues that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m47s)

[aren't always Maui's fault they're an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m49s)

[underlying issue on on a lower level](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m52s)

[that they can either like try to work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m56s)

[around or sometimes they just have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m58s)

[throw up their hands and go sorry this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h25m59s)

[isn't our stuff right like so you get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m01s)

[bit whereas avalonia they own the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m04s)

[rendering stack top to bottom so you get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m07s)

[common looking feel across all your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m10s)

[platforms which some people like some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m12s)

[people don't like there's a plus as a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m14s)

[minus there right it's not it's not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m15s)

[native looking feeli it's common looking](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m17s)

[feeli which is different but they own](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m18s)

[the rendering stack so they encounter](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m22s)

[far fewer issues because they they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m24s)

[aren't they don't have the this wacky](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m26s)

[dependency chain underneath](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m28s)

[them yeah having those issues with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m31s)

[translating native controls and Mac yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m33s)

[and that that is that is one of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m35s)

[things like Maui gives you some Escape](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m36s)

[hatches with like their effects and you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m38s)

[can dive down into like the renderers if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m40s)

[you want to get to those native platform](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m42s)

[controls but then then you have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m44s)

[realize okay I'm Switching gears I'm now](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m46s)

[writing native iOS or or native uh uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m48s)

[Mac OSX code in order to do all of that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m53s)

[and so in my mind it it adds to it adds](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h26m57s)

[to the load of what you need to know to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m00s)

[do it well and makes it harder so that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m02s)

[part of why I've I've really liked](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m06s)

[avalonia with again the downside being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m07s)

[it's common looking feel which some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m09s)

[people don't like right and that doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m11s)

[mean you can't do Platform specific](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m14s)

[stuff it just means that the default out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m15s)

[of the box it's going to render the same](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m18s)

[way on all platforms unless you do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m20s)

[something right you have to do work if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m22s)

[you want something different fine that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m24s)

[that so be it but it is it is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m27s)

[fundamentally different architectures](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m29s)

[between the two the other thing is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m30s)

[avalonia only added Mobile Android and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m32s)

[iOS support](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m35s)

[like a one major version ago so it's so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m38s)

[so the whereas Maui started mobile first](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m42s)

[and desktop kind of came along second](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m45s)

[and I don't really want to say that cuz](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m48s)

[Maui stepped in with Windows always](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m49s)

[there but Maui very much feels like a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m51s)

[mobile first thing whereas avalone is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m54s)

[more desktop first so do with that what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m56s)

[you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h27m59s)

[will so depending on what you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m00s)

[building those can potentially](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m02s)

[influence your stuff okay we're going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m06s)

[kill all that or kill all that okay so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m08s)

[wanted to see why my script failed out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m10s)

[because I would love](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m13s)

[air tool chain all of this stuff okay so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m16s)

[I may have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m20s)

[bugs oh and my I just got a lovely email](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m22s)

[notification saying my pipeline failed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m25s)

[okay so what test did I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m27s)

[break what test did I break so I've](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m30s)

[clearly broken a test this is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m32s)

[unfortunate part about tests is now you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m34s)

[get to break them um and oh this is both](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m35s)

[a blessing and curse so something that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m40s)

[we do is we actually will kill if one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m42s)

[test fails because our other test runs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m45s)

[can occupy a significant number of build](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m47s)

[minutes will kill the other ones too but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m49s)

[sometimes I want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m52s)

[that that stuff that sounds fine to me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m54s)

[all I care about is crossplatform](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h28m57s)

[compatibility yeah and actually I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m00s)

[looking to do over like probably in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m02s)

[next couple months I may start doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m06s)

[some more avalonia content streams like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m08s)

[I I feel like that's one of the the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m12s)

[areas where it's lacking it doesn't have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m14s)

[it doesn't have a lot of content around](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m18s)

[it um like some on some hands it's like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m20s)

[oh it's new it's like well it's been](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m23s)

[around](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m26s)

[for six years like it's it's been around](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m27s)

[for a little while but it's I I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m31s)

[finally reached a level of maturity](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m33s)

[where it's like oh these are this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m35s)

[like serious player on the field now](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m38s)

[we're we're not we're no longer the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m41s)

[rookie we're like now we're playing with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m43s)

[the big boys so it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m45s)

[like yeah but it does mean that there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m47s)

[are some there is not nearly as much uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m51s)

[third party support as there might be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m55s)

[for something that's Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h29m57s)

[backed yeah and Maui Maui has been](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m01s)

[struggling as of late um I don't know if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m04s)

[you caught there was an announcement for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m06s)

[Maui that came out October November](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m09s)

[somewhere in that vicinity um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m13s)

[so there was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m20s)

[a yeah this this this blog post here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m24s)

[right so um I will summarize um the syn](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m28s)

[fusion had a vested interest in wanting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m34s)

[to make their toolkit awesome on Maui](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m36s)

[but was unhappy with the speed at which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m40s)

[some of the Maui things were being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m42s)

[resolved so syn Fusion dedicated some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m43s)

[number of developers I don't know what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m46s)

[it was um but some number of developers](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m49s)

[to go and just work on Maui and so the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m53s)

[Maui team like they got slammed I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h30m57s)

[trying to remember did they show the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m00s)

[numbers it was it was insane the number](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m01s)

[of items that sink Fusion](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m04s)

[closed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m07s)

[um yeah they closed 75 product issues](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m13s)

[but there was more than that like the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m16s)

[number of PRS they did just blew my mind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m18s)

[I was like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m20s)

[how so now admittedly it was a mutually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m21s)

[beneficial relationship right so syn](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m25s)

[Fusion put out their toolkit which](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m27s)

[offers a bunch of free stuff but it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m29s)

[the like they've got the crack dealer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m33s)

[priceing model right the the toolkit's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m34s)

[free but if you want all their controls](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m36s)

[you pay them money right so it's like on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m39s)

[one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m41s)

[hand good on them right they they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m42s)

[released a toolkit with I think it's got](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m44s)

[like 36 controls in it which isn't bad](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m46s)

[but it's like it it it's it's their](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m50s)

[basic toolkit you get to play with it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m53s)

[and it's free so why not right great um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m55s)

[but it is the idea of hey if you like it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h31m58s)

[and you want more we got more for you um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m01s)

[so they contribute to Maui make Maui](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m06s)

[better they get nice free advertising](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m09s)

[and a push for their toolkit to try to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m12s)

[get people to to use syn fusion and so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m14s)

[it's like Maui gets free Dev hours out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m17s)

[of them and they get free advertising](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m20s)

[and people being pushed towards their](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m22s)

[tool kit so it's like okay it works both](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m23s)

[ways](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m26s)

[um yeah it I don't know if it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m29s)

[necessarily damning to bring in people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m32s)

[from another area to do it that like a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m35s)

[lot of Microsoft has been stretched thin](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m38s)

[with their push for all this AI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m41s)

[stuff and the the thing is is like the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m44s)

[Maui team is not huge I don't remember](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m48s)

[how big it is but I I think I can count](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m50s)

[it without taking my socks off so it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m53s)

[not that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m57s)

[massive um and so there's there's only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h32m58s)

[so many hours in a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m00s)

[day that they have to fix stuff and so a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m02s)

[lot of these extra](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m05s)

[developers um I I think what they had](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m07s)

[said in here is they they had kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m09s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m12s)

[the it means that the the lead](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m16s)

[maintainers from Microsoft can focus on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m18s)

[reviewing these PRS from sync Fusion to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m21s)

[out with it because there is a lot there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m44s)

[and I think they've figured out that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m47s)

[because they've they've got such a deep](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m48s)

[dependency chain there's so much like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h33m50s)

[very fast rates and they're trying to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m05s)

[keep up on all of them like the idea of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m07s)

[doing it is great but I feel like Maui](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m10s)

[needs a significantly bigger team to to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m12s)

[do it well and I I don't think they have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m15s)

[the Manpower so having this gives me a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m18s)

[little hope that's it's like okay now](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m21s)

[Manpower](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m24s)

[um yeah yeah and that's the thing is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m26s)

[like uh Apple like I don't think they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m29s)

[they they necessarily have a problem](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m33s)

[with people building Maui apps but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m35s)

[don't think that they spend any amount](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m37s)

[of effort to make it easier or better at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m39s)

[all like I think they go if you want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m42s)

[do that have at it we ain't helping you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m44s)

[which is kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m49s)

[sucky yeah yeah and which is Again part](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m51s)

[of why I go back to the avalonia model](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m55s)

[is I like I like the the structure and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h34m57s)

[the direction that it's going and the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m00s)

[fact that they own the rendering stack](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m02s)

[because it's all skia backed so sk's uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m04s)

[Google's rendering engine that they open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m08s)

[sourced um as part of uh all of their](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m10s)

[stuff which is great and so it um it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m13s)

[it's fast it's efficient it runs on a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m18s)

[bunch of platforms and so Avalon's thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m20s)

[is they get down to a effectively a skia](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m23s)

[surface where they can paint and they do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m25s)

[all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m27s)

[rendering and it lets them go pretty](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m29s)

[pretty quick their their biggest](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m32s)

[disadvantage is they're focused on being](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m34s)

[a crossplatform UI framework not a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m36s)

[crossplatform](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m39s)

[framework and those two things are very](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m40s)

[importantly different which is like ah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h35m43s)

[it like it's weird but in a good way if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h43m36s)

[that makes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h43m40s)

[it but I'm going to run this and I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h43m53s)

[realize it failed on Linux I I just want](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h43m55s)

[to see does this test pass on Windows no](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h43m57s)

[okay well that's good so that means I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h44m01s)

[okay so I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h44m33s)

[may](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h44m41s)

[okay I mean on one hand this is our code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h44m43s)

[so it's very it's very likely that we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h44m46s)

[have done something to break this why is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h44m50s)

huh feel like we can probably kill off a

[couple of these](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m15s)

[but that will be a different](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m18s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m22s)

[what I'm I'm like I'm happy it's failing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m24s)

[on Windows but I'm also less happy that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m27s)

[it's failing with the wrong air](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m29s)

[message but like I didn't expect to get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m32s)

[the same air message as Linux but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m34s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h45m46s)

[uh so what okay so I guess the question](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m04s)

[then is what has happened in this area](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m07s)

[that would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m10s)

[cause okay cuz I didn't make all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m11s)

[changes so let's let's refresh this a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m15s)

[little bit and then I want to look and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m19s)

[see why why can this not actually you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m22s)

[know what this might be an area where](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m25s)

[Kraken works better than](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m28s)

[GitHub I know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m31s)

[shocking uh let's see review code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m33s)

[suggest changes right so I want to look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m35s)

[at the area in here specifically let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m39s)

[see here so this guy here bellac UIL](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m43s)

[symbol link so where you're just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m49s)

[underneath there okay so here's the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m51s)

[interesting part that didn't get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m55s)

[touched so that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h46m59s)

[exciting I don't like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m03s)

[this why what would be causing you to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m08s)

[fail differently I wonder](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m12s)

[because the air in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m15s)

[question required privilege is not held](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m17s)

[client like create create file link okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m26s)

[create is that uh uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m43s)

[create c](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h47m47s)

[to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m01s)

[Native and then we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m07s)

[great um so it's got to be getting okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m12s)

[so we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m16s)

[okay okay let me just make sure I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m17s)

[hitting exactly I'm wondering if I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m20s)

[actually hitting this throw and the air](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m23s)

[Message is just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m25s)

[misleading](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m28s)

[okay okay so this guy is just returning](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m30s)

[fall okay okay so I'm an idiot that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m32s)

[that is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m37s)

[solution because this guy here is just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m41s)

[grabbing the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h48m44s)

[run as admin for this thing to pass I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m02s)

[wonder if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m05s)

[that's if that's the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m07s)

[problem I wonder if that's the problem](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m11s)

[we're going to test that real quick I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m13s)

[have I have this vague](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m15s)

[memory that that is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m17s)

[thing and I I sort of remember this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m21s)

[occurring at one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m24s)

[point yeah let me see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m34s)

[here okay something tells me this m now](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m38s)

[magically](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m41s)

[passes and I'm chasing in a ghost that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m42s)

[is a complete red herring and not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m45s)

[related at all to the changes that were](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m48s)

[made okay I'm chasing a ghost okay ghost](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m53s)

[unmasked ghost not a not a real not a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h49m57s)

[real bug okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m00s)

[so if that's the case then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m04s)

[go back](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m07s)

[here actually you know what no you stay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m08s)

[there um I am going to just kick this a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m10s)

[second time really quick because I have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m14s)

[a sinking](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m16s)

[suspicion that this may not fail a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m18s)

[second](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m21s)

[time my visual student normally asks if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m25s)

[I want to run my code that requires](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m27s)

[admin yeah and in a lot of cases things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m29s)

[will prompt for elevation if they need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m31s)

[it um in this case because we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m33s)

[are we are straight up invoking](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m37s)

[um uh win32 apis you don't necessarily](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m41s)

[get um that level of elevation unless](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m48s)

[you check for it right we actually have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m51s)

[code inside of our bootstrapping](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m54s)

[applications so like the the update](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m56s)

[exe um that will check uh when they need](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h50m59s)

[to do an elevated call and then prompt](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m04s)

[but if you just straight up invoke win32](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m08s)

[apis you can easily get rejected by that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m10s)

[and you're just expected to handle](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m13s)

[it which is exciting but given that this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m15s)

[is coming from a test I'm not that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m19s)

[concerned right so it's like okay great](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m22s)

[fine and when you run on a GitHub action](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m25s)

[you're going to be running as a user](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m28s)

[that has admin privileges which is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m30s)

[blessing and a curse right on one hand](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m33s)

[you don't run into permissions problems](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m35s)

[on the other hand you don't find your](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m37s)

[permissions bugs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m39s)

[so yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m43s)

[sword Cuts both](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m45s)

[ways okay I just want to I I want to see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m47s)

[this thing actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m50s)

[work and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m52s)

[then okay and while that's while that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m55s)

[thinking about what it's done I would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h51m57s)

[like to look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m00s)

[the so I need to replicate this sucker](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m03s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m07s)

[um cannot find](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m11s)

[bellac work trees](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m14s)

[what am I on a funky](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m17s)

[Branch nope I am an](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m21s)

[idiot uh the vpac route that is not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m25s)

[where I want to be because this is not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m29s)

[right I'm going to leave that there for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m33s)

[a moment because that is my work tree](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m35s)

[path but this guy here is wanting to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m38s)

[look for velop Pac up One Direction Tory](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m42s)

[and then over and I'm pretty confident](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m45s)

[it's going to be more](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m47s)

[like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m49s)

[that but we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m51s)

[just test that really quick so CD uper](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m53s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m57s)

[LS and then C uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h52m59s)

[CD little pack yeah so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m05s)

[that's uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m09s)

[there so that is more likely what we're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m15s)

[going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m18s)

[for okay so let's clear that Rerun](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m20s)

[script because I'd like to have my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m27s)

[script working](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m29s)

[again into it really should get into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m32s)

[using GitHub yeah so on one hand GitHub](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m34s)

[is nice because it is probably the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m38s)

[biggest most popular git provider out](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m40s)

[there right on the other hand I think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m43s)

[what's most important is that people](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m46s)

[learn and know how to use get itself and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m49s)

[so like there are nice things that you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m54s)

[can pick up and there's a lot of um good](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h53m57s)

[knowledge courses around GitHub but the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m00s)

[basic Source control interaction is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m03s)

[not anything overly special in my mind](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m06s)

[the the special sauce with GitHub comes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m09s)

[around with like the GitHub actions or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m11s)

[their security stuff or the code](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m14s)

[scanning or all this all the kind of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m16s)

[add-ons that go around](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m18s)

[it let's see could not find part of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m21s)

[path blah blah blah because doesn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m24s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m27s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m30s)

[uh her was denied when trying to create](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m33s)

[the Sim Link in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m36s)

[everything and so it's kind of fresh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h54m57s)

[though it's fresh after I've played with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m00s)

[it for a couple weeks and installed a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m02s)

[crap](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m05s)

[double-checking that I wasn't crazy and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m27s)

[had um installed the wrong](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m30s)

[version okay well Mac passed that makes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m35s)

[me feel better and Ubuntu is still](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m38s)

[running which makes me also feel](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m39s)

[better um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m42s)

[yeah so it got past the test again](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m47s)

[so potential flaky test on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m50s)

[Linux but not that flaky since it was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m53s)

[one kick and done](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m56s)

[so maybe there's something there maybe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h55m58s)

[not I kicked it and the problem went](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m02s)

[away](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m04s)

[um I just saved my source manual to a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m13s)

[cloud and that's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m16s)

[it yeah and if you're um if you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m17s)

[interested in learning it uh there's a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m22s)

[lot](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m25s)

[of trying to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m26s)

[think](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m33s)

[uh so this is what I would argue is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m35s)

[actually what](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m38s)

[is is what what people should actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m41s)

[know in terms of like managing their](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m44s)

[Source control stuff like this is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m47s)

[important stuff right which git provider](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m49s)

[you're using to host](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m53s)

[it right like when when we go to hire](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m55s)

[developers I care that they know get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h56m58s)

[with any major source control provider I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m01s)

[don't really care which one it is like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m06s)

[they can know](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m08s)

[devops uh they can know bit bucket they](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m10s)

[can know GitHub it's like like can you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m13s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m15s)

[great um okay so Kaylin I'll show you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m17s)

[this since you're sitting there um I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m21s)

[think I was I I haven't actually gotten](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m25s)

[my local setup to run the code so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m29s)

[would](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m31s)

[um so I can't say for certain but I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m34s)

[think the problem of what was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m37s)

[potentially biting you is down inside of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m40s)

[here this guy so this download latest](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m50s)

[release this one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m55s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h57m58s)

[um and this is after I I kind of cleaned](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m00s)

[it up a little this guy is going to run](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m03s)

[into this not found case in the case of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m06s)

[a v1.0 because there isn't a previous](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m08s)

[installer to pull down so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m11s)

[I suspect it would then hit this API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m14s)

[exception and Bubble Up and that may](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m19s)

[have been what you saw because you said](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m22s)

[400 this would have been a 404 on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m24s)

[status so I that that gives me a bit of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m27s)

[pause](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m31s)

[um on one of the upload oh one of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m34s)

[uploads 400](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m37s)

[oh me back up and look at this again](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m39s)

[because if there wasn't a prior upload](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m45s)

[that should have 404d on you and then](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m47s)

[this thing didn't handle that case very](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m49s)

[nicely so I I cleaned that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m52s)

[up but one of the uploads](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h58m55s)

[400 let me back this sucker up so that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m00s)

[would be in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m06s)

[here okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m11s)

[file parameter upload release also I'm](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m15s)

[not a fan of what n swag generates it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m17s)

[yucky um but I also don't know what to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m21s)

[tell you to do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m25s)

[differently so content type multiform](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m28s)

[boundary there and there may be the fact](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m32s)

[that you had to write that partial](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m34s)

[method for download to file makes me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m35s)

[suspect that I might need to change the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m37s)

[uh open API spec file because it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m40s)

[shouldn't have like it should have](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m44s)

[generated that method for you that was](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m46s)

[the the next thing to dig](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m48s)

[into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m50s)

[uh who uses query prams](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=03h59m54s)

[oh yeah and that's why I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m10s)

[if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m13s)

[because the upload endpoint is done](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m16s)

[slightly differently than some of the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m18s)

[other ones and I am wondering if it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m20s)

[just not if the spec](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m22s)

[on the open API endpoint is just not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m26s)

[right um let's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m31s)

[see give me the Json file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h00m39s)

[okay yeah CU you will definitely get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m06s)

[back if we go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m11s)

[here well I think it's going to be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m16s)

[release methods is where the upload](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m18s)

[is uh upload](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m20s)

[release because it has to parse](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m28s)

[across uh the key with the download](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m37s)

[message if you set the return type in uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m39s)

[we really want to stream it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m43s)

[directly yeah and I was poking I I spent](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m46s)

[a brief couple minutes looking at n swag](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m49s)

[stuff and there was a handful of open](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m52s)

[GitHub issues around it and I went okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m55s)

[I'm not going to waste my time with this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h01m58s)

[um yeah but I agree having the models](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m02s)

[and everything generated will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m05s)

[be highly](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m07s)

[convenient cuz where is I I mean there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m11s)

[there's plenty](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m13s)

[of 400s that can come back from here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m15s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m20s)

[of maybe the file type didn't didn't get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m22s)

[set properly on the upload request it's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m26s)

[weird that only one of them would fail](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m29s)

[though like that that part gives me a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m31s)

[bit of pause that only](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m34s)

[one would be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m37s)

[off where does does this come in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m42s)

[from could be all of them at least one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m46s)

[okay that's fair that's fair um so let](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m48s)

[me look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m51s)

[at these guys file type files to upload](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m53s)

[because at the end of the day if this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m57s)

[guy comes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h02m59s)

[through](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m01s)

[boom Oh I don't know if you've seen this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m03s)

[this kind of dirty trick here for for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m05s)

[eaching over two](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m08s)

[variables that's one of my favorite](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m11s)

[tricks](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m13s)

[I like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m14s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m15s)

[um cuz these ones won't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m17s)

[be like those are fair like that has to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m21s)

[be a file type of not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m24s)

[empty](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m29s)

[um cuz that pulls it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m33s)

[back that converts the strings into a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m38s)

[tupal where it is here](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m41s)

[this Con](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m44s)

[cats this one into](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m45s)

[here this filters out the original ones](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m48s)

[where the path contains portable](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h03m55s)

[zip like there's no I don't see a logic](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m08s)

[air there where where one of of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m11s)

[them okay so if the file type value](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m15s)

[coming in is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m18s)

[fine and this should be the generated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m31s)

[enom right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m34s)

[yeah leas installer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m36s)

[where where do you get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m47s)

[put so let's see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m49s)

[here yeah so this is putting in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h04m56s)

[query string oh oh I think you're right](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m00s)

[yeah it's explicitly not going to pull](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m05s)

[it from the query string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m07s)

[I I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m17s)

[mean so here's the thing I could fight](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m18s)

[with n](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m20s)

[swag or or I could do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m22s)

[that I bet you that is exactly what's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m29s)

[going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m32s)

[on okay let's test this let's test this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m33s)

[this is the internal ones I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m43s)

[believe](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m48s)

[uh oh this is update release where is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m56s)

[upload delete get must be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h05m59s)

[here upload](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m03s)

[release this one okay so we're going to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m08s)

[do](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m11s)

[this uh uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m12s)

[with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m16s)

[uh data on query](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m19s)

[string and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m25s)

[then so rather than putting this in](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m28s)

[here we want to get rid of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m33s)

[this yep and we want to do this is going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m36s)

[to go like this and what we want to is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m40s)

[we want to specify it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m43s)

[here right so let's go and make sure I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m46s)

[get this right let's doing release group](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m49s)

[ID first followed by file type okay](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m52s)

[release group ID goes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m57s)

[there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h06m59s)

[and need to interpolate](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m03s)

[this release group](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m08s)

[ID and then it is doing](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m10s)

[here file type](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m15s)

[equals file](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m18s)

[type](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m22s)

[okay Bippity boity](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m25s)

[booya I love my test](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m40s)

[come](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m51s)

[on green okay now I just want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m53s)

[verify I I prefer red than green so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h07m58s)

[let's let's we'll do it in reverse](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m01s)

[though let's verify that that attribute](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m03s)

[change is what actually fixes it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m06s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m12s)

[so you should be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m13s)

[red show me two failures one two](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m15s)

[failures and then if I put you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m19s)

[back boom](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m23s)

[save](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m33s)

[and two successes okay so that'll fix](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m37s)

[that and we can support both and then I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m42s)

[don't have to more importantly I don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m45s)

[have to go figure out how n swag's](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m47s)

[generating its crap and fix it I will](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m49s)

[just say if the values come in from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m53s)

[either place we're good actually I guess](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m55s)

[I should verify the test right above it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h08m58s)

[too make sure make sure we didn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h09m01s)

[break I want to okay so the API test the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h09m04s)

[API surface didn't change from that so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h09m07s)

[reasons Quest content](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h13m36s)

[type](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h13m39s)

[uh so](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h13m41s)

[might take](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h13m57s)

[precedence uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m01s)

[oh ca yeah so there so I I'll warn you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m16s)

[with datetime do now there are there are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m20s)

[problems depending on what your target](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m24s)

[framework is um when you're running](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m26s)

[against it some of those tests only work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m29s)

[in NET Framework](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m32s)

[oret uh net 5. net 6 um because of how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m35s)

[the underlying Library works so the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m40s)

[thing to look](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m43s)

[at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m45s)

[uh this Library here and and honestly it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m48s)

[could be that nose plug just needs](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m52s)

[actually I think I have an update since](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m55s)

[I might have to double check it may just](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m57s)

[need an updated Harmony but Harmony is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h14m59s)

[functionally what makes nose plug work](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m01s)

[so it creates what's called a trampoline](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m04s)

[where it overrides the pointer in the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m06s)

[method table that way you can mock](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m09s)

[Statics](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m12s)

[like nose plug is one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m13s)

[of I don't know one of my worst](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m16s)

[inventions like it is really cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m19s)

[and always causes me grief one of my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m24s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m32s)

[um yeah Coop pilot the whole point](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m34s)

[is to not do it this way](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m39s)

[because it is multi-part form](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m48s)

[data](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m51s)

[uh it's just not](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m53s)

[supported](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h15m58s)

[well](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m04s)

[yeah that appears to be the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m05s)

[case and I can turn it off](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m10s)

[let me go back here I want to look at](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m15s)

[what the fact that it doesn't change the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m18s)

[open API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m23s)

[spec gives me a lot of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m25s)

[pause yeah no problem CA if if you can't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m29s)

[solve it feel free to reach out um with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m32s)

[uh a message on uh Discord or similar](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m36s)

[the other thing is try running it in uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m40s)

[from the console and you should see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m42s)

[everything get dumped out for you so if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m44s)

[it's with one of the tests just run net](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m46s)

[test at the solution and it should uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m48s)

[dump everything](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m51s)

[out because where okay so this is the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h16m55s)

[quick uh](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m20s)

[well this is this is why I think I've](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m30s)

[missed them is because I don't actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m32s)

[generate the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m35s)

[stream I generate a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m36s)

[redirect which generates a stream](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m38s)

[but that's not in the well we know how](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m43s)

[it's going to redirect](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m48s)

[so that will be](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h21m49s)

[passes](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m10s)

[because if it passes because this one](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m11s)

[should generate if it's done the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m14s)

[appropriate thing we should see a change](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m17s)

[in the open API](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m18s)

[so three additions octet stream string](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m33s)

[binary yeah okay so we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m40s)

[can that is probably](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h22m43s)

[chance this cup might be too](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h26m54s)

[big it's a small chance but there is a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h26m57s)

[chance I want to see this thing actually](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m01s)

[go out and work first and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m03s)

[then that will probably so that should](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m07s)

[fix your your at least the first](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m10s)

[rolling](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m19s)

[okay and then feel free if you don't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m23s)

[like any of the commits that I did on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m26s)

[here I wasn't sure when you were going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m28s)

[to be back I have trouble counting days](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m30s)

[with different time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m32s)

[zones](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m33s)

[um let see uh delete](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m35s)

[file so if there's anything in here that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m38s)

[is problematic or you disagree with or](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m41s)

[whatnot I did like the change on this um](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m43s)

[one question I did](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m47s)

[have so we've got we've got a weird](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m49s)

[setup going on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m53s)

[here I assume we're intending to keep](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m56s)

[net six for now since it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h27m58s)

[is like when does it drop out of](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m02s)

[support like there there's there's some](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m05s)

[interesting bits here the other thing is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m07s)

[we could probably bump our Lang version](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m09s)

[up since we're targeting net n like to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m11s)

[compile this you're going to need the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m14s)

[net 9](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m16s)

[SDK so like we can go](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m17s)

[bigger if we want this thing bigger like](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m20s)

[this won't change the consumers it'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m23s)

[only change what tooling we use on](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m24s)

[ours](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m28s)

[uh cause some issues on NET](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m30s)

[Framework](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m33s)

[really you have me you have me](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m37s)

[intrigued now I want to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m41s)

[see what issues I know there's things](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m44s)

[like if you use some of the newer](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m48s)

[features for like range and index it'll](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m49s)

[it'll squawk at you but that's only if](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m52s)

[you use](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m55s)

[them and you can't always polyfill them](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h28m57s)

[in because I'm guessing what you're](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m01s)

[saying is is if you use some of those](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m03s)

[newer features you get bit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m06s)

[because if it is just things like range](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m16s)

[and index and those types of things yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m18s)

[you po F inste if you use them got it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m20s)

[okay well I'll undo this for now and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m23s)

[then we can come back and see how it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m27s)

[works I didn't spend a lot of time](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m31s)

[checking these ones here I just assumed](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m33s)

[that they were more or less correct the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m36s)

[other thing that I liked about this is](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m39s)

[because I'm going to get bit trying to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m41s)

[fix that issue with publish inside a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m43s)

[visual studio because inside a visual](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m46s)

[studio it's going to be using NET](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m49s)

[Framework and it's going to require a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m51s)

[strong uh a strong name on the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m53s)

[assembly so I was going to look and](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h29m57s)

[see how like initially it](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m00s)

[was not necessarily our assemblies that](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m05s)

[were just the problematic ones but also](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m08s)

[our dependencies because you have a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m10s)

[strong name it has to propagate all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m12s)

[way down and so we were going to end up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m15s)

[having to add names to all the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m18s)

[dependencies and I was potentially going](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m19s)

[to look at splitting things up just to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m21s)

[limit](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m23s)

[my blast radius into what it ended up](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m25s)

[needing to be so having this separated](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m28s)

[out I think will make my life easier I](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m32s)

[think for for](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m35s)

[build um but I I'll wait till this](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m37s)

[merges and then and then I'll see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m41s)

[because it's GNA suck regardless but](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m43s)

[there as far as I could tell there isn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m46s)

[an easy workaround well there's two](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m48s)

[options option one is we do the strong](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m50s)

[name](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m54s)

[stuff uh and deal with the Fallout from](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m55s)

[that option two is rather than starting](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h30m57s)

[and using a custom Ms build task you](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m02s)

[just invoke a CLI the thing with the CLI](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m05s)

[is you then have to make sure that the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m08s)

[CLI has the needed runtime which isn't](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m09s)

[necessarily guaranteed to be there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m12s)

[either so it's like but we kind of are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m14s)

[already telling people that they have to](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m16s)

[have the VPK CLI so we could kind of get](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m17s)

[with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m20s)

[it but we give up like good progress](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m23s)

[reporting and some of the stuff there](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m26s)

[it's like ah I don't like any of my](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m28s)

[options](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m32s)

[uh let's see uh for the lowest one we](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m34s)

[can support which are still in support](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m38s)

[that six is out of support but a lower](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m41s)

[version we can support](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m43s)

[meaningfully lots of new async fancy](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m45s)

[extensions we use got it okay yeah](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m47s)

[that's fine I'm I'm good with](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m50s)

[it okay cool](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h31m56s)

[want to hang around long enough to rerun](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h32m13s)

[about its](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h33m11s)

[life deploying background services are](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h33m12s)

[going for anybody who wants to see](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h33m16s)

[doing things see our back end has got a](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h33m20s)

[much simpler pipeline than the](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h33m23s)

[front because it doesn't have like all](https://youtu.be/2maz0z8xrOY?t=04h33m25s)
