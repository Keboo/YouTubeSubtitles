[okay welcome everyone this week we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m22s)



[going to do something a little different](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m25s)



[than what we normally do this is going](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m26s)



[to be a stream with a couple co-workers](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m28s)



[of mine grant Erickson who is the CTO](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m31s)



[dantella tech and then Andrew Scott who](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m34s)



[is one of the local and principal lead](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m37s)



[developers on the coalesce project so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m39s)



[last week I'd kind of briefly mentioned](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m42s)



[it sort of in passing and people seem to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m45s)



[be interested in it so we are going to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m46s)



[dive in and see what they have so since](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m48s)



[this is not my area of expertise I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m52s)



[gonna let them basically show off how](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m53s)



[awesome it is and let them go so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h05m56s)



[gentlemen let me switch over and away](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m00s)



[you go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m04s)



[grant Andrew welcome thank you for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m04s)



[coming and putting up with me hey so if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m06s)



[you're only seeing grant that's expected](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m11s)



[Andrew is having camera problems but he](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m14s)



[his is the screen that's driving so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m18s)



[grant is there anything else that you'd](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m21s)



[like to introduce yourself I'm Aiman](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h06m23s)



[then I am tired of writing drop and I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m12s)



[tired of grace when I drop Redrum down](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m14s)



[kids wanted Richard sup I like to write](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m16s)



[like polar ice all of it'll stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m24s)



[right old please settle somewhere I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m27s)



[sorry love really loved you nine nine](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m29s)



[rubato run and run and use hundred games](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m32s)



[talking like that but things like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m36s)



[but after a while I had my controls and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m37s)



[controls and all of these different all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m45s)



[of these different systems so that Park](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m46s)



[up ballpark up boring and we came up to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m48s)



[a project maboob project we're have to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m50s)



[build at the build a an application](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m52s)



[application I guess that was this one](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h07m56s)



[from the personality so a person](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m08s)



[together come together come together to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m17s)



[Andrews so andrew has so while I kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m31s)



[kicked off coalesce Andrews really been](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m33s)



[one of the primary developers on it for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m35s)



[the past few years and initially the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m36s)



[software was designed to be run at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m39s)



[knockout because that's kind of the land](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m42s)



[where we started and then after that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m44s)



[we've moved on so hey what should week](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m47s)



[and what kind of fits and we've really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m49s)



[found that that view is really the best](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m50s)



[food so when you and we do things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m52s)



[tonight you're gonna knock out us some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m54s)



[of the older apps we've written with it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m56s)



[toys supports that really a simple data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h08m58s)



[binding process if you want to do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m00s)



[something like that although I think at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m03s)



[this point you'd recommend using](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m04s)



[something like to you which is more of a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m05s)



[spa piece but it's not quite so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m08s)



[opinionated as things like angular so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m11s)



[anyway Andrew do you want to say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m14s)



[anything to kind of kick yourself yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m16s)



[no I I think that's actually a great](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m18s)



[place to start talking along the lines](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m20s)



[of talking about view and knock out in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m23s)



[different web frameworks and kind of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m25s)



[choices that we made you know making](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m27s)



[goal isn't picking the the web front-end](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m31s)



[frameworks to based on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m34s)



[you know knockout you know of course](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m37s)



[what was the first choice not that was a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m39s)



[great option and a great solution for us](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m41s)



[there for a long time but it just kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m43s)



[of didn't it hasn't aged very well you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m45s)



[know it's kind of everybody's just sort](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m48s)



[of moved on didn't want a new masters](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m51s)



[nobody's really making nobody's really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h09m56s)



[making cool stuff for knockout and more](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m00s)



[cool components or anything like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m02s)



[but but view is it is a great a great](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m06s)



[spiritual successor to knockout when you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m14s)



[when you put it in comparison with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m17s)



[angular and when you compare it with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m20s)



[react kind of the way that view works](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m22s)



[fundamentally with tracking reactivity](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m26s)



[is very similar to the way that knockout](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m28s)



[does that of course knockout does it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m31s)



[with observables which are these](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m32s)



[functions that you have to call either](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m34s)



[it's call it with no arguments to get a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m36s)



[value out of it or call it as an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m39s)



[argument to give a value to it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m40s)



[you kind of does that all under the hood](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m43s)



[for you so you don't have all this you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m45s)



[know stuff and your code is littered](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m47s)



[with parentheses everywhere you turn](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m49s)



[well yeah I love those yeah so so so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m51s)



[that's kind of you know and we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h10m58s)



[looking at at front-end frameworks and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m00s)



[this will this will kind of all make a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m03s)



[lot more sense as we get more into what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m05s)



[colas is and how to use it but that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m07s)



[the way we want with you as opposed to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m12s)



[say angular or react for this right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m14s)



[there that's great the the real idea](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m19s)



[here is that we want it to take and put](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m22s)



[the fun stuff back in and so essentially](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m24s)



[you write a data model and then it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m28s)



[builds out all the stuff up to your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m30s)



[front-end it builds your API layers and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m32s)



[all that and we can we should pipe](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m34s)



[through a little picture here let's kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m35s)



[of we have a few slides let's just go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m37s)



[through the slides we're going that way](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m38s)



[don't forget stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m39s)



[let's pop to the next one if you would](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m41s)



[Andrew okay so what do mr. Hart we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m42s)



[talked about that what does it do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m46s)



[so same](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m49s)



[it's like let's do the fun stuff let's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m51s)



[do the stuff where we have to think](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m52s)



[let's do the pieces where we really have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m54s)



[to put our creativity into the process](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m56s)



[and the parts that where we don't know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h11m58s)



[think as much like building out parts of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m00s)



[the API service like for example if I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m03s)



[going to build a drop-down that allows](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m05s)



[me to search and select an object from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m07s)



[somewhere else my object model to link](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m09s)



[in as a foreign key for my database I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m11s)



[mean that can be a fair amount of code](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m13s)



[to build that piece of that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m16s)



[that'ss that code that does that the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m18s)



[actual functionality can be difficult](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m21s)



[and so it builds out the API controllers](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m23s)



[and things like that and so what what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m25s)



[knock out really try store that would](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m28s)



[knock out what coalesce really tries to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m30s)



[do is allow you this builds out those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m32s)



[pieces so it builds dto so data transfer](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m35s)



[object so the objects on the client side](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m38s)



[that are typically all mobile properties](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m40s)



[and things like that it does all your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m43s)



[security checking and security trimming](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m45s)



[in and out it builds typescript models](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m47s)



[and the view models for all your objects](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m49s)



[and lists you can really easily do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m52s)



[things on the client with your data and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m53s)



[then it builds a set of admin views](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m55s)



[because we found that almost every app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m57s)



[we wrote we needed some way to go in and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h12m59s)



[just look through the database behind it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m02s)



[and and really just a caveat coalesce is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m04s)



[really designed for and not renesis le](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m08s)



[forms over data but database back-end](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m10s)



[web front-end if you're doing something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m13s)



[else there's probably other tools that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m16s)



[are better and even if you're doing this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m18s)



[there may be tools that are better thing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m20s)



[coalesce it's good for certain things we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m22s)



[found that for a line of business](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m24s)



[applications and things like that it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m25s)



[works great](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m27s)



[and these admin views are basically just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m27s)



[a way to say hey I for every table in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m29s)



[the database I need to be able to see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m32s)



[them and filter them sort them be able](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m34s)



[to page through my data search for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m37s)



[different things and have that all be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m39s)



[really easy and just built right out of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m40s)



[the box for you so and then some helpers](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m43s)



[to be able to do nice easy bindings to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m45s)



[get drop-down lists and different kinds](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m48s)



[of of nice stuff that you would use just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m50s)



[in your application so you can get more](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m52s)



[to building your app and building your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m54s)



[data models and building your classes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m57s)



[and building custom interfaces and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h13m59s)



[things like that and spend less time](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m00s)



[doing a lot of boiler](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m02s)



[which unfortunately in the state that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m03s)



[were in right now if you want to write a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m06s)



[website I would say at least 50% of what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m08s)



[you're doing is what I would consider](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m10s)



[blue boilerplate work which is just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m11s)



[plumbing things from the server to the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m13s)



[client and from the client to the server](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m16s)



[so I guess is there a little picture too](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m18s)



[becomes up next Andrew do you want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m21s)



[add anything to that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m23s)



[there sure is no I think that's a great](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m24s)



[summary of it I just talked about all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m27s)



[the stuff on the slide so it should be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m30s)



[pretty easy and there's quite a bit on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m31s)



[this slide here too so I'm gonna just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m34s)



[make sure that I that I've got this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m36s)



[straight so for people who are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m38s)



[unfamiliar I am NOT a great web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m40s)



[developer I think both grant and Andrew](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m42s)



[will agree with that statement when I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m45s)



[when I say that so just to be clear so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m46s)



[when we're talking about going through](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m50s)



[this it's the the new build up at the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m52s)



[top right so it's I I get to pick the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m55s)



[layout of my site my styling how my you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h14m58s)



[know typescript or view code works right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m01s)



[and then ultimately reacts and work our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m04s)



[way out of the bottom why don't you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m07s)



[start down there first work your way so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m09s)



[let's start at the bottom](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m11s)



[I build out my entity framework](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m12s)



[dbcontext I build out my various entity](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m14s)



[pocos right lay those out yep all right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m17s)



[Koko's and you know you can even put](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m22s)



[functions on your poker if I have a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m24s)



[function that does something and all of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m28s)



[your functions and methods and things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m29s)



[like that will be extended if you want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m31s)



[extend it out to the client so you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m34s)



[call it okay client and so then it it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m36s)



[going to generate the the c-sharp web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m38s)



[api s-- for me and all of those things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m40s)



[so i don't need to worry about building](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m42s)



[the the dt OS for the transfer on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m43s)



[wire down to the client right and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m46s)



[he generates all of the typescript](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m50s)



[clients so very like Swaggart client](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m52s)



[auto Jen asked I I assume in that area](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m55s)



[right except except a little more than I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h15m58s)



[mean it's you're gonna get more because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m02s)



[they're a lot more they're a lot more](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m06s)



[intelligent they're they're more](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m08s)



[specific to it to kind of a crud](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m10s)



[situation so it the view models in this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m13s)



[case are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m16s)



[are stateful objects they're kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m17s)



[aware of of things like foreign key](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m19s)



[relationships and they're aware that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m21s)



[they can be saved and that they can be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m24s)



[deleted and that they can be related to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m26s)



[other things so it so it's not just you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m28s)



[know simply a method that wraps an API](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m31s)



[endpoint it's also it's an object with a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m35s)



[bunch of methods that wrap API endpoints](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m38s)



[but also a lot of other used as well so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m40s)



[now there is just hey let's wrap the API](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m45s)



[endpoint that's that's a layer as well](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m47s)



[but there's also this layer of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m49s)



[statefulness on your client so I can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m51s)



[basically instantiate let's say a list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m53s)



[object that one can put in some filter](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m56s)



[criteria into a property and then say go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h16m59s)



[get that stuff and it will load in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m01s)



[whatever first page that I've specified](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m03s)



[if I then go in and modify one of those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m06s)



[entities it can automatically save that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m09s)



[back to the database via an API call so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m12s)



[again and all this stuff can be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m14s)



[configured however you want it but the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m15s)



[idea is that I can really easily grab](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m17s)



[data from the server throw it on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m20s)



[screen and whatever kind of format I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m22s)



[want and then have the user interact](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m24s)



[with that data and have things be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m27s)



[automatically saved and updated in a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m28s)



[pretty dynamic fashion and not have to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m31s)



[worry about that stuff no again you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m33s)



[worry about it if you want and you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m34s)



[turn off some of the automatic things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m36s)



[but in general it just kind of works try](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m37s)



[to make that that easy path pretty easy](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m41s)



[and that you want to do it that's okay](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m45s)



[so then the last thing I guess my](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m48s)



[question would be is that you build on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m49s)



[the left side there with the view models](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m51s)



[and business logic so what what am i](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m54s)



[building out there all right yes all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m56s)



[right that's a great question so when](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h17m59s)



[you think about your database you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m01s)



[going to have your pocos and your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m02s)



[contacts and all the things around that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m04s)



[but then the question is well where do I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m07s)



[actually put my business logic if I want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m08s)



[let's say to send an email well how do I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m10s)



[do that that's not you don't want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m13s)



[build up like an email object and save](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m15s)



[it in the database you want to call a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m17s)



[method that says send an email and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m19s)



[here's the two in the front and the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m21s)



[whatever you're gonna do right whatever](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m22s)



[process that is and so there's the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m25s)



[ability to build up not only logic on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m26s)



[your pocos](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m29s)



[but you can also build up logic in other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m30s)



[parts of your application and expose](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m34s)



[that logic out to the client through API](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m36s)



[automatically so for example if I had](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m38s)



[some kind of method let's say that does](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m40s)



[send an email and it had a certain](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m42s)



[number of properties and it had a return](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m44s)



[value I can specify for Co less to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m45s)



[extend that out build me out an API for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m48s)



[that build out a view model for that and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m50s)



[then provide all of the calls that I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m53s)



[would need to be able to call it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m55s)



[asynchronously so I could call it and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m56s)



[then get statuses back and get a call](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h18m58s)



[back when the actual returns or all the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m00s)



[error handling and be able to find a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m04s)



[little spinners on the screen to be able](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m06s)



[to know that hey this thing is still](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m08s)



[being called so essentially all that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m10s)



[stuff you want to be able to do to make](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m12s)



[that asynchronous call that stuff all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m13s)



[gets wrapped in this nice class for you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m16s)



[that allows you to do that with without](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m18s)



[a lot of fuss and unfortunately making](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m21s)



[an asynchronous call across between](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m24s)



[client and server actually printed on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m27s)



[post a client server is difficult I mean](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m29s)



[there's just a lot of plumbing to do it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m32s)



[what I would kind of turn right you have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m34s)



[to have a lot of things to account for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m36s)



[all the use cases that you end up in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m37s)



[there so so really writing your business](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m39s)



[logic which is the core thing outside of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m41s)



[your data model save your data model and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m44s)



[then you have all the business logic](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m46s)



[that's going to work on that and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m47s)



[any other view models that you have for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m49s)



[example if let's say you don't want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m52s)



[project the data to the client like it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m54s)



[is in your your actual data context you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m57s)



[want to add essentially another layer](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h19m59s)



[over the top of that but maybe diamonte](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m01s)



[normalizes or Optimus Cades or or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m03s)



[somehow provides the data in a format](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m05s)



[that is better for your application all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m08s)



[that stuff can totally be done and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m09s)



[the the application really doesn't work](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m11s)



[on your or maybe on all of your data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m13s)



[context classes but would work on your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m15s)



[view models instead and those things can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m18s)



[really easily work back and forth and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m20s)



[have a lot of the same features and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m22s)



[functionality as we get out of our DTS](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m25s)



[so it just gives a lot of flexibility to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m27s)



[either go directly off of your data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m30s)



[model things in your context off of like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m32s)



[essentially services that you can write](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m36s)



[out for business logic or off of a whole](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m37s)



[new set of view models and if you want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m39s)



[to write new sets of view models you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m41s)



[also write new sets of D tos and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m42s)



[so all of the things that it builds for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m44s)



[you can also go in and extend and change](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m46s)



[because for example inside the DTO is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m48s)



[where all the security trimming and so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m51s)



[you can go in and see exactly how we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m53s)



[going to security trim based on user and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m55s)



[so you can annotate and most of this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h20m57s)



[all done with annotations on your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m00s)



[classes whether those are business or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m02s)



[whether those are your objects in your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m04s)



[context or in your services or your view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m06s)



[models you annotate them and that then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m08s)



[controls what gets exposed out to the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m10s)



[client it does so help definitely an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m13s)



[amateur like myself okay carry on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m17s)



[yeah whatever](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m22s)



[and or you want to talk about meeting](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m24s)



[one here I mean we could we kind of talk](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m25s)



[about it for a fair amount carat maybe](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m32s)



[you know some of these are actually kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m33s)



[of old desert some of these are based on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m43s)



[the knockout stack yeah there's been a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m45s)



[few changes to that that's probably all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m48s)



[covered most of it anyway so yeah that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m51s)



[pretty boring so if we want to go ahead](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h21m54s)



[and start a new project with coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m00s)



[the first thing that we're gonna gonna](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m03s)



[do is go out your taskbar to the bottom](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m05s)



[where everywhere all normal people keep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m09s)



[it so the first thing I want to do is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m10s)



[come out to coalesce on github so github](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m25s)



[calm slash and teletext it's a slash](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m28s)



[coalesce this is a great place to get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m30s)



[started we have all the links here to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m34s)



[not only the templates this is also the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m37s)



[the entire repo of coalesce itself](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m40s)



[Andrews did a great job of building](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m46s)



[documentation this is almost entirely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m48s)



[him building all this stuff out so all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m50s)



[the docs you see he gets all the props](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m52s)



[for that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m54s)



[speaking of the documentation here's the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h22m58s)



[link to the documentation so we have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m00s)



[coalesced Reba Docs I oh there there is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m02s)



[also a site coalesced until tech comm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m06s)



[that's sort of a demo of a really simple](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m09s)



[demo app of the knock out stack it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m12s)



[it's kind of out of date at this point](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m15s)



[we kind of need to build anyone probably](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m17s)



[with you but yeah maybe tonight but this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m19s)



[site so this is all of the documentation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m29s)



[for colas this includes things like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m31s)



[getting started pages here we have some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m33s)



[overview pages if you want to learn](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m37s)



[about the different stacks you know view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m38s)



[is the one we're gonna be focusing on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m41s)



[here tonight if you do want to go learn](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m42s)



[about the knockout stack have at it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m45s)



[so the view stack for colas I'll just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m51s)



[really quickly go over this that it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m54s)



[better to show not tell but I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m56s)



[tell you here for a minute it is built](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h23m58s)



[into four different layers so the first](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m01s)



[and most base layer is the metadata](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m03s)



[layer so this is just a set of static](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m05s)



[data about your data model that is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m09s)



[available to you at runtime on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m11s)



[client so in the browser just things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m13s)



[like hey what are all the properties of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m16s)



[this type what are their names is this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m17s)



[one a foreign key okay if it's a foreign](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m20s)



[key what is it a foreign key - things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m22s)



[like that that just help us build out](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m24s)



[input controls and things like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m28s)



[dynamically at runtime and so you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m29s)



[you can use the metadata yourself and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m34s)



[you in your own code chances are you'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m37s)



[never really interact with it it's just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m38s)



[kind of there and it serves the other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m41s)



[three layers I'm the next one being the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m43s)



[model layer which is really simple it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m45s)



[just a set of interfaces that described](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m47s)



[your data model so these are typescript](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m50s)



[interfaces they don't come with any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m52s)



[functionality they just basically exist](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m53s)



[as types this this also includes enums](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h24m58s)



[as well are generated as typescript](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m01s)



[enums](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m03s)



[the next layer up is the API client so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m05s)



[this is a set of stateless classes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m08s)



[that just wrap endpoints so this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m11s)



[similar to what you might get if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m13s)



[were to run a swagger generator against](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m16s)



[a swagger document generated for your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m18s)



[asp net core site or whatever site](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m21s)



[doesn't have to be asp net core so the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m23s)



[api client is just a set of classes with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m27s)



[stateless methods that you can call the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m29s)



[invoke web request and then the fourth](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m32s)



[and final layer is the view model layer](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m34s)



[here and this is kind of where all the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m36s)



[magic happens these are the stateful](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m37s)



[objects these provide you know saves and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m40s)



[deletes on a per object basis these are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m46s)



[the lists that do things like paging and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m49s)



[searching and sorting and filtering](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m51s)



[these this is the the place where you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m54s)



[gonna be interacting with coalesce 95%](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h25m57s)



[of the time when you're building an app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m01s)



[with coalescing with view we also have a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m02s)



[set of components so these are view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m11s)



[components built on the beautify library](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m14s)



[so those of you who frequent kevin's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m17s)



[stream will be familiar with material](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m19s)



[design and that would be correct you get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m23s)



[extra points for getting that right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m26s)



[beautify is similarly a material design](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m30s)



[library in view and JavaScript well in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m33s)



[typescript actually provides a huge](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m38s)



[number of components lots of really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m42s)



[awesome stuff and so what we've done is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m45s)



[kind of built out a layer of components](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m47s)



[for coalesce that kind of ties you defi](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m49s)



[into your coalesce data model so you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m53s)



[do really simple things like hey give me](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m55s)



[an input for this property and and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h26m57s)



[coalesce notice oh that's a that's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m00s)



[foreign key so I'm gonna give you a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m03s)



[drop-down that presents you with a list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m05s)



[of all the valid objects that you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m07s)



[use to assign a key to this foreign key](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m09s)



[or this is a string so I'm gonna give](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m12s)



[you your text box or things like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m14s)



[so what we want to do is get started](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m20s)



[with you so this is also linked to from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m23s)



[the home page of the coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m27s)



[documentation this link down here also](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m28s)



[over here in the sidebar getting started](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m32s)



[with you so what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m34s)



[use the dotnet new template that we've](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m40s)



[created which is going to give us an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m43s)



[out-of-the-box project what's kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m44s)



[all the configuration files set up for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m46s)



[us so this is gonna have all your NPM](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m49s)



[packages are there your kind of based](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m51s)



[out of new get packages that you need](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m53s)



[are there your project structure is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m55s)



[there what do I need to have before I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h27m57s)



[get started with this so all you really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m01s)



[need is is the dotnet SDK preferably 3.1](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m04s)



[although you know 2.1 or 2.2 are gonna](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m09s)



[work just fine for you as well actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m14s)



[in the in the latest version 2.1 might](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m17s)



[not work but 2.2 and 3.1 will definitely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m21s)



[work you're gonna wat node installed and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m24s)



[that's gonna give you your your building](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m28s)



[of your view project so you know view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m32s)



[projects at least in the way that we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m34s)



[using them as a spa you don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m36s)



[necessarily have to use view as a spa](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m39s)



[but that certainly how we've we've](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m40s)



[designed it to be used with coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m42s)



[that's gonna allow you to build that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m44s)



[that's also gonna bring along NPM so you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m46s)



[can install your NPM packages failing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m49s)



[that you don't really need anything else](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m52s)



[although I highly recommend Visual](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m56s)



[Studio code with the veteran install so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h28m59s)



[that's V et you are that's the official](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m03s)



[view extension well not it's not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m09s)



[actually official or maybe it's official](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m11s)



[now I can't remember if they kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m13s)



[adopted that but that is just kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m14s)



[the gold standard set of view tooling](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m20s)



[for Visual Studio code I've also had](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m22s)



[other people and at Intel attacked have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m25s)



[great success with JetBrains webstorm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m27s)



[for working with you projects I haven't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m31s)



[personally used it but they seem to have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m34s)



[had pretty good success Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m36s)



[has pretty basic support for view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m40s)



[projects and specifically views single](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m44s)



[file components which will we'll take a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m47s)



[look at in a minute what those are and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m49s)



[what those do for you but but it's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m51s)



[little bit lacking and so my personal](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m55s)



[preference the way I usually build](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h29m58s)



[projects with coalescing with view is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m00s)



[that I use vias code for all my](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m04s)



[front-end development and I keep Visual](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m06s)



[Studio open for all my back-end](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m08s)



[development just because I'm I'm well](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m10s)



[set in my ways of using Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m13s)



[for all my writing c-sharp but you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m15s)



[certainly don't have to use that if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m19s)



[like to use because code or you like you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m20s)



[something else you know you open as many](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m22s)



[IDs at once as you as you want these are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m24s)



[just how I personally prefer to do it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m28s)



[and the workflow actually works fairly](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m31s)



[well because you're building this stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m33s)



[on the back end and your database stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m36s)



[your business classes and things like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m37s)



[that and then once you then run to less](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m39s)



[and generate that middle tier you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m41s)



[then basically just iterate really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m44s)



[quickly on your front-end and you're not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m46s)



[stopping and starting it's just because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m48s)



[using webpack and all that it just kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m50s)



[of works so it's it's not that clunky to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m53s)



[do go back and forth it again you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m57s)



[you do it however you want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h30m59s)



[well cuz you mentioned getting note](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m02s)



[installed what version of node does it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m06s)



[matter latest and greatest latest and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m08s)



[greatest that's gonna serve you well I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m12s)



[and and specifically I'd recommend not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m15s)



[going to oath because it probably won't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m17s)



[serve you - well I mean if you're within](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m20s)



[a few a major version or two it is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m21s)



[probably gonna be just fine but if I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m25s)



[need to rep my versions what I will say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m27s)



[so i'm or newer 9 is also definitely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m30s)



[fine what I will say is be wary](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m39s)



[you know Visual Studio comes with a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m42s)



[really old version of node bundled with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m45s)



[it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m47s)



[very wary of using that or if you ever](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m48s)



[find yourself in a context where that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m51s)



[might be getting used for example the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m53s)



[visual studio package manager console](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m55s)



[will prioritize on its path the version](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h31m57s)



[of node that Visual Studio comes bundled](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m01s)



[with and you'll find yourself very](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m03s)



[quickly running into all sorts of really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m05s)



[arcane errors and you'll you'll just be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m07s)



[horribly confused at why you're getting](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m09s)



[these errors because you definitely have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m13s)



[noted version tenants all except the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m15s)



[visual studio is injecting its own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m18s)



[really a wedding doubt run from the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m20s)



[command line to make sure that I'm not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m22s)



[getting bit by extra visual studio stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m23s)



[and check my path yeah do it yet search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m26s)



[for NPM and options and you can go in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m31s)



[and find the external web tools and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m33s)



[get those straight and get the node yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m35s)



[you can reorganize those individuals](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m38s)



[video so you can reprioritize them on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m40s)



[your path gotcha cool yep the key openko](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m43s)



[that's they're just background even](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m55s)



[though that's not actually what we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m58s)



[gonna be doing here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h32m59s)



[we're gonna meet making a new project no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m00s)



[visual sitio doesn't want to go away](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m03s)



[yeah it wants to prepare the solution of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m05s)



[course alright so oops it came back so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m07s)

[new template is is make a new directory](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m18s)



[for it I think what we're gonna build](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m20s)



[here is just a really simple to do app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m24s)



[because who doesn't want another to-do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m26s)

[tag him and get him on this stream too](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m38s)



[we got enough smart people at Intel](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m40s)



[attack we got a sucker min as easy as](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m43s)



[much as I can we make that bigger that I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m46s)



[did I just press ctrl+ and it just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m51s)



[worked thanks thanks Windows Terminal](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m54s)



[ooh you're being about time something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m56s)



[simple like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h33m58s)



[so now we're receded into our new app so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m03s)



[we're gonna say I couldn't I guess I can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m06s)



[zoom that to make that bigger - we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m09s)



[gonna make sure that we have the latest](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m11s)



[version of the template installed so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m13s)



[we're just gonna do a dotnet new install](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m15s)



[tell chuckles view template I might](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m16s)

[sure and Andrew should they use the like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m24s)



[full versions or so they go for the the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m28s)



[beta versions right now the the template](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m30s)



[doesn't have beta or full versions the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m33s)



[templates are all just only on nougat](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h34m35s)

[your user management you wouldn't use](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m01s)



[this class you would use the ones that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m03s)



[come from identity there's some stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m05s)



[that you can do I don't know that we'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m09s)



[get into it tonight but there's some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m11s)



[stuff that you can do so you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m12s)



[actually manage your asp net core](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m13s)



[identity entities with coalesce and so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m15s)



[you can use the colas admin pages with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m18s)



[those you couldn't have to set up an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m20s)



[inheritance hierarchy with those classes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m24s)



[and and kind of annotate some of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m27s)



[properties in certain ways to secure](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m29s)

[the password hash field you know after](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m33s)



[the client willingly is that covered in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m37s)



[the docs to the injury since I know we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m40s)



[probably won't get there tonight is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m42s)



[there one of them that isn't covered](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m43s)



[then maybe I'll have to pay me back for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m47s)



[that later if nothing else from my own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m49s)



[project yeah or we could write it in the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m50s)



[Docs because it is a common common](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m55s)



[scenario don't want to do is to bring it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h38m56s)



[yeah yeah there's basically you have the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m00s)



[identity whether you're in the database](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m03s)



[you have identity using Active Directory](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m05s)



[and then you have some kind of third](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m07s)



[party off those are the kind of I guess](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m09s)



[the big ones because if it wasn't clear](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m11s)



[I've got my own personal project that I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m21s)



[want to use coalesce for and so I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m23s)



[going to make sure I can take full](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m26s)



[advantage of it I don't know how many](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m29s)



[projects we've use this for internally](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m34s)



[but we must be up to a dozen or more and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m35s)



[then I know there's other people using](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m37s)



[it too I don't know how many of those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m39s)



[are but it's been great I think on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m40s)



[average what it saves us summer between](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m45s)



[50 and 60% 70% it may be at the best](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m49s)



[time wise mm-hmm yeah I think it's fair](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m53s)



[so here it is open and oh it's a consume](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h39m58s)



[that part of it here it is open in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m07s)



[Visual Studio as I was saying so what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m08s)



[what you'll get here for managing the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m12s)



[version of colas I just want to touch on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m15s)



[this quickly is I use a an MS build](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m16s)



[variable here called coalesce version](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m20s)



[the reason I do this is because the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m22s)



[colas cogeneration tool is a dotnet CLI](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m24s)



[tool and the NuGet package manager and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m28s)



[visual city](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m31s)



[does not support versioning of dotnet](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m32s)



[CLI tool references and so what you'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m34s)



[find is you'll go and then you'll try to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m37s)



[use the new get package manager and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m38s)



[Visual Studio to version 2 bump a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m40s)



[version of coalesce and it'll leave this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m42s)



[one behind and then your versions won't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m44s)



[match and things will be unhappy so this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m46s)



[is managed by a directory build props](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m50s)



[file in the solution where we define the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h40m55s)



[coalesced version so that's as it was](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m00s)



[mentioning earlier that's the latest](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m02s)



[alpha version right there Kevin you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m03s)



[what there was that and make tools now](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m07s)



[they're getting rid of dunder is there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m12s)



[any is there any open issue for that or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m14s)



[not I like I know the nougat team is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m18s)



[slammed with a whole bunch of stuff yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m19s)



[I don't remember seeing this on their](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m21s)



[roadmap but if it's if it doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m22s)



[we should probably make it exist it is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m25s)



[and essentially what they've said is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m32s)



[they're getting rid of it doesn't it's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m34s)

[at all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m51s)



[okay I might I might have to message](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m53s)



[Kathleen and then get us on a call we'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m55s)



[have a chat there's a there that there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h41m58s)



[a different issue somewhere around here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m02s)



[that is specific to the issue that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m05s)



[haven't coalesce I don't I don't have a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m07s)



[link to but I'm definitely subscribed it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m09s)



[I'm not signed in but I'm definitely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m10s)



[subscribed to it I don't think it's all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m12s)



[because like the anyway the command-line](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m17s)



[tools](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m20s)



[Kathleen dollard's the PM for the system](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m20s)



[command-line project as well so we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m24s)



[chat I'm wondering I suspect the answer](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m27s)



[may be something along the lines of we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m29s)



[didn't know about that use case but I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m32s)



[could be wrong yeah and there was](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m35s)



[something other than dotnet global tools](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m38s)



[that come up with as well so it looks](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m40s)



[like a tools manifest file or something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m42s)



[but it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m44s)



[not discoverable brilli at all it's it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m45s)



[it's managed by this whole separate area](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m49s)



[of the dotnet CLI and you have to like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m51s)



[just know to to to run it and it's you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m54s)



[know it's it's it's completely outside](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h42m58s)



[of msbuild land for example you know you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m00s)



[can't do things like version it with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m04s)



[with msbuild variables and things like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m06s)



[that so okay cool](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m09s)



[sorry about the tangent carry-forward](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m11s)



[no great okay quick question though so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m15s)



[now I have to ask yep that lame version](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m19s)



[latest was that something that the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m21s)



[template generated that's something in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m23s)



[our tumblr with latest rather than like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m28s)



[coding it to an actual version no we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m31s)



[discuss later just something I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m37s)



[noticing only because I avoid latest](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m39s)



[because it changes from machine to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m42s)



[machine right so but yeah carry forward](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m44s)



[I know where the coalesce repo is I know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m49s)



[how to log issues I also know how to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m52s)



[submit pull requests you know how to fix](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m55s)



[issues - that's good for requests you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h43m57s)



[love them yep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m00s)



[and actually this template is actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m02s)



[slightly behind we've made some updates](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m04s)



[since but they're they haven't been](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m09s)



[released yet so get on that sooner](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m10s)



[rather than later this is good enough](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m14s)



[for now so the first thing I'm gonna do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m16s)



[is go up here to my drop-down and change](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m20s)



[from IAS Express to to-do app dot web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m22s)



[because iose Express should not be used](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m25s)



[unless you absolutely need to emulate](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m28s)



[some very specific part of is it's it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m31s)



[it is it works horribly for example if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m35s)



[you press stop debugging it restarts](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m39s)



[your app it doesn't stop your app it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m43s)



[stops your app and then starts it again](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m47s)



[and so the next time you try to build or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m48s)



[run your app you can't build a run your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m51s)



[app because all the deals are locked by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m53s)



[is Express they introduced this several](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m55s)



[years ago and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m58s)



[not fix it so anyway so this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h44m58s)



[switching to this we'll just use it with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h45m02s)

[interesting maybe where to look but I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h49m44s)

[where the echoes coming from Who am I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h49m56s)



[is it gone now okay it's gone now yeah I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h49m59s)



[mean right now we're using vcli just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m08s)



[because it's it's kind of the standard](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m10s)



[official view tooling so it's maintained](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m14s)



[by the core view team so it's kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m16s)



[guaranteed to be essentially zero](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m18s)



[configuration out-of-the-box everything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m21s)

[totally know that that doesn't at all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m31s)



[mean that it's zero configuration works](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m33s)



[out of the box I'd like it definitely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m35s)



[doesn't but in this case that it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m37s)



[actually does work pretty well as we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m38s)



[see we just got a few up up and running](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h50m43s)

[with that application user model is that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m00s)



[the only or gets or any entities that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m03s)



[have in the the default template is just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m06s)



[that one user so ID okay that is yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m08s)



[that's correct we can go look at the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m12s)

[kind of the boilerplate new view CLI app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m39s)

[blurb down here about things that are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m51s)



[specific to colas so just some some very](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m53s)



[rudimentary next steps so you know go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h51m59s)



[create your data model add your entities](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m02s)

[framework migrations so the only reason](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m06s)



[that this page is working right now is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m09s)



[because I already have a database](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m11s)



[locally that happens to have the exact](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m13s)

[demo and the database is named the same](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m19s)



[because I've done this before in this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m21s)

[this out-of-the-box this this example](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m26s)



[page in fact wouldn't work and would](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m28s)



[throw an error saying you know internal](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m30s)

[tables that don't exist so now that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m38s)



[we've seen that we have an actual app up](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m42s)



[and running here running well I'm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m44s)



[echoing yeah yeah that's so weird it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m47s)



[must be my mic it wasn't that coming for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m52s)



[a while very strange we can go ahead and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h52m53s)



[stop the app here and we'll go ahead and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m01s)



[build out our entity framework data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m04s)



[model so what we want to do is go into](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m06s)



[our DB context we'll go ahead and leave](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m12s)



[the application users entity as it is we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m15s)



[won't we won't add anything to it we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m19s)



[won't remove anything from it it's it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m21s)



[dead simple it just has an ID in a name](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m23s)



[so since we're building a to-do app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m29s)



[we will add some entities let's say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m33s)



[we'll add a to do list go ahead and make](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m38s)



[that guy public we will add a primary](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m45s)



[key we will let the list have a name and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h53m55s)



[it will have a collection of items](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h54m08s)



[and just to be clear that this is just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h54m15s)

[a little bit more flavor to this so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h56m32s)



[we'll say that this name is required and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h56m33s)

[not getting into that crazy c-sharp no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h56m50s)



[lability stuff that yeah that's way](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h56m52s)



[beyond my paygrade you're underpaid that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h56m55s)



[point on that though is that we haven't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m02s)



[I don't think anybody yet has tried to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m04s)



[use colas with null ability turned on I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m07s)



[honestly have no idea what will happen](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m09s)



[it I suspect that the code generation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m13s)



[will immediately be completely broken](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m17s)



[because it will not it will either not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m19s)



[work or it will generate totally invalid](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m21s)



[code because it has no understanding of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m24s)



[null ability and what things are not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m26s)



[yeah no ability across interfaces that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m28s)



[can be easily no like web yeah there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m31s)



[there's some it adds a lot of overhead](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m36s)



[and yeah I'm not sold on it yet I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m38s)



[totally get the advantages but some of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m41s)



[the amount of code whenever it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m45s)



[obfuscates your code to add it I have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m46s)



[the other thing too you turn gullibility](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m48s)



[on and it EF will do different things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m50s)



[right so EF uses the know the presence](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m54s)



[of the readability flag to determine the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m57s)



[know ability of columns in your database](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h57m59s)



[so you turn it on and your EF migrations](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m01s)



[are going to change just for reasons](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m03s)



[right it's probably some ways you try](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m10s)



[them I like doing it and like I keep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m12s)



[slowly converting libraries to it and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m17s)



[we'll probably livestream it again I I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m19s)



[did some live streaming on turning no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m21s)



[ability on for the system command-line](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m22s)



[project and that was we'll say an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m24s)



[adventure so here the only thing that is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m27s)



[different is that little coal s](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m34s)



[attribute up at the top Andrew you want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m36s)



[to talk about that yeah so what the coal](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m37s)



[s attribute does](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m40s)



[it's literally just an attribute called](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m41s)



[coalesce attribute so you can just you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m43s)



[know have it like that and it looks nice](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m46s)



[and neat is that is kind of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m47s)



[attribute that we use in all the places](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m50s)



[where we want to say hey when we do our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m51s)



[cogeneration or when we're running](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m55s)



[actually at run time this is the thing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m56s)



[that we want to expose with coalesce so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h58m59s)



[by default coalesce will not pick up](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m02s)



[anything out of your data model and in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m04s)



[fact we can try this so let's go ahead](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m07s)



[and run the coalesce cogeneration here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m08s)



[so we're gonna be inside our web project](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m10s)



[and we're just gonna say dotnet coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m12s)



[and what this is gonna do is go examine](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m16s)



[our data and web project which it knew](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m20s)



[to pick up based on the values in this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m22s)



[coalesced JSON file that's in our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m24s)



[solution that comes out of the box with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m26s)



[the template pre-configured to point at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m30s)



[the right projects but if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m32s)



[move your projects changer on your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m34s)



[folder structure something like that you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m35s)



[get a save your files first no I did](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m39s)



[this on purpose](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m43s)



[oh no yes and just to be clear this has](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m44s)



[to be run from inside of the web project](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m52s)



[not the data project right so run your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m54s)



[migrations from the data project and run](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=00h59m58s)



[the coalesce generation from the web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m00s)



[project so this your migrations will end](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m02s)



[up in your data project and your web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m04s)



[stuff will end up in your web projects](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m05s)



[so it kind of makes sense for you to run](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m06s)



[that yeah int and technically you don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m08s)



[have to do this from your web project](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m11s)



[the only reason why why you do is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m12s)



[because we put the dotnet CLI tool](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m15s)



[reference in the CS proj of the web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m17s)



[project so this is what lets us lets](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m20s)



[dotnet recognize dotnet coalesce as a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m24s)



[valid command is this dotnet CLI tool](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m27s)



[reference in there this could very well](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m33s)



[be in the data project instead or it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m34s)



[could be in both projects actually if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m37s)



[there's nothing preventing you from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m39s)



[doing that and then you could actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m40s)



[run that in all your projects let's talk](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m41s)



[briefly about coerce JSON yeah so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m44s)



[coalesce JSON here it's in your solution](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m48s)



[items by default and in fact on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m51s)



[newer versions of the template we also](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m53s)



[include the directory build props file](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m56s)



[which is also another one that's super](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h00m59s)



[useful to have in there to have access](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m01s)



[to as a solution level file but the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m02s)



[coalesce JSON file just points has](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m05s)



[sections for your web project in your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m09s)



[data project so the web project is the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m11s)



[project where the generated output is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m13s)



[going to be put into the data project is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m16s)



[the project that coalesce is going to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m19s)



[look at to determine what to generate so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m21s)



[because there's kind of a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m25s)



[chicken-and-egg problem we can't we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m26s)



[can't for example generate based off of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m28s)



[the contents of the web project because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m30s)



[your web project may be in an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m33s)



[uncompensated code doesn't match what's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m34s)



[in your data project anymore](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m40s)



[so there kinda has to be this clear](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m42s)



[separation of generated output goes in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m44s)



[the web project input for the generation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m47s)



[comes out of the data project and and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m49s)



[never shall those lines be crossed got](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m51s)



[it and so the generated stuff if I can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m54s)



[go back and remember the graphic from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m56s)



[the beginning is gonna be all of my](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h01m58s)



[controllers all of my typescript and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m00s)



[generated views right so yes right so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m04s)



[all of those gray boxes there is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m08s)



[everything that ends up getting up](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m11s)



[dumped into my web project for me yep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m13s)



[just one quick comment to from Cameron](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m17s)



[apparently one of the projects he was on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m20s)



[they turned on null ability he said they](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m22s)



[didn't go through all of the cases but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m25s)



[it and I will put this in quotes seemed](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m27s)



[feasible so I heard that as a volunteer](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m30s)



[to do missed a bus to turn on null](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m35s)



[ability yeah thanks that's really great](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m37s)



[it yeah you're right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m40s)



[it's really just kind of a spirit of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m42s)



[people that we like to have it in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m44s)



[teletext is people like Cameron who just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m45s)



[put themselves out there and say hey](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m48s)



[I'll go do that horrible thing that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m49s)



[nobody wants to do Thank You Cameron](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m51s)



[yeah so the other thing in here that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h02m59s)



[have is we're saying root generator](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m01s)



[whose view so the two options here knock](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m02s)



[out in view knock out is actually the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m04s)



[default just for backwards compatibility](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m06s)



[sake but in this case because we use the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m08s)



[view template we're just saying hey you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m12s)



[know go generate view stuff don't go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m13s)



[generate knockout stuff because this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m15s)



[isn't a knockout project and then here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m17s)



[this is configured I should probably](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m20s)



[make this the default at this point but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m22s)



[this is just saying I want the script](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m24s)



[section all of the scripts generators](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m27s)



[which are all my front-end scripts I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m31s)



[want to change those through a different](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m32s)



[folder this whole file is documented on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m34s)



[on the documentation out here as well](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m40s)



[so my sidebars and collapsed so down](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m42s)



[here at the very very very bottom and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m46s)



[this cogeneration configuration page is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m50s)



[the documentation with the coalesced](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m54s)



[JSON file so we have our to-do lists and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h03m56s)



[our to-do items and we ran the Cochin](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m07s)



[but we had commented out the coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m08s)



[attribute and so we'll find coalesce is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m10s)



[actually going to complain about us](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m12s)



[because it didn't find anything that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m13s)



[wanted to expose the way we do that is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m16s)



[to keep this attribute there to not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m20s)



[comment it out but that just kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m22s)



[generates so DB context or something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m25s)



[that colas can expose um you can expose](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m29s)



[regular old classes as services if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m31s)



[also include the service attribute so if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m35s)



[we said colas and service so this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m37s)



[also an attribute in the colas namespace](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m41s)



[that said this is a service class that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m43s)



[we want to expose via a web api so just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m45s)



[to be clear that that service attribute](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m51s)



[base achill ESET sit up to say here's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m53s)



[another source of things that I want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m55s)



[generate controllers and whatnot for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h04m57s)



[right is that a fair way of phrasing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m00s)



[yeah and so the reason why you might](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m02s)



[make a service is because you have some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m04s)



[set of functionality that you want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m06s)



[have on your front end that doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m08s)



[really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m10s)



[pertain to a specific entity framework](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m10s)



[entity or it's not it doesn't really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m13s)



[belong as methods on entity because what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m16s)



[we can also do is you know we can add a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m18s)



[method saying you know public photos it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m22s)



[to the Nuge if we turn anything art](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m26s)



[complete I can say is done it's true you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m29s)



[can actually be just that simple and all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m35s)



[we have to do to expose this with colas](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m37s)



[it's just once again annotate it with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m39s)



[the colas attribute and that will then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m41s)



[generate out things on the front end](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m47s)



[it'll generate out an API endpoint make](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m49s)



[that really easy to call once we get to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m51s)



[kind of writing the front we'll see how](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m54s)



[that was part of the doing that and that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m55s)



[was part of the comment earlier about](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m57s)



[the the typescript stuff that it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h05m59s)



[generates are a little bit smarter than](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m01s)



[just like straight-up swagger type](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m02s)



[client Jen right is you get all of this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m04s)



[magical stuff built into it yep yeah and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m06s)



[so it knows when you call this endpoint](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m12s)



[you're actually calling this on an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m13s)



[instance of your to-do item class on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m15s)



[front end and it knows oh okay this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m17s)



[an instance method on my to-do item so I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m21s)



[need to send along my foreign key or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m23s)



[sorry my primary key and then the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m25s)



[controller knows okay I need to go pull](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m27s)



[that object out of the database using](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m29s)



[this primary key that I received and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m31s)



[then go call that method on that object](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m33s)



[so it so it's very intimately aware that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m37s)



[it's operating in a relational data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m40s)



[model um and and it knows you know kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m42s)



[of what you need to do to do back and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m46s)



[forth between the client and the server](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m48s)



[in that context yeah and there are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m49s)



[things like dependency injection and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m51s)



[things like that and we can get into](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m53s)



[that a little bit like let's say you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m54s)



[wanted to write a static method that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m55s)



[would iterate over everything in your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m57s)



[database or all that type of object and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h06m58s)



[do something maybe a little larger in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m00s)



[scale so right where we actually see so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m02s)



[even ignoring the fact that I didn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m07s)



[have the attribute and now I do we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m10s)



[actually have a different error which I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m12s)



[wasn't planning on having happen but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m14s)



[it's a great learning experience that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m16s)



[when we try to rerun the generation we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m20s)



[see to do updated models](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m21s)



[item list so the property list on to do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m24s)



[class to do item has no IDE property](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m27s)



[found for the related object and so the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m31s)



[way we fix that and it even suggest us](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m35s)



[to fix here so the related object needs](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m37s)



[to specify the foreign key that either](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m40s)



[matches by name or is marked with the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m42s)



[foreign key attribute so this is Co less](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m44s)



[air checking right this isn't some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m46s)



[magical shelling out somewhere else](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m48s)



[yes this is more or less so it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m49s)



[somewhat helping me not so : yeah yep so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m52s)



[colas can kind of only discover things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h07m58s)



[about your data model either via](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m01s)



[annotations or just via conventions so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m02s)



[just naming things in the right way and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m05s)



[also just by the presence of your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m08s)



[properties here what it can't do at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m10s)



[least not at the moment I've kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m13s)



[toyed around with this idea but didn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m14s)



[take it very far what it can't do is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m16s)



[determine anything that you may have set](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m19s)



[up in terms of relationships in your own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m21s)



[model creating method fortunately](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m23s)



[there's not really anything that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m27s)



[coalesced does that you can't configure](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m28s)



[with annotations and there's not really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m31s)



[anything that we found that we need to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m35s)



[do that you can't configure with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m37s)



[annotations but just know that you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m38s)



[if you do stuff and you configure a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m40s)



[relationship and you exclusively](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m42s)



[configure it in your own model creating](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m44s)



[an entity framework the coalesced can't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m46s)



[know what you put in there it doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m48s)



[run this method to determine what kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m50s)



[of fluent configuration you set up in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m52s)



[here and so if we you know related this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h08m54s)



[this ID to this list and you'll see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m01s)



[right here white coalesced couldn't pick](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m04s)



[this up is because I called its foreign](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m06s)



[key to do list ID but I called its](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m09s)



[navigation property just list so there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m11s)



[there's not there's not a complete](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m14s)



[Association there this should have been](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m17s)



[to do list and to do list ID and then it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m19s)



[knows just by convention you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m21s)



[navigation property and then the foreign](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m23s)



[key is the navigation property plus ID](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m25s)



[so colas can now pick that up just fine](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m29s)



[the other thing I could have done if I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m33s)



[for some reason wanted to keep that is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m35s)



[just say foreign key name of to-do list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m38s)



[ID import that from system component](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m44s)



[model and that's it so that's understood](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m49s)



[that's a annotation that's understood](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m52s)



[both by entity framework and by colas so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m53s)



[that not only configures your entity](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m57s)



[framework model to make sure everything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h09m59s)



[is matched up right but it also](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m00s)



[configures coalesce for now though I'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m03s)



[do it like that without the annotation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m12s)



[so Andrew you did mention kind of what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m14s)



[happens behind the scenes a little bit](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m17s)



[when you run that coalesced we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m18s)



[actually going in Andy's thing the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m20s)



[Rosalind compiler to compile the data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m22s)



[and then or just come out of the code](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m23s)



[and then actually go through all the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m26s)



[symbols it's not necessarily done at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m28s)



[runtime using reflection there's a part](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m31s)



[of this it does work on reflection but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m33s)



[all the codes in works off of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m35s)



[compiler and the symbols of the compiler](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m38s)



[crave which that's a whole nother talk](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m40s)



[we can do trying to get that thing to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m44s)



[work oh yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m46s)



[so now we'll see everything it just made](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m51s)



[for us so we'll see on these four will](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m53s)



[see regenerated because we came with the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m55s)



[template out of the box kind of the core](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h10m58s)



[files so these correspond one-to-one](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m00s)



[with the the four layers of the view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m02s)



[stack that I talked about earlier no in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m06s)



[no particular order because at all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m09s)



[they'll generate in parallel so just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m10s)



[come on whatever random order but we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m12s)



[have the API clients so those are our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m14s)



[static sorry not static but stateless](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m16s)



[clients which represent our API methods](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m19s)



[and we can actually go and look at these](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m22s)



[as we talk through them just to get a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m24s)



[better idea of what oh no I just opened](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m26s)



[to edge oh it's ok it's now chromium](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m28s)



[based it's not quite as yucky inside all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m31s)



[right so see we have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m41s)



[start a metadata first just go to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m43s)



[maximize that this font looks gonna](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m48s)



[wonky when it's zoomed in so we'll see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m51s)



[we have whole bunch it imports up here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m57s)



[and you can just kind of ignore that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h11m59s)



[that's just all of the types that kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m01s)



[of make this metadata work under the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m03s)



[hood so you'll see we're exporting a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m04s)



[Const here which is just an object this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m08s)



[in this object in particular represents](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m10s)



[our application user class it just kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m12s)



[of has all sorts of things on it you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m14s)



[know this is just the name so this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m16s)



[the actual name of the class this is a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m17s)



[human readable version of the name of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m19s)



[the class this tells us hey if I want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m21s)



[display an application user and you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m25s)



[didn't otherwise tell me how to display](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m27s)



[one this is what property you should](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m29s)



[render so you should render the name and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m31s)



[that's gets picked up by convention so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m34s)



[by default if you have a property called](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m36s)



[name coalesce we'll use that if you just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m38s)



[try to render an object raw without](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m40s)



[trying to actually to pick up specific](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m42s)



[property you wanna display some other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m45s)



[stuff here you know hey here's the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m50s)



[primary key this is a flag genome that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m51s)



[you can't tow it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m54s)



[flags are but this tells us whether you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m54s)



[can create or edit or delete the thing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m56s)



[this is all the different properties you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h12m59s)



[can say hey you know hey the application](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m01s)



[user ID this one is the primary key or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m03s)



[is the name is just a regular old value](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m05s)



[it doesn't kinda have any relational](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m08s)



[meaning and then that just kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m09s)



[continues on down here for all the other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m11s)



[types you know you'll see for example](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m13s)



[here's a foreign key so it has all sorts](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m16s)



[of fun stuff on it you know here's the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m18s)



[principal key that this foreign key](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m20s)



[points to so it points to on the type](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m23s)



[to-do list it points up to-do list ID](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m25s)



[the principal type is to-do lists so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m28s)



[to-do list ID references a to-do list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m32s)



[to-do list ID is a foreign key and it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m35s)



[also happens to have a navigation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m37s)



[property called to-do list in this case](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m39s)



[that's such a new list on the to-do item](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m41s)



[which corresponds to this property right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m43s)



[here and so on and so forth so again you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m47s)



[know this is a navigation property is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m50s)



[what kind of same things kind of just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m52s)



[keep going with that but it you know in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m54s)



[general you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m56s)



[never have to look at the metadata file](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m57s)



[or even really think about it it's just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h13m59s)



[kind of there you can always access this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m00s)



[information you're free to import this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m03s)



[in your own code if you want to do some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m05s)



[kind of crazy dynamic thing on your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m06s)



[front-end at runtime](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m08s)



[it's totally there for you but for the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m09s)



[most part this just kind of drives all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m13s)



[the rest of it and you basically you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m15s)



[changed it through attributes you put on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m18s)



[your models so there's a big list of all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m20s)



[the attributes that you can do in me in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m22s)



[the documentation you can go through and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m25s)



[look at all those so if you want to say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m27s)



[hey this is this is the property to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m28s)



[display or make another property you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m30s)



[could use a property that was just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m33s)



[dynamically calculated for your display](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m36s)



[name like let's say you wanted to have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m38s)



[the name and maybe the birth date you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m39s)



[could put that together really easily](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m41s)



[and just be clear this when we say it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m42s)



[affects it this is all the way down to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m45s)



[the view generation of like what what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m47s)



[type of field is it good and to generate](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m49s)



[for me one when it exposes this property](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m51s)



[on the front end you know you have some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m54s)



[control over that for sure I could show](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h14m58s)



[you a days do you want to see the date](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m04s)



[or a data at a time those kinds of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m05s)



[things just as the default again you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m07s)



[override this stuff and build all your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m11s)



[own but we wanted to make it kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m13s)



[give you that 90% solution out of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m15s)



[box and then the last 10% wow it doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m18s)



[isn't super easy it's pretty easy to go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m21s)



[ahead and do then just write your own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m25s)



[thing yep so next thing up is the models](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m26s)



[there so as I mentioned earlier these](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m34s)



[are just basically just a set of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m36s)



[interfaces that describe your model they](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m37s)



[also have a property on them called](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m41s)



[dollar sign metadata so that comes from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m43s)



[this base class model here so this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m45s)



[points at the corresponding metadata](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m48s)



[object for that type so an application](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m50s)



[user model is going to have a dollar](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m54s)



[sign metadata property that points at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m58s)



[the metadata for application user and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h15m59s)



[then it's just going to have all the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m02s)



[properties that were on your entity that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m03s)



[you've decided to expose the client by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m05s)



[default all of your public properties on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m08s)



[your entity](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m10s)



[are exposed to the client if you want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m11s)



[hide a property from colas and make](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m13s)



[colas never think about it or consider](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m16s)



[it or change it in any way you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m18s)



[either just market anything less than](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m21s)



[public or you can use this internal use](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m24s)



[attribute which comes from colas this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m30s)



[just a way instead of using the actual C](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m37s)



[sharp internal modifier this lets you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m39s)



[keep it public if you actually need it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m41s)



[to be public for purposes of react of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m43s)



[your back end but still hide it entirely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m45s)



[from colas it hide in this case really](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m49s)



[just means you've no word from any sort](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m52s)



[of generation ignored from generation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m55s)



[never sent to the client in any way](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h16m59s)



[never updated by any of the endpoints](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m02s)



[that colas exposes basically says cake](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m05s)



[colas pretend this doesn't exist yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m11s)



[with the one exception if you write a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m14s)



[method that changes that property it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m15s)



[will change it just takes it out of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m18s)



[the kind of object models that we hand](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m21s)



[back right and in that case it is still](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m23s)



[hidden from colas cuz colas I mean colas](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m27s)



[know what you're doing that point that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m29s)



[just your own code okay thank you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m34s)



[Oh window](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m41s)



[these also export a class which isn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m44s)



[ever actually really used as a class](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m48s)



[they just have just used to export some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m49s)



[static methods say hey given something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m52s)



[that might vaguely resemble an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m55s)



[application user convert this into an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h17m57s)



[actual application user model so it just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m00s)



[makes sure that all these properties are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m03s)



[initialized for example next layer up is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m05s)



[the API client so again these are the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m11s)



[stateless methods for calling the API](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m13s)



[endpoints so all these do you could you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m16s)



[know you could treat these classes like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m20s)



[Singleton's if you want they don't have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m22s)



[any state of their own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m24s)



[the Constructors parameterless at having](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m25s)



[them as classes is a really boon for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m31s)



[unit testing because then you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m34s)



[instantiate a specific API client and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m36s)



[past that you know for example inject](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m38s)



[that into a view model and then mock out](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m41s)



[some of your methods on the API client](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m44s)



[so that in your unit tests you're not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m46s)



[actually trying to call the server you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m47s)



[just mock out this particular API](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m49s)



[endpoint so here we see the one special](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m52s)



[API method that we made called mark](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m56s)



[complete that just does a little bit of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h18m58s)



[boilerplate here to map the incoming](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m01s)



[parameters in this case all it takes is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m04s)



[an ID but ID is the primary key of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m06s)



[to-do item that we're operating on and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m09s)



[then calls the method pack on the so how](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m14s)



[did it know to taking ideas just because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m16s)



[it's on a database entity so it just it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m18s)



[knows in order to get that entity it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m21s)



[needs the PK primary key for it exactly](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m23s)



[so it's in the instance method on an EF](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m27s)



[entity if it were so that it knows that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m30s)



[in order to figure out what instance to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m32s)



[call it on we gotta tell it a key and if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m35s)



[it were a static method yep so we go we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m37s)



[can do static it could also be on a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m43s)



[service class if we wanted to do that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m46s)



[that's in either case there yeah static](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m50s)



[you almost always need to dependency](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m54s)



[inject like your database context or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m56s)



[something like that because otherwise](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h19m58s)



[you can't do anything so do those yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m00s)



[so the things that we can dependency](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m06s)



[inject we kind of get a couple for free](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m08s)



[if you just put the type of your DB](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m10s)



[context so app TV context and in fact it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m13s)



[doesn't have to be a DB context that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m18s)



[owns this type it can actually be any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m20s)



[anything that derives from DB context](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m22s)



[and it will just inject it from your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m24s)



[service container it can be claims](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m26s)



[principal principal](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m29s)



[which will then inject the current user](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m34s)



[from the HTTP context in which the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m38s)



[method gets called and then you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m40s)



[inject anything else from your container](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m44s)



[if you just mark it with the inject](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m46s)



[attribute so we could you know add an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m50s)



[eye HTTP context access or so from the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m52s)



[container means the v-neck or default di](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m56s)



[container right okay yes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h20m59s)



[so we can get the curtain HCP contacts](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m14s)



[and say you know hey what's the IP](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m17s)



[address of the remote machine for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m20s)



[example and we could have made a static](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m30s)



[method in this case that hands that back](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m34s)



[I mean it doesn't make a lot of sense on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m35s)



[the to-do list item but if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m37s)



[mend that that's super easy to write I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m39s)



[mean just throw the static method on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m42s)



[there inject the piece you need and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m44s)



[return the data that you want right or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m46s)



[maybe you want the IP address for some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m48s)



[sort of audit logging or something you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m51s)



[know you want that cord what IP address](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m52s)



[they called from a mark that to the item](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m54s)



[donor you know whatever but but the idea](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m56s)



[here is that you can inject anything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h21m59s)



[from the service container that has been](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m01s)



[registered and start up including all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m03s)



[the things that you get from a subpoena](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m06s)



[core for free got it so anything from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m08s)



[the container marked with the inject](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m11s)



[attribute or dbcontext glass or claims](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m12s)



[principle yep right and you can you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m15s)



[find all of these so inside the methods](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m20s)



[page in the documentation we can see a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m22s)



[list of all the different types of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m28s)



[parameters of these accept so any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m30s)



[primitive like values so numbers strings](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m33s)



[Bulls enums date kind so that to date](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m35s)



[Nate update types and in c-sharp those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m39s)



[are all loud you can pass entire objects](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m46s)



[those can be entities or anything else](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m50s)



[just whatever you put there just be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m53s)



[aware that if you put some types that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m56s)



[you don't own like some CLR type or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h22m58s)



[something coalesce will generate DT owes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m02s)



[based off that CLR type and recursively](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m05s)



[for any properties that that CLR type](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m07s)



[owns that can explode badly if you pick](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m09s)



[the wrong type so so the recommendation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m15s)



[here is don't pick types that you didn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m17s)



[create yourself](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m20s)



[but it will give you a nice little](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m25s)



[client-side object that you can fill out](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m27s)



[and then hand back nope we can you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m30s)



[have file parameters so if you want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m36s)



[do a file upload it'll actually do this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m40s)



[as kind of a proper file upload and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m41s)



[we'll give you a browse for a file thing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m43s)



[you can pick the file and then when you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m45s)



[call them I said it'll actually upload](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m47s)



[the file and then again anything that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m49s)



[inherits from DB contacts you can inject](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m54s)



[the claims principal anything annotated](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m55s)



[with inject which will be injected from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h23m57s)



[your service provider and then an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m00s)



[include tree which I won't even try to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m02s)



[get into tonight which is a very](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m04s)



[interesting conversation around how do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m07s)



[you trim the objects that you're handing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m10s)



[back and how do you use EF and includes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m12s)



[and stuff like that so that's a whole](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m16s)



[other discussion for another day Kevin](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m18s)



[well I don't doubt it right how do you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m19s)



[serialize a circular object graph into a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m21s)



[serialization format that doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m25s)



[support reference preserving and doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m27s)



[otherwise really understand circular](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m31s)



[object references oh yeah JSON yeah and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m32s)



[how do you trim when EF gets overzealous](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m36s)



[and you brought back objects there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m38s)



[decides to start attaching to your your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m40s)



[your tree that you may not want a hand](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m43s)



[on a client because it's just extra](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m45s)



[craft granted there there are forms of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m47s)



[JSON that do support references but not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m51s)



[anything that is natively supported by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m55s)



[browsers for example so it requires to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h24m57s)



[pull in some additional library to kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m00s)



[of handle that which wasn't a step that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m02s)



[we were wanting to take okay and remove](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m05s)



[that HTTP context accessor but but yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m11s)



[now you have the DB and the user and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m14s)



[these can be async so we'll do a sync](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m16s)



[void like that async is really good](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m19s)



[just just try to make you squirm they're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m31s)



[like my twitch factor went way up no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m34s)



[return whatever you want or you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m43s)



[just regular tasks and don't return](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m47s)



[anything that's fine too](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m49s)



[we can also do tasks of item result what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m52s)



[item result is is a special type and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h25m58s)



[coalesce that lets us signal success or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m00s)



[failure and then also provide a specific](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m03s)



[failure message that will propagate up](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m07s)



[to the front end users so we can say if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m09s)



[is done item is already is already done](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m12s)



[so this has some implicit operators on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m26s)



[it that convert from string and if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m30s)



[give it a string it's an error message](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m32s)



[if you give it a boolean it's just a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m33s)



[straight success of success or failure](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m36s)



[generally you should probably not just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m39s)



[return false because that means you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m41s)



[just saying it didn't work but you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m43s)



[not giving any reason why it didn't work](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m44s)



[it is the most awesome and terrifying](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m47s)



[all at the same time I love it oh it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m50s)



[flagged async waiting when in when in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h26m59s)



[doubt wait for yeah so API clients that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m03s)



[have got generated this method here few](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m12s)



[models this is where all the magic](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m17s)



[happens it's not really worth looking at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m18s)



[what actually gets generated here yeah I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m23s)



[mean you can do that on your own time](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m25s)



[it's it's pretty similar other than that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m26s)



[you know pretty similar to the models](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m29s)



[the exception being is that we define](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m32s)



[all the properties for any anything that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m34s)



[was an object type we redefine that as](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m37s)



[the view model version of that object](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m39s)



[rather than the model](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m41s)



[and then you'll see here when we have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m43s)



[you know custom stuff special stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m46s)



[we'll also see things like this so this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m48s)



[is kind of our interface in our view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m52s)



[model for for interacting with this mark](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m55s)



[complete method need some water here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h27m57s)



[water is that the stuff that they put in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m04s)



[Mountain Dew to make it taste good I I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m07s)



[think that's what they did what they did](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m12s)



[say you can you can drink it rather than](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m14s)



[eat it with fork that sounds amazing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m16s)



[yeah it's so I think at this point let's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m22s)



[actually build a page here so we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m24s)



[actually start using some of this fun](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m29s)



[stuff we should run it and just show](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m30s)



[them the admin screen so you can see now](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m31s)



[that we've done all that work and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m33s)



[generated all those views oh yes we did](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m34s)



[we actually I need to regenerate because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m39s)



[we change the signature of this so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m42s)



[you'll see here you know in our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m43s)



[controller this is not going to work](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m45s)



[because we're missing those two](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m46s)



[parameters so we'll go ahead and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m48s)



[regenerate that the other thing that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m52s)



[need to do is remember my Windows](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m54s)



[terminal key whines oh they zoom](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h28m59s)



[independently oh that's interesting](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m02s)



[CG their CD into our data project and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m08s)



[add a migration because we just added](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m13s)



[two new tables that an ad framework](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m17s)



[doesn't yet know how to create those in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m20s)



[sequel server in this case that's sequel](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m22s)



[server local DB is what it's set up to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m25s)



[use by default since you get it for free](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m28s)



[with Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m30s)



[if you're writing c-sharp you probably](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m30s)



[have it it'll so do you always welcome](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m32s)



[to change that if you don't want to do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m36s)



[that to something like sequel Lite or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m37s)



[whatever your preferred and any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m40s)



[framework provider is migrations add to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m44s)



[do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m50s)



[we did just do a project for my sequel](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m55s)



[though worked out great no changes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h29m57s)



[straight so now we got our migration we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m00s)



[can go ahead and I'll just actually just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m03s)



[run this in here cuz why not run it on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m07s)



[the command line](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m14s)



[start it up okay now listening couldn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m18s)



[get that a refresh your first startup](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m23s)



[after after launching the process will](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m29s)



[be just a little bit slow as it couldn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m31s)



[does that an initial build of all your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m33s)



[JavaScript but then after that it only](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m34s)



[do it does incremental builds so it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m37s)



[only rebuilding the stuff that you've](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m40s)



[changed so we can go ahead and look at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m41s)



[one of the admin tables so we can say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m45s)



[slash admin and I'll tell you how we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m47s)



[know what this route is the inside of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m50s)



[our project inside router TS this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m53s)



[where we define the view router which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h30m58s)



[just defines all of the pages and the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m00s)



[URL slugs where those pages can be found](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m03s)



[you'll see we have a home page there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m07s)



[an about page there's this coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m09s)



[example page that we looked at earlier](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m11s)



[and then here is our coalesce admin](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m13s)



[routes so these components here that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m16s)



[these route two came from that coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m19s)



[beautify library that I was mentioning](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m22s)



[earlier so this is a component that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m24s)



[provides a complete admin page with all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m26s)



[of the features that you're about to see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m29s)



[but the path here slash admin and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m31s)



[slash the name of the type so in this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m34s)



[case we want to do list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m37s)



[it didn't work I suspect what happened](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m46s)



[here so that error message has lists](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m52s)



[plural yes that's actually it is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m54s)



[supposed to be so that comes off of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h31m59s)



[table name comes off the name of your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m02s)



[db7 so in this case it is to-do lists](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m04s)



[not the name of them the type of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m07s)



[name of the property on the TV contacts](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m09s)



[yep so in this case the migration](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m12s)



[appears to have not run and the only](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m16s)



[reason I can think that might have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m21s)



[happened is yeah because of this this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m23s)



[using a different database that it is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m28s)



[probably polluted with a bunch of other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m33s)



[migrations and entity framework got](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m34s)



[confused this that should be getting](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m36s)



[replaced in the template and it's not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m41s)



[I'll have to look at that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m43s)



[so oops so in our app settings that so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m45s)



[we have two places where this happens](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m48s)



[one is in our app settings of JSON so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m50s)



[this is kind of the main place that our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m52s)



[connection string comes from to do DB so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m53s)



[we'll just change this to some other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m57s)



[name doesn't matter what we picked it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h32m58s)



[should just match this one so this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m01s)



[development app DB context Factory is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m03s)



[the one that the EF command-line tooling](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m06s)



[will use when generating your migrations](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m08s)



[so it uses this to diff your database](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m10s)



[against your code and say okay what what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m13s)



[things do I need to put in this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m16s)



[migration what things are different](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m18s)



[versus the actual database and it can't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m20s)



[it it can I say it can't but it actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m25s)



[can use your startup does yes and it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m28s)



[will that you have command line tolling](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m31s)



[will actually run your is peanut course](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m32s)



[startups yes and look at like your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m34s)



[configuration here and it will execute](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m36s)



[this method and then pulls a database](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m38s)



[configuration back out of there but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m41s)



[there's cases where that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m43s)



[notably if you're running that you have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m46s)



[command-line tooling from your data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m48s)



[project instead of your web project this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m50s)



[is usually what you want to do they kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m52s)



[of did this for this kind of weird](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m56s)



[scenario that they they advertise for a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h33m58s)



[while and kind of like they're all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m01s)



[getting started with a is peanut core](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m02s)



[and an entity framework put your web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m03s)



[project in your date and your DB context](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m06s)



[and put everything in one project which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m08s)



[is great I guess it's a kind of you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m13s)



[basic intro but it but it doesn't scale](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m16s)



[well so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m19s)



[and also doesn't work at all with colas](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m20s)



[if they have to be in separate projects](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m22s)



[so anyway we'll change our database name](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m25s)



[save all the files go to and stop the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m27s)



[app start it back up when it starts back](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m31s)



[up but we'll try to rerun the migrations](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m35s)



[it'll find that the database doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m37s)



[exist so it'll create it automatically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m38s)



[and then we'll be good to go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m41s)



[so that so this right here is the reason](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m46s)



[why that colas example page is working](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m49s)



[for me earlier is because I already had](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m51s)



[some of their database on my machine](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m53s)



[that happened to have a table with the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m54s)



[same name is there any chance that your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m56s)



[DB migrations might be a little dork if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h34m57s)



[it was doing it against the wrong](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m00s)



[database yes actually yes I think they](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m01s)



[actually were no they weren't it may](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m08s)



[have been dipping it against the DB the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m12s)



[app may be context model snapshot which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m14s)



[is the other thing that it uses to give](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m18s)



[your database I don't entirely](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m20s)



[understand a which thing it uses in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m22s)



[which case but it does ok so now we have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m23s)



[a admin page for a to-do list so we got](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m30s)



[all kinds of things we have pagination](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m33s)



[and we have filtering we have searching](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m34s)



[we have creating we have lists that are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m37s)



[empty because we didn't create something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m40s)



[so we can make something work items and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m42s)



[you can see it was saving as we type so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m51s)



[you saw some activity over here in our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m55s)



[actual web application running here in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h35m58s)



[the process but you can also but as we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m00s)



[type it's actively saving what we type](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m10s)



[so all that and pages have autosave](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m12s)



[automatically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m14s)



[so we can go ahead and add some items](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m21s)



[and you'll see when we click this link](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m24s)



[here so we're on a specific to-do list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m28s)



[called work items when we click this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m31s)



[none link this actually brings us to a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m32s)



[to-do item list that is filtered to that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m35s)



[specific list so it's a pre-populated](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m38s)



[with this filter so we're filtering to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m41s)



[do items belonging to the work items](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m43s)



[to-do list and when we say create](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h36m45s)

[there's not a magical way to just create](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h37m27s)



[a user right here so I'll just open a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h37m29s)

[do on custom pages but it's not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h37m36s)

[what you type in still that's pretty](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h37m46s)



[cool so we'll go to the admin user the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h37m49s)

[out all the required fields it now saved](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m11s)



[and now it popped up this actions list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m14s)



[of the method that we had added to the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m16s)



[to-do item and we could say mark](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m22s)



[complete so we can expand this little](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m25s)



[guy here if you had multiplies multiple](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m27s)



[methods you would see those all here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m29s)



[you can say execute and it's son](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m31s)



[you see result is null that's actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m36s)



[been fixed it should just say success](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m39s)



[because they didn't have anything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m42s)



[specific to say about it that is cool](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m43s)



[if we hit this again we can there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m47s)



[because the item is already done and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m51s)



[that came of course from the code that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h38m58s)



[we wrote over here to say that the item](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m00s)



[is already done so kind of going back to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m04s)



[the beginning of the conversation it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m10s)



[being able to say and put the logic in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m12s)



[for what do I do if I run this too many](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m15s)



[times but doing all the plumbing to get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m17s)



[in between those two pieces is a lot of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m19s)



[work and so that's kind of all the stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m20s)



[that coalesced us for you and just lets](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m22s)



[you do the parts that you care about](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m24s)



[that's pretty slick now so these are all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m30s)



[generated pages so obviously I don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m34s)



[want to go in and necessarily muck with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m36s)



[the code in here because I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m38s)



[next time the generator runs it blows](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m40s)



[this stuff away right but I can yeah and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m42s)



[these aren't in the knockout stack these](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m46s)



[would be kind of generated and you had](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m48s)



[these you'd have these pretty big CS](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m50s)



[HTML files that have all these you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m52s)



[you'd see the input field for a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m54s)



[description and is done until you listen](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m56s)



[design to and so on in the view stack](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h39m58s)



[these are all kind of dynamically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m01s)



[created at runtime based off of the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m03s)



[metadata and so there's not actually a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m05s)



[file that was generated that gives us](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m09s)



[this page it's just a component which is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m11s)



[driven off of the metadata so it says](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m14s)



[you know okay I'm an admin page okay you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m16s)



[know for example an admin list I'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m21s)



[start there you an admin list is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m23s)



[comprised of this toolbar up here which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m26s)



[itself is comprised of you know this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m29s)



[pagination control and this filter](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m31s)



[drop-down and and this you know showing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m33s)



[one through one of one this textual](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m36s)



[representation of pagination](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m39s)



[and of course this list here but those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m41s)



[are all components that are exist in in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m45s)



[the beautify components for colas which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m48s)



[I do it lost here go down into the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m52s)



[documentation to the beautify components](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h40m59s)



[so the page that we're looking here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m01s)



[right now for this list is let me zoom](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m04s)



[that back in is the see admin table page](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m09s)



[and if we go and look at the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m15s)



[documentation for this we'll see you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m17s)



[know hey you know normally you use it by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m18s)



[passing it to a view router you just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m21s)



[route directly to it you don't typically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m23s)



[embed it within some custom page](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m25s)



[although you certainly could no that's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m28s)



[totally valid thing to do but it's it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m31s)



[it's designed of UI elements that allow](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m33s)



[it to serve the standalone page but this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m36s)



[particular component is built off of AC](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m39s)



[admin table and AC admin methods](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m42s)



[component so the C admin methods](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m46s)



[component is the one that we saw here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m49s)



[with these actions and then each method](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m53s)



[on thing so when that's a used on the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m56s)



[list that shows the static methods when](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h41m58s)



[that's used on an instance it shows the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m01s)



[instance methods these are very similar](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m03s)



[to what I would call like a WPF data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m04s)



[template and so you can take those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m07s)



[individual ones and say hey I only want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m09s)



[this top grid embedded inside of my page](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m11s)



[and drop that component in mmhmm yeah so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m14s)



[let's let's do that right now because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m19s)



[it's super easy so we will go and we'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m20s)



[just take this existing view that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m26s)



[have this coalesce example page this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m28s)



[just kind of has a bunch of stuff on it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m33s)



[honestly I don't really want to keep any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m35s)



[of this I'm just gonna blow away pretty](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m37s)



[much all of it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m41s)



[I'm just to kind of get things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m43s)



[simplified down here um I'll get rid of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m44s)



[that get rid of that I'll get rid of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m49s)



[that I'm so all that we're gonna keep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m51s)



[here is our class here so this defines](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h42m55s)



[all of the scripts for a component what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m00s)



[we're going to do is we're gonna add a C](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m01s)



[admin table](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m07s)



[let me reference the documentation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m11s)



[because I don't normally use the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m13s)



[standalone so Syedna table takes the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m16s)



[property called model which is expected](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m20s)



[to be a ListView model so we will say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m23s)



[model is a to-do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m26s)



[I don't list have cats walking on my](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m32s)



[keyboard and to-do item list will just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m37s)



[stick on our component down here as a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m43s)



[new to-do item and we'll see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m46s)



[intellisense jumps in action says you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m48s)



[know hey here's all your to-do item](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m52s)



[stuff that was generated for you so in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m53s)



[this case we want to do I don't list you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m55s)



[model go ahead and save that and that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h43m57s)



[it we're gonna go to colas example no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m03s)



[that didn't work and I'll tell you why I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m13s)



[didn't work the admin page component](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m15s)



[because it's designed to be standalone](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m19s)



[does things like automatically loads the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m21s)



[list for you I might be saying totally](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m23s)



[the wrong thing so hang on let me double](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m26s)



[check but that's not what happened whew](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m27s)



[model or did I document that wrong I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m31s)



[absolutely wrote the wrong name in the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m36s)



[documentation if the prop is not called](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m40s)



[model the prop is called list and it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m45s)



[that doesn't even match](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m48s)



[hey Cameron I still hear heard somebody](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m52s)



[else you still here one a log a bug for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h44m58s)



[me so this not called models caught list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m01s)



[great looks like he's all over that I am](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m05s)



[there we go so now we have just the list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m10s)



[part complete with its contents](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m15s)



[pagination and all that kind of stuff](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m19s)



[and we could kind of keep drilling into](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m23s)



[these so we you know see i'ma table](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m26s)



[itself is a CNN table toolbar and a C](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m28s)



[table and C list imaginations so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m32s)



[seedless pagination is the guy at the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m34s)



[top right Basin that's actually part of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m38s)



[the toolbar that might be wrong as well](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m42s)



[I thought there was pagination oh you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m46s)



[know what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m49s)



[no I said the template is a little bit](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m52s)



[out of date the template is a little bit](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m54s)



[out of date and I think that has been](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h45m59s)



[added so it's just pagination](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m02s)



[information at the very bottom but but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m04s)



[this is a great chance to say you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m06s)



[hey how do i upgrade this thing because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m07s)



[you know they said it's not just nougat](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m09s)



[packages it's NPM packages and all that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m11s)



[so I just went to the documentation page](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m13s)



[which I know happens to have a link to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m16s)



[coalesce view on NPM but you could just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m18s)



[book go to coalesce or sorry go to NPM](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m22s)



[and search for coalesce view just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m25s)



[because I don't know off the top of my](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m29s)



[head exactly what this version number is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m30s)



[which is the latest version no don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m33s)



[don't look at latest that's not actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m37s)



[just devastated](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m39s)



[latest in this case and NPM our old](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m41s)



[means like the latest release version](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m43s)



[typically um so we'll go over here and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m45s)



[find our package JSON file will find our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m49s)



[to coalesce packages so it's colas view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m55s)



[and Co us beautify oops here a white](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h46m57s)



[space](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m01s)



[and we will read both of those and we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m03s)



[want to keep those on the same version](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m06s)



[if they get out of sync they might you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m08s)



[know just have a little compatibility](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m11s)



[issues with each other so we can save](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m12s)



[that and then we will CD into our web](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m14s)



[project or if you have the visual city](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m18s)



[automatic and BM packet restore enable](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m20s)



[you can let that do its thing - nope](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m22s)



[that's not the right thing it's not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m27s)



[dotnet this is the NPM package we'll do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m30s)



[an NPM install or PMI for short actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m32s)



[I should have if you don't stop your app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m44s)



[before doing this sometimes it can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m47s)



[explode because you're trying to update](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m50s)



[files out from underneath the node](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m55s)



[process that's running your view up in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m57s)



[the background when you say it may](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h47m59s)



[explode do you mean your NPM install](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m01s)



[will explode or the app will explode at](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m03s)

[will slow the whole thing way down and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m17s)



[also probably just cause a one or the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m21s)

[it was trying to change or something](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m30s)



[like that so just a pro tip there stop](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m32s)

[in otherwise it gets unhappy I get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m39s)



[unhappy too we can reload and I think we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m46s)



[will now see pagination at the bottom of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m56s)



[this lists](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h48m58s)



[and once that first build finishes there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m03s)



[it is so this this is why the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m17s)



[documentation said there's lists](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m19s)



[pagination on the bottom because there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m21s)



[is so just additional controls if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m22s)



[had a very tall list you want to be able](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m27s)



[to hit next page after you scroll down](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m29s)



[to the bottom of the list not have to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m31s)



[scroll all the way to the top and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m32s)



[hit next page so don't we added that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m34s)



[cool and I assume that page subs and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m36s)



[everything is configurable in there too](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m39s)



[yeah so we could add you know because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m42s)



[this is just a custom page we could](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m46s)



[start adding you know we could either](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m47s)



[use you know something that second out](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m49s)



[of the box beautify thing like V](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m51s)

[component that constrains the width of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m56s)



[your page and add some borders and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h49m59s)



[margins to kind of make it look nice](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m00s)



[like this or you can just you know start](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m02s)



[adding just regular old CSS margins and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m07s)



[whatnot if you want to do that to it the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m09s)



[other notion of page size which I know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m15s)



[realize you meant um it's like this page](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m16s)



[size yes you can do that too so maybe](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m19s)



[unmounted we want to say to do i don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m23s)



[list dot oops this item list dot page](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m26s)



[size and so we'll see on our list view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m32s)



[model we have all of these different](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m35s)



[properties so all of the kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m36s)



[out-of-the-box coalesce ones that aren't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m39s)

[properties and your method names that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m44s)



[you've created on your data model or all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m47s)



[prefixed with dollar sign that just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m48s)



[avoids name conflicts also just kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m50s)



[offers the things like hey these are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m53s)



[kind of list standard ones that are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m55s)



[gonna be there on everything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m56s)



[you know we have you know a size equals](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h50m59s)



[25 and now wait see our page size is 25](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m03s)



[cool okay let me put that over here so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m09s)



[we didn't really see that hot module](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m13s)



[reloading in practice so if I say that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m16s)



[100 save the file and then oh nice](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m18s)



[you're making it look easy we can add](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m22s)



[the lists you know we could say some of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m29s)



[these are in here inside the program](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m37s)



[there's objects that we could say that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m40s)



[not a very good one filter to ones where](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m44s)



[is done is true](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m49s)



[I'll give us a filter by default which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m52s)



[now we see on the admin pages is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m54s)



[configured up here that's that's wrong](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h51m56s)



[that a artifact of hot module hitting no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m08s)



[maybe that's broken I mean it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m13s)



[it was filtering katroo but it's like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m17s)



[the the toggles there default it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m19s)



[defaults but if we turn that back to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m21s)



[falls back to actually Falls then we see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m22s)



[the one item that we had that was done](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m25s)



[is now gone as we said we are the ones](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m28s)



[buries darkness falls](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m30s)



[so fun chicken in the egg with filtering](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m35s)



[if I'm understand yeah yeah I don't know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m39s)



[why that's broken but I'm typing there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m44s)



[in the background somebody love you get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m48s)



[up issue maybe so I'm done on that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m50s)



[filter well I I assume that that control](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m53s)



[that it was showing there where it has](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m56s)



[the on/off and then the null that would](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h52m59s)



[be if the property was actually nullable](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m02s)



[or or his knoll just don't send it over](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m04s)



[the wire type deal in that case I know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m06s)



[that's so that's yep you're exactly](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m09s)



[right so that's filtering where the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m11s)



[actual property has a value of got it in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m12s)



[this case actually none of our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m16s)



[properties here art nullable because we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m18s)



[made them require well it is done I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m20s)



[believe we made it into a boolean that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m24s)



[requiring this yeah so none of these](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m29s)



[could actually be no assume it could be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m31s)



[no that would say give me the ones where](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m34s)



[the value was actually in all gadget](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m37s)



[cool and and we could add you know we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m39s)



[could add a filter for descriptions we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m42s)



[could say fix the star then I'll give us](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m44s)



[all the ones that start with fixed uh](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m49s)



[hey you show the searching a little bit](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m53s)



[to Andrew mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m56s)



[yeah so and actually the searching it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h53m57s)



[let me remove that the searching is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m00s)



[actually not going to work right now](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m03s)



[because we haven't configured any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m04s)



[properties to search so if I say fix I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m06s)



[now get no results so the way we want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m09s)



[set that up to work is over here in our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m13s)



[c-sharp data model we're gonna go ahead](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m17s)



[and just annotate this with search there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m20s)



[are some properties that can be searched](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m25s)



[by default if you have a again similar](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m26s)



[to the display text if you have property](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m30s)



[cult name that will be searchable by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m32s)



[default also the primary key will be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m34s)



[searchable by default so if we actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m37s)



[just say one it actually comes up with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m39s)



[that result because this happens to be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m41s)



[the item with primary key one](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m43s)



[that applies if you don't have any](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m48s)



[properties marked as searchable if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m50s)



[do have any properties marked as](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m52s)



[searchable then it will use the ones](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m53s)



[that you marked instead and won't use](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m55s)



[those defaults so if we want the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h54m57s)



[description to be searchable we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m01s)



[annotate it with search and we have a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m03s)



[couple different options here one of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m04s)



[these this first one here is split on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m07s)



[spaces so this will split your search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m09s)



[term into each word that you entered](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m11s)



[split by space character and then it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m15s)



[will search across all your searchable](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m20s)



[properties with the each word that was](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m22s)



[in your search term so if you have two](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m31s)



[strings you can find those words in two](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m33s)



[different strings if you put down two](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m35s)



[words with a space in between mm-hmm so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m37s)



[we can and we can actually do that so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m40s)



[we'll let you put the search property on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m41s)



[a navigation property and we'll see what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m43s)



[that does so we'll say is split on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m46s)



[spaces is true and then we can say in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m48s)



[this case I don't want to do the search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m54s)



[method but in this case we can say is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m55s)



[split on spaces true and we can say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h55m57s)



[search method is and we can either pick](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m02s)



[up begins with search or a contain](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m08s)



[search now just a note that you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m10s)



[when you're going against the database](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m13s)



[begins with search can use an index to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m15s)



[speed it up a contained search cannot](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m18s)



[use an index yes a which neither of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m20s)



[these do a full-text search we haven't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m28s)



[added that option but we could if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m31s)



[somebody wanted to do it it's just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m32s)



[usually and and I actually just did this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m35s)



[recently on one of our clients projects](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m38s)



[as I added a full text search and it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m40s)



[it's not just as simple as like adding](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m42s)



[an attribute on something if you want a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m44s)



[really good full text search that kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m47s)



[of gives you really high fidelity](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m50s)



[results you have to do a lot of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m52s)



[fine-tuning and writing of raw sequel](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m54s)



[queries to get that to work right there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m56s)



[there's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m58s)



[rising amount of work involved to make](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h56m59s)



[that a really nice experience I found so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m02s)



[but we'll do a contains on that and I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m07s)



[will use so when we say search on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m12s)



[application user will actually get the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m15s)



[name property by default although we'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m16s)



[just go ahead and be explicit here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m18s)



[anyway search using split on spaces and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m21s)



[then the default is it starts with and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m28s)



[we'll just leave that as the default](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m30s)



[here now using my intimate knowledge of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m31s)



[how colas works I know that the search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m36s)



[attribute does not require at Cochin](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m38s)



[because it doesn't affect the generated](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m40s)



[code in any way it's only if it gets](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m42s)



[picked up at runtime um so I don't need](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h57m44s)

[you work with on the front end so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m11s)



[obviously if you add a new property and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m12s)



[you want to use it on the front end you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m14s)

[out what fields to search rather than](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m28s)

[I'd say most times when you make changes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m47s)



[to your data model you just need to run](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m48s)



[the run the cochon yeah a search search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m52s)



[really is kind of one of those edge](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m55s)



[cases where you don't but most other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h58m57s)



[things you do so we can go ahead and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m00s)



[search here and we can say fix and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m03s)



[actually let's add some more things so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m06s)



[we can have more interesting search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m07s)



[results break](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m09s)



[code I guess everything's gonna be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m11s)



[signed to Cameron because we only have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m15s)



[one person how handy is that oh it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m17s)



[alright I'm filtered stone because I put](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m25s)



[that in the code so it's oh I never I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m29s)



[removed it but I never save the file](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m32s)



[so now owner type fix we just get that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m35s)



[one or if we say Cameron Cameron's we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m39s)



[don't get anything but Cameron we do we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m44s)



[say Cameron fix which is a nice complete](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m47s)



[sentence but I find myself saying often](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m52s)



[sorry sorry Cameron oh we're picking on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m55s)



[you all night usually and it's super](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=01h59m58s)



[handy when you're looking for objects](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m05s)



[because it will actually traverse down](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m06s)



[multiple layers of your object model to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m08s)



[find things and it just kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m11s)



[magically works by annotating stuff with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m14s)



[Co s that is that is pretty awesome](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m16s)



[though he's just thinking about the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m20s)



[amount of code that I would go through](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m21s)



[and implement that going all the way](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m25s)



[from my front end object all the way to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m28s)



[the back and querying the database and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m30s)



[pulling that back and and did I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m32s)



[understand correctly was that going as](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m36s)



[you were typing because there's some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m38s)



[sort of timer so that so that's yeah so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m40s)



[there is it does do it automatically as](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m44s)



[you type and it it it's it's debounce so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m46s)



[it doesn't I mean because it's all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m49s)



[running a localhost it completes in you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m51s)



[know single-digit milliseconds that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h00m53s)



[that's two digits but it's almost the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m04s)



[single digit but if we you know if we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m07s)



[introduce some latency into the thing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m13s)



[here then we delete that then we can see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m16s)



[you know hey there's a progress bar](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m18s)



[there well as searching and we can say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m20s)



[you know fix the template and other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m22s)



[other words that aren't matched that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m27s)



[means that it basically searches sort of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m34s)



[as fast as the network allows and as](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m37s)



[fast as the server allows](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m43s)



[cancer-specific fields in there and ER](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m45s)



[you can so I mean you know say if you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m48s)



[wanted to search you know is done for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m51s)



[false then that wouldn't work as I don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h01m56s)



[say we don't support boolean's and I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m00s)



[picked a terrible example of that but a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m01s)



[free search we added search bits to the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m04s)



[other two things let me reduce my](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m12s)



[network throttling there that one works](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m16s)



[so I specifically said even though to-do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m19s)



[list wasn't marked as searchable by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m22s)



[default as a kind of freeform text](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m24s)



[search I can still say hey specifically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m26s)



[on to-do list I want to search for work](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m29s)



[I don't know that it works on multiple](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m32s)



[it does like that or if I said you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m34s)



[work things now it doesn't match so how](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m39s)



[does so what property is that so that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m43s)



[it because I so it's property name :](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m46s)



[thing I want to search for right yep and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m49s)



[is that the the property name that was](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m52s)



[generated in typescript is it is that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m55s)



[case sensitive or how does that no it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h02m57s)



[not I just typed that pipe I typed it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m02s)



[like that by habit it it has to be you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m05s)



[know I mean whatever your property name](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m09s)



[in c-sharp was it can be any form of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m11s)



[that and in this case this to do space](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m13s)



[list is just splitting the Pascal case](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m17s)



[word on the words and the Pascal case](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m19s)



[words gotcha okay so it still records or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m24s)



[someone didn't do this would still](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m28s)



[require some knowledge of what the the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m29s)



[backing property is for the object yep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m31s)



[and a lot of times I mean it is it is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m39s)



[you know fairly obvious this is kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m42s)



[a feature that isn't it wouldn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m45s)



[generally be used by general users if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m47s)



[you you know we're to expose the search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m49s)



[on a custom page you wrote most users](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m51s)



[would never even think to try this that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m54s)



[ones that do might not get very far they](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m57s)



[don't know where your properties are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h03m59s)



[called](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m00s)



[it's kind of a power user secret hidden](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m02s)



[feature more than anything but but some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m05s)



[people do stumble across it and it is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m09s)



[nice to just have that work anyway audit](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m13s)



[is there a way to turn that off if for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m15s)



[example I have like colons in my data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m17s)



[that I want people to actually be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m20s)



[searching for what a great question not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m22s)



[not is like a super simple like boolean](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m32s)



[flag or attribute or something but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m34s)



[that's a great segue into data sources](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m36s)



[so what we can do you know coalesce kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m40s)



[of does all this stuff and exposes our](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m43s)



[data and sends us a client and the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m44s)



[client could search and sort and filter](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m47s)



[it and kind of anyway they want in order](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m48s)



[to have some control over that we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m52s)



[add a class to our our entity here and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h04m54s)



[it can either be a nested class or it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m02s)



[can live outside if you don't make it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m04s)



[nested you have to add an additional](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m07s)



[attribute that says hey this is a data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m08s)



[source for it to do item but if you just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m10s)



[nest it then you don't have to do that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m12s)



[gymnastics so we're gonna implement](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m16s)



[inherit from a standard data source](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m20s)



[which is kind of the place where pretty](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m22s)



[much all of the magic in terms of all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m24s)



[the sorting searching filtering the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m26s)



[other word is another word there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m29s)



[the coalesced does this is the class](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m31s)



[that does it yes sorting thanks](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m34s)



[this is the class that does it all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m37s)



[so if we do this in our DB context is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m41s)



[app DB context so we define this class](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m44s)



[make me a constructor then we got all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m50s)



[these methods that we can override here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h05m54s)



[that are kind of the individual pieces](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m00s)



[that build up the query that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m02s)



[ultimately send off to entity framework](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m04s)



[which it then turns the sequel and and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m05s)



[gives us results so for example to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m08s)



[override the searching we might override](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m12s)



[the apply list search term method and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m16s)



[say instead of your default behavior of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m20s)



[doing kind of all that stuff and using](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m25s)



[the search attributes and all that kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m27s)



[of stuff what do I want or use the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m29s)



[built-in decompiler in Visual Studio if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m40s)



[you're exceptionally lazy it's it's not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m43s)



[the great pretty code the variables are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m47s)



[all weird but it's close enough the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m50s)



[searching is actually one of the most](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m53s)



[complex parts of what the data sources](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m54s)



[do but if you do want to just kind of do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m57s)



[your own custom searching I'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h06m59s)



[override what colas does by default and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m01s)



[kind of you know just ignore all the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m04s)



[attributes just I want to do my own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m05s)



[thing here maybe I want to use a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m07s)



[full-text search and use the note e F](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m09s)



[dot functions using statement dot](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m13s)



[contains or dot free text so the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m21s)



[functions any effort let you interact](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m27s)



[with sequel servers full-text search if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m28s)



[you wanted to use those instead for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m32s)



[example then you could say you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m34s)



[returned query dot where](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m36s)



[item item dot that's probably like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m40s)



[item de description parameters don't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m45s)



[search so as an example if you had set](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m51s)



[up full-text indexes on this type you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h07m58s)



[could now though go and then you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m02s)



[say hey this is how I want to search on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m04s)



[this thing so what is that parameters](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m06s)



[dot search that's what the user typed](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m08s)



[into the search bar yep so this filter](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m09s)



[is pram filter parameters here is kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m13s)



[of all of the the the search field here](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m15s)



[it's it's these it it will contain the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m20s)



[pagination information so so this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m26s)



[particular one there's kind of three](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m28s)



[layers of these so the filter parameter](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m32s)



[is a data source parameter with search](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m34s)



[and filter this in particular just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m37s)



[includes these two guys so this this one](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m40s)



[lets you pick if you have multiple data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m42s)



[sources you can pick which one you want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m44s)



[to use this is kind of its whole own](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m45s)

[on the cola stocks called the include](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h08m52s)

[way of kind of doing some some filtering](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m23s)

[and parent tables and so you have this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m46s)



[massive piece of data that's going back](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m48s)



[and so you if you use it in one case you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m49s)



[may want the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m52s)



[30 and in another case you may want](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m53s)



[these 10 and so that way you have a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m55s)



[really easy way to do that you can just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m57s)



[code that up and you can either use a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h09m59s)



[data source or the includes true there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m00s)



[a number different ways to make it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m01s)



[happen but it's pretty nice to be able](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m02s)



[to do that in and you can do based on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m04s)



[security contacts and a couple of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m07s)



[different things on that and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m08s)



[there's another class of these](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m12s)



[parameters objects called list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m13s)



[parameters and those are specifically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m16s)



[when you're operating in an actual list](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m19s)



[which has a notion of pagination and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m22s)



[which has a notion of ordering like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m24s)



[this is the place yep](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m27s)



[so this is a place word what page number](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m30s)



[you're asking for word what how big what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m32s)



[fields do you want to sort by obey up](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m35s)



[and by the way these you can click on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m36s)



[that ORS here to sort them we kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m38s)



[skipped over that but and in once again](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m43s)



[I mean just like all the rest of us you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m48s)



[know that sorting is just being applied](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m51s)



[by a method here in this case there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h10m54s)



[one called apply list sorting which then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m00s)



[in turn either calls apply list default](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m02s)



[sorting or a playlist client specified](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m04s)



[sorting depending on whether the client](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m06s)



[did specify an ordering or not so you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m08s)



[can specify a default sort order once](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m12s)



[again with an attribute so we can say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m16s)



[don't know why that is the very in it in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m23s)



[the tooltips that's a very last property](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m26s)



[despite being most useful one so we can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m28s)



[say hey by default sort this one by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m32s)



[descending or actually more usefully you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m34s)



[know sort is done by in this case a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m37s)



[sending because we want not done items](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m43s)



[first we want the done items to kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m48s)



[fall off to the bottom of a list it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m50s)



[it's the way to remember that is false](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m54s)



[is zero so in ascending order zero comes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h11m58s)



[before one so we want false first or we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m00s)



[could have overridden not here with one](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m10s)



[of these methods on the data source now](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m12s)



[this data source will only be picked up](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m15s)



[if you explicitly asked for it so to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m18s)



[fight this despite the name that I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m20s)



[called this default source this is not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m21s)



[being picked up by default it will only](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m23s)



[be picked up by colas if you explicitly](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m26s)



[configure call us to use it in the way](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m28s)



[you would do that on your front end is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m32s)



[you come in here and say this to-do item](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m34s)



[list dot data params duh](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m38s)



[I thought I had yes I didn't I had a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m42s)



[shortcut property for that parameter](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m46s)



[source equals new and in this case the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m48s)



[data sources are actually in the model](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m54s)



[layer so we need to do item from the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m56s)



[models](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h12m59s)



[we need to do item data sources which](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m02s)



[doesn't exist because I haven't run the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m08s)



[cogeneration yet so we could stop that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m10s)



[just really quickly run that our C sharp](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m19s)



[has errors we have a stray bracket on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m34s)



[line 64 for an open paren close paren](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m38s)



[it's the file not saved I don't do it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m48s)



[all those things like little Asterix](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m54s)



[needs to be a big red circle yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h13m57s)



[if only I could detect what files are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m01s)



[saved or not saved in Visual Studio from](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m04s)



[this command-line application so that's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m06s)



[now there so now we come back here and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m13s)



[we see we can say sources dot default](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m16s)



[source so that's just a class that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m19s)



[can instantiate and then associate like](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m22s)



[that so that's one way to pick the data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m24s)



[source and then if I had multiple they](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m26s)



[would all be in here and I could pick](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m28s)



[among them you know maybe I want to use](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m30s)



[one data source on one page and one data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m31s)



[source on some other page but say that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m33s)



[I'm using this data sports data source](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m36s)



[to apply some kind of security trimming](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m37s)



[for example I don't want people to be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m40s)



[able to bypass this and say hey use the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m43s)



[out-of-the-box one with colas it doesn't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m45s)



[apply the kind of row level security](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m47s)



[what we can do is we can just say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m52s)



[default data source and what this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m55s)



[attribute does is says this data source](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h14m58s)



[replaces the default out-of-the-box](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m01s)



[behavior by colas the default](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m03s)



[out-of-the-box behavior can now never be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m06s)



[exposed you're always operating through](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m08s)



[this data source or some other data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m14s)



[source that you've defined and ideally](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m15s)



[if you do to find other ones you would](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m17s)



[just inherit from this guy if this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m19s)



[the one where you apply your security](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m21s)



[trimming so an example of that security](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m23s)



[trimming and again this is this is kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m25s)



[of row level security so who can see](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m28s)



[which specific rows this this isn't kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m30s)



[of class level security we can say who](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m33s)



[can see to do items period right we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m37s)



[might you know say no hey only admins](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m41s)



[can see to do items and then regardless](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m44s)



[of whether it's to do item number one or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m48s)



[number two it's just only admins could](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m50s)



[see it so so just to talk about that a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m51s)



[little bit you have that level which is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m54s)



[going to put it on the on the properties](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m56s)



[in the API like Andrews shown right now](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h15m59s)



[you then have individual property level](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m03s)



[which is going to put it in your DT OS](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m05s)



[so it will do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m07s)



[trimming specifically so if particular](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m09s)



[you roll can't see a particular property](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m11s)



[that will get security trim so the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m13s)



[assigned to variable will automatically](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m16s)



[be not included and it can't be updated](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m18s)



[unless your role is admin and then you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m20s)



[can do like what Enders showed which is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m22s)



[actual real level security down in the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m24s)



[bottom level down in data source and we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m27s)



[haven't even gotten into the behaviors](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m31s)



[yet so we can say nowhere so item items](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m34s)



[assigned to ID equals user dot get get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m41s)



[user maybe except if they're an admin](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m48s)



[then they can see everybody right or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m51s)



[user dot is and yes in Oh types that's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h16m55s)



[string that's in it yeah we'll just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m10s)



[pretend that our types match](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m16s)



[so this is saying so this get query](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m19s)



[method is kind of the base so this is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m23s)



[kind of where everything starts and then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m24s)



[all the searching and sorting and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m26s)



[filtering and paging are all applied on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m28s)



[top of this query and so the get queries](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m31s)



[kind of the the almost always when you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m35s)



[write a custom data source you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m38s)



[overriding this method and doing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m39s)



[something with it whether that be adding](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m41s)



[some additional include with entity](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m45s)



[framework to say hey you know go grab](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m48s)



[this other related object when you query](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m49s)



[for these so we can say item list by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m52s)



[default coalesce includes all immediate](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h17m59s)



[relations of a type so it's going to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m03s)



[pull back the to-do list and the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m06s)



[application user by default so it will](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m07s)



[this base docket query is what does that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m10s)



[so you could bypass that and just go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m13s)



[directly against DB dot to do items](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m16s)



[and kind of bypass that default behavior](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m21s)



[the gate query method which is the the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m24s)



[only thing it does by default is does](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m26s)



[these first level immediate relation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m28s)



[includes within any framework so if we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m31s)



[did that and now we have this as the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m36s)



[default source oh I just opened edge](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m38s)



[again I'm just considering that a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m41s)



[Freudian slip oh yeah it's it's I just I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m44s)



[really want to open edge I just want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m50s)



[do everything in edge how about we do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m52s)



[you know now if we miss clique we'll](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m56s)



[just open girl](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h18m59s)



[amenda start the app but what I actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m09s)



[did was run the code gen because that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m11s)



[was my last command that I ran which was](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m13s)



[a good thing because we needed to run](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m15s)



[the code gen happy little accident there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m16s)



[umm what this is gonna do is give us no](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m31s)



[items in the list now because of that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m34s)



[secure determing and the fact that we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m37s)



[not we don't actually have users and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m39s)



[because you replace the default data](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m42s)



[source with that other attribute right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m44s)



[yep so it's now forcing the code to go](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m46s)



[through that path and that path is is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m49s)



[doing a check on a user ID that is oh](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m52s)



[actually we didn't even get that far so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h19m55s)



[we get an access denied on that because](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m00s)



[of the class level attributes that I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m02s)



[added here because we're not signed in](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m04s)



[with a user right now at all right we're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m09s)



[effectively anonymous we are so inside](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m11s)



[the template just as a kind of thing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m16s)



[that gets you up and running there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m20s)



[this dummy authentication middleware](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m22s)



[that automatically signs you in as a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m28s)



[user called development user](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m31s)



[the reason we do this is because by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m35s)



[default everything in coalesce is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m37s)



[secured you have to be logged in you can](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m39s)



[on a type by type basis say hey it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m45s)



[okay if completely anonymous not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m48s)



[authenticated users can read this but by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m50s)



[default really we require you to be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m53s)



[logged in so this is here to kind of say](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h20m56s)



[you can kind of get started quickly if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m00s)



[the first thing that you you know you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m02s)



[don't want to tackle is the very first](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m05s)



[thing in your brand new coalesce](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m06s)



[application is adding a bunch of you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m08s)



[know authentication stuff which is kind](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m10s)



[of boring if you kind of just want to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m11s)



[get started on your data model and worry](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m14s)



[about your authentication later](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m16s)



[especially if your authentication is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m18s)



[dependent on your data model right then](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m20s)



[it's kind of you know you want it you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m22s)



[want to be able to get going and get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m24s)



[something out there but there's that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m26s)



[this is one of the steps on so on this](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m30s)



[on this home page here where we kind of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m33s)



[include some like first steps that you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m35s)



[want to do this is the third and final](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m36s)



[one that you're supposed to type you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m38s)



[don't ship your app with the dummy off](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m41s)



[left in right and and if you're you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m43s)



[if you ever intend to add any author](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m48s)



[your app you're gonna very quickly](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m50s)



[notice that that dummy off is there](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m52s)



[because you're gonna say you know why am](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m54s)



[I not being challenged for a login](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m57s)



[screen or what have you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h21m59s)



[why are all of my user it's called](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m03s)



[development user does this coalesce have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m05s)



[sort of we felt that was pretty safe](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m07s)



[that we've built in login stuff does it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m09s)



[Jenna](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m11s)



[like login page stuff for you if that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m12s)



[wasn't in there no it doesn't so that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m15s)



[for that piece we kind of we delegate to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m20s)



[asp net core identity which does those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m23s)



[won't be view pages they'll just be made](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m29s)



[in this case now it's all based on razor](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m31s)



[pages and I think it's styled with](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m33s)



[bootstrap but that's kind of what you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m36s)



[get out of the out of the box if you do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m37s)



[want to do some custom stuff then it's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m41s)



[kind of up to you to do that on a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m44s)



[case-by-case basis I mean](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m45s)



[the most that I would really ever go for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m47s)



[is like a custom login screen maybe a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m49s)



[custom sign-up screen if you if you let](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m51s)



[just you know public users sign up for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m53s)



[your app that's kind of the most that I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h22m56s)



[would probably do is like custom view](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m02s)



[apps just to kind of keep the styling](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m03s)



[consistent but if you go like you know](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m05s)



[setting up two-factor authentication and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m07s)



[all that kind of stuff and user](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m09s)



[management password reset and all that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m11s)



[kind of stuff I say you know hey just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m13s)



[use the out-of-the-box identity stuff or](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m15s)



[expose all that stuff as custom methods](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m18s)



[and coalesce that your access through](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m21s)



[your admin pages and if you have some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m23s)



[kind of admin user who manages the user](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m25s)



[would you which is kind of the the case](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m26s)



[that's been more common for with a lot](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m29s)



[of the apps we've built is that they're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m31s)



[kind of not apps where users are self](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m33s)



[servicing it's kind of a scenario or the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m35s)



[internal line of business apps where](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m39s)



[there's some person in control who is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m41s)



[the one who goes and creates users and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m44s)



[manage the users and so on make sense so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m46s)



[Andrew what would you say would be the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m57s)



[sweet spot for if somebody's saying hey](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h23m58s)



[should I use coalesce for an app or not](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m00s)



[when is it really gonna be a win for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m02s)



[them when have we seen that be true so](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m03s)



[so so one one case is whenever you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m08s)



[writing an internet app I think it's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m12s)



[great win an internet line-of-business](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m16s)



[app where you have just kind of lots of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m20s)



[of data that you're just managing forms](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m23s)



[even if you don't have a lot of that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m26s)



[stuff if it maybe is very configuration](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m28s)



[heavy where you have a lot of of knobs](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m31s)



[and levers that you need to be tweakable](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m35s)



[and and that configuration gets saved it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m37s)



[to a database say that's it's a very](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m39s)



[useful scenario one case to be wary of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m41s)



[using colas and not saying that you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m45s)



[can't do it in this scenario but just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m47s)



[that you kind of have to tread carefully](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m51s)



[I'm just because kind of a lot of what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m52s)



[colas does is kind of exposes things by](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m55s)



[default to logged in users](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h24m57s)



[and some of you have an application](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m01s)



[where you allow public users to just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m02s)



[sign in or sign up for accounts on their](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m05s)



[own and and sign into your application](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m07s)



[you just have to be extra diligent to](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m09s)



[make sure that you secure everything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m12s)



[either with your class-based attributes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m14s)



[or your ro level security or whatever](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m16s)



[kind of thing makes sense for the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m18s)



[application you're building you just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m20s)



[gotta be careful that you don't expose](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m25s)



[things you don't want to especially if](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m27s)



[you're in like a multi-tenant situation](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m28s)



[or something like that yeah so it](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m30s)



[certainly can be used that way and we've](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m36s)



[saw here you know with the attribute](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m38s)



[security and the road level security](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m40s)



[with the data sources that you certainly](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m41s)



[can achieve that level of security](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m43s)



[just because you just have to be](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m48s)



[diligent and and make sure to test](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m51s)



[things well as you would with any other](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m52s)



[application it's yeah the only](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m55s)



[difference is that kind of you know when](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h25m58s)



[you start with a bare-bones ASP nut core](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m00s)



[application you're building everything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m02s)



[yourself by hand manually nothing is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m03s)



[exposed by default](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m07s)



[whereas colas it's kind of you build](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m09s)



[your data model and then you get all](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m11s)



[those really cool awesome stuff which is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m12s)



[great and it's super helpful it's just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m14s)



[kind of then you have to take the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m17s)



[approach here and I gotta go okay you](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m19s)



[know let's say you know scale this back](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m20s)



[a little bit grou users okay you can't](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m22s)



[do that whereas with an internet app](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m25s)



[it's it's kind of a whole lot less of an](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m30s)



[issue you know I mean generally there's](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m32s)



[there's already a pretty high level of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m34s)



[trust there when you're working within](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m36s)



[some organization you're only allowing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m38s)



[users within that organization to get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m42s)



[into the app in the first place those](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m45s)



[cases especially where you have](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m49s)



[something with its higher security we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m50s)



[would probably recommend just going](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m52s)



[ahead and writing services that's that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m53s)



[support all your data that's probably](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m55s)



[going to be the best route for for some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h26m59s)



[public facing stuff yeah and that's what](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m02s)



[we did with with one of the apps that we](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m05s)



[wrote most recently with with colas that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m07s)



[did have a public-facing component is](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m10s)



[that all of the public facing](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m13s)



[interactions are done through service](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m15s)



[classes with with very well defined](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m16s)



[interfaces and then basically everything](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m19s)



[else in colas is is completely walled](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m21s)



[off and to touch up something just](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m24s)



[somewhat tangentially but because you're](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m27s)



[writing essentially back-end code and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m30s)



[then you're writing very front-end code](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m32s)



[that code is usually pretty easy to test](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m34s)



[writing tests are fairly straightforward](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m37s)



[when you're not writing against things](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m40s)



[like controllers and api's that require](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m43s)



[potentially a lot of authorization and a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m45s)



[lot of context into them in order to get](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m47s)



[them to work you can easily test your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m50s)



[back-end then you can easily test your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m52s)



[front-end just using some basic tools](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m54s)



[and so I think getting pretty good unit](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m56s)



[testing coverage is is much simpler](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h27m58s)



[across your specific code assuming that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m02s)



[you're probably not going to be doing a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m05s)



[lot of testing of generated code but](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m07s)



[something like an integration test would](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m09s)



[easily test that the whole stack right](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m11s)



[very quickly yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m13s)



[makes sense Kevin anything else before](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m17s)



[we wrap up I mean there's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m21s)



[other stuff I mean if people are](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m23s)



[interested we could go and talk about](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m24s)



[various I mean there's talk about Roslyn](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m26s)



[we can talk about the whole tree](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m29s)



[trimming stuff that we did with the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m31s)



[includes tree there's there's a number](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m32s)



[of different pieces how some of the the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m35s)



[front-end components work and how to do](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m37s)



[cogeneration there's a whole there's a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m39s)



[whole model piece that is just the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m42s)



[backend that we'll go through and build](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m44s)



[a model of your application at compile](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m46s)



[time and at runtime and it's actually](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m49s)



[one component that can work off of a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m51s)



[compile time or a runtime model and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m55s)



[produce a single usable API model for](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h28m58s)



[you as a consumable model for a](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m03s)



[developer so anyway there's just a bunch](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m05s)



[of stuff like that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m07s)



[yeah no I think what I would say is yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m08s)



[we also people find this interesting and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m11s)



[want to know more drop me a line in the](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m13s)



[comments and I'm sure Grant and Andrew](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m16s)



[will send the end or something I was](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m19s)



[gonna say yeah I'm sure I can probably](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m21s)



[con Grant and Andrew into coming back on](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m23s)



[again hopefully I didn't scare](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m25s)



[too badly but no I think this is great I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m27s)



[will probably be asking you guys some](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m31s)



[questions because I've got an app that](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m33s)



[I'm gonna actually dabble with and try](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m35s)



[using coal s4 and see how it goes and](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m38s)



[given my incredible lack of web skills I](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m42s)



[am sure I will have questions but thank](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m45s)



[you guys for both being willing to come](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m50s)



[on Andrew thank you for going through](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m51s)



[and doing the driving and for your](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m53s)



[insane level of expertise when it comes](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m56s)



[to all of this coal s stuff yeah](https://youtu.be/sfAVWW2qNFg?t=02h29m58s)
