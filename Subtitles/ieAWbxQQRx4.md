[there we go that's the right button I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m00s)



[looking for okay welcome back everyone](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m01s)



[tonight we are going to be doing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m04s)



[something a little different again I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m06s)



[have with me Mike Kern](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m08s)



[he is one of the quality QA tester /](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m10s)



[developer add-in teletext so one of my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m16s)



[co-workers tonight we're going to play](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m18s)



[around with a new concept called](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m21s)



[metamorphic testing this is a fairly new](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m22s)



[concept to both of us so if you haven't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m26s)



[heard of it don't feel bad you're in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m28s)



[good company and so really it's going to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m29s)



[be just kind of playing around and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m32s)



[figuring out what is it good for and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m34s)



[when would it be key to apply it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m36s)



[I guess so with that let me switch over](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m40s)



[here and I can click buttons there we go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m44s)



[Mike you want to say hello hello there](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m48s)



[we are so if you don't see his picture](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m51s)



[that's intentional](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m54s)



[no webcam you just get to hear the voice](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m55s)



[from beneath and actually real quick I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h00m58s)



[forgot to warn you about this Mike](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m01s)



[I'm gonna run subtitles and see how this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m04s)



[works](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m07s)



[all right so we'll see how it goes not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m07s)



[100% confident what it's going to do it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m12s)



[may end up actually not even working](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m16s)



[because I think Skype has captured my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m18s)



[microphone so with that in mind we're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m21s)



[just gonna abandon that thought](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m23s)



[altogether and go without perfect](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m24s)



[because it's not like that app ever had](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m28s)



[any bugs for those people who remember](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m30s)



[last week's stream it was all about](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m34s)



[trying to get that thing working and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m35s)



[delivered and still have not quite](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m36s)



[gotten that point so okay so metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m38s)



[testing so there are a couple blogs that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m42s)



[I'm gonna drop some links in the chat](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m46s)



[here real quick that we're gonna be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m49s)



[looking at this is going to be the the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m50s)



[primary one there to kind of talk](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m52s)



[through so I'm gonna just scroll this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h01m56s)



[thing to the top Mike I don't know if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m00s)



[you want to follow along with it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m02s)



[and kind of go through it I think I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m05s)



[guess I'll go through some of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m08s)



[background stuff and then you can start](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m09s)



[kind of going through the metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m11s)



[testing and sort of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m12s)



[explain it so the first thing to note is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m13s)



[terminology matters right so the the key](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m16s)



[thing with most tests so this is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m20s)



[probably still something that you would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m24s)



[write in either a unit or a functional](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m25s)



[test right and most tests tend to be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m27s)



[what they call Oracle tests meaning you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m31s)



[effectively know the answer ahead of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m34s)



[time I know that given input a I get](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m36s)



[answer B that's the correct answer I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m39s)



[have I have deemed it some people will](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m41s)



[call it like an expert system as well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m43s)



[and that's sort of the the simplest form](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m46s)



[of testing but as your your input start](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m49s)



[to get larger this only gives you sort](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m52s)



[of one data point you know sometimes you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m55s)



[do data driven test and populate it with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m57s)



[a bunch of stuff and that that gets you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h02m58s)



[a little further but it doesn't get you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m01s)



[all the way there is that fair Mike yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m02s)



[yeah that's actually a great way to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m06s)



[character summarize it and you know as](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m08s)



[being in the QA field it's I've watched](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m11s)



[the complexity of the systems that I've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m15s)



[tested just grow pretty much since I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m18s)



[entered you know entered the space like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m21s)



[it's very rare when I get something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m23s)



[that's less complex than something you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m26s)



[know I tested before so this this popped](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m29s)



[up on my radar kind of an well Kelly](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m31s)



[adams actually was when I linked it to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m35s)



[me](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m37s)



[never coworker of ours and it it stayed](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m38s)



[on my radar as I've encountered some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m41s)



[interesting challenges actually one of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m44s)



[our current clients which I'll talk](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m46s)



[about in a little bit okay so usually at](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m48s)



[least the way this article progresses is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m51s)



[beyond the the Oracle or the expert](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m53s)



[system test that you go into generative](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m55s)



[testing or the way I've always heard it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h03m58s)



[called is property based testing where](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m00s)



[you no longer test for a given point you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m01s)



[test with some sort of generative point](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m05s)



[and so in this case they're they're just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m08s)



[using random generated data I usually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m10s)



[favor something like a library called](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m13s)



[bogus and this is one of those areas](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m15s)



[where you start to get some people](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m18s)



[that'll cringe a little bit because a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m20s)



[lot of people don't like random data or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m21s)



[I should say purely random data going in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m25s)



[to their unit tests because it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m27s)



[introduces variability so you know you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m29s)



[run you run your test one time they all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m31s)



[pass you run them again and they fail](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m33s)



[and then you go oh shoot let me look at](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m35s)



[that failure and you can't refuse it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m37s)



[again right and so usually having some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m39s)



[sort of generated data is fine but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m42s)



[usually people prefer to be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m44s)



[deterministic so that if it fails I can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m46s)



[hit rerun and see the failure and debug](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m49s)



[it because it's really frustrating to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m51s)



[try to debug something that happens you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m52s)



[know one in ten times and so in this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m54s)



[case you start going through and finding](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h04m58s)



[properties of your function so in this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m00s)



[case they're your met they're measuring](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m02s)



[distance and so they're going through](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m03s)



[and they're saying oh okay distance](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m05s)



[between two points should always be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m07s)



[positive or I should say should be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m08s)



[non-negative and just going through and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m10s)



[doing that but that doesn't that doesn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m13s)



[quite cover all your cases right because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m15s)



[all this this doesn't guarantee that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m18s)



[you've actually gotten the distance](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m21s)



[between two points it just guarantees](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m22s)



[that you've returned some value right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m23s)



[that fits the property so both of these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m26s)



[sort of start to leave you with blind](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m30s)



[spots and more importantly as they call](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m33s)



[out in the article finding the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m37s)



[properties of your function isn't always](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m39s)



[as trivial as just looking at you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m42s)



[looking at the function and knowing that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m45s)



[it's distance right hmm that's not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m47s)



[necessarily straightforward what else](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m49s)



[anything else I missed on that one Mike](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m52s)



[or is that kind of kind of cover it um I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m54s)



[think that covers it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h05m59s)



[let's yeah I mean that's what's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m00s)



[interesting is we're actually at a point](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m04s)



[in in a lot of the efforts I've dealt](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m06s)



[with where we're struggling through that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m10s)



[exact issue right now where we're moving](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m12s)



[away from Oracle's and where we're like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m15s)



[okay so but what are the properties that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m17s)



[we should be testing here so it's it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m19s)



[interesting that this articles laid out](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m22s)



[kind of an a very similar progression to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m24s)



[to how I've seen a lot of projects play](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m27s)



[out in my own learning actually I should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m30s)



[to make it personal that's it's perfect](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m33s)



[so do you then want to dive in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m37s)



[I know the article then dives in sort of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m40s)



[the the motivation behind it and then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m41s)



[starting to talk about metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m44s)



[testing do you want to kind of do an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m47s)



[intro there yeah so based on my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m49s)



[understanding and finding some finding](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m54s)



[really good examples of this is actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h06m58s)



[kind of hard there's not a whole lot of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m00s)



[people that I found or that are doing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m03s)



[this in concrete fashion that that are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m05s)



[also putting that information out in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m07s)



[public but as so as far as I understand](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m10s)



[the idea behind metamorphic testing is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m12s)



[instead of having an Oracle or instead](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m15s)



[of having a property we instead use](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m18s)



[these things called metamorphic relation](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m21s)



[and that's when we exercise the system](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m24s)



[if we exercise the system in a different](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m28s)



[way we should be able to know if the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m31s)



[result for the first application or the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m35s)



[for the first test if you will should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m42s)



[relate somehow to the second run and the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m45s)



[actually a really great example that I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m50s)



[just read earlier today when I was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m53s)



[prepping for this is super super basic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m55s)



[super duper simple but the I think it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h07m59s)



[the reflexive property in math I might](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m03s)



[have that wrong it's been a long time](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m07s)



[since I studied those dito but if you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m08s)



[think of it in a super duper basic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m12s)



[scenario if I have let's say a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m15s)



[calculator app and I put in five plus](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m17s)



[four let's say for some reason I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m20s)



[know what the answer is gonna be but by](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m22s)



[the reflexive property again I think by](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m24s)



[whatever that property is called I know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m28s)



[since this addition I could put in four](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m30s)



[plus five it would be the same so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m33s)



[instead of having a test that says five](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m35s)



[plus four equals nine I have a test that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m37s)



[says five plus four equals something and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m39s)



[the next test is well four plus five](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m42s)



[should equal that something then so in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m44s)



[this way instead of knowing the output](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m49s)



[i I'm instead basically using the system](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m53s)



[to check itself and that's a super duper](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m56s)



[simplistic example another one that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h08m58s)



[actually in this article about working](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m01s)



[at now one of the case studies I was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m03s)



[able the pub that the whole thing was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m07s)



[published without you know having to to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m09s)



[go through a paywall or register](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m12s)



[anything I don't which one it was many](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m14s)



[more for testing for a restful Web API](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m19s)



[is actually that one it was yeah so the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m21s)



[example that they use is wet api's and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m25s)



[the one that really clicked for me was I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m29s)



[think it was the Spotify API they would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m32s)



[do a search for a term and that returns](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m38s)



[a set of data well if you sort that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m41s)



[search you should get what is it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m44s)



[equivalent but not equals you should get](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m48s)



[the same data but in a different order](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m50s)



[right yeah yeah if you do a filter you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m51s)



[should get a subset of that data if you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m55s)



[broaden your search term you should get](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m57s)



[a superset of that data so it's it's you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h09m59s)



[know when we start looking at these more](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m03s)



[complex scenarios where it's like hey if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m04s)



[I google search automated testing mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m06s)



[I don't know what's gonna come back in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m10s)



[that search it's probably changing all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m13s)



[the time based on you know when people](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m16s)



[create websites and when they you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m18s)



[update the text but if I do that search](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m20s)



[and then you know I sort it or I filter](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m23s)



[it or I do a more specific search let's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m25s)



[say selenium automated testing for less](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m28s)



[specific search maybe software testing I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m30s)



[can start to compare these results](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m32s)



[against each other to look for some some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m35s)



[interesting behavior so in my mind I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m37s)



[don't I I don't think it's the end-all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m42s)



[be-all hey this is the future of testing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m46s)



[but I do think it could totally serve an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m48s)



[important you be it a very important](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m51s)



[tool when we start looking at very](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m54s)



[complex or or opaque systems got it and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h10m56s)



[I think some of it they kind of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m02s)



[described it under that motivation](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m04s)



[section and I think it's this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m06s)



[same problem that you hit on there is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m07s)



[it's similar to the the property based](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m09s)



[testing except for on property based](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m12s)



[testing you know something about your](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m14s)



[inputs right your your provided them](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m16s)



[where in this case the the inputs are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m18s)



[coming from the system as well as the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m22s)



[result of exercise in the system and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m23s)



[then it's just a matter of effectively](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m26s)



[declaring the relationship between those](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m29s)



[two mm-hmm yeah and and the that article](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m31s)



[I mentioned the RESTful API is one they](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m36s)



[they actually do a really good job of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m40s)



[laying out the metamorphic relationships](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m42s)



[that they identified as being important](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m44s)



[for their tests which may be different](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m46s)



[depending on the the sort of system that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m48s)



[you're testing I you know they went](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m50s)



[through I think there were a dozen of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m53s)



[them things like equivalent equals](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m54s)



[subset superset Union you know all sorts](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m56s)



[of different things that you could use](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h11m59s)



[to compare these results right basically](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m01s)



[I mean so again it's been a long time](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m05s)



[since I've done Maps as well but it it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m08s)



[it boils down to a lot of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m10s)



[mathematical set theory relationship](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m14s)



[right you know I've got a set of I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m16s)



[because I got the PDF in front of me the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m19s)



[set of three things you know they've got](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m21s)



[track ABC and then various tests against](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m23s)



[it mm-hmm okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m27s)



[I mean that I I think I think that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m30s)



[mostly makes sense to me do we well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m33s)



[we'll come back to that in a minute so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m38s)



[article has a bunch of case studies and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m40s)



[then is there anything more in here I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m43s)



[think this is this kind of falls down](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m46s)



[here again if people haven't seen this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m50s)



[before don't feel bad something in the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m52s)



[back of my mind makes me suspect that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m55s)



[some people may have done something like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m57s)



[this and just not really been able to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h12m58s)



[put a term to it but I think having sort](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m00s)



[of a well-defined blueprint I guess who](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m03s)



[makes it makes a lot of sense so with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m08s)



[that sort of in mind and actually hang](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m12s)



[on before I get before I get too deep](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m14s)



[off in the woods one obvious application](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m16s)



[of this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m19s)



[from artificial intelligence so I'm just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m20s)



[gonna drop one more link in the chat for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m24s)



[people who are interested so basically](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m27s)



[being able to verify your machine](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m31s)



[learning algorithm is behaving the way](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m32s)



[you expect right because that again you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m34s)



[you go through and train up your model](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m37s)



[and then you you have to know is is it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m41s)



[working right and figuring out how that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m43s)



[works so this article kind of dives into](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m47s)



[that and how they applied it so if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m49s)



[people are interested in that that is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m52s)



[also another interesting one so I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m56s)



[I'm gonna leave this guy kind of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m58s)



[floating around and then I think we'll](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h13m59s)



[dive into maybe just trying to write](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m01s)



[some code with this and see what happens](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m03s)



[so if people are interested I I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m07s)



[be working out of this repo here it's a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m10s)



[simple helper repo the I use it to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m14s)



[generate the release documentation every](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m17s)



[time I put out a material design ins a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m22s)



[mole release so that's sort of the base](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m24s)



[but we're going to ignore all of that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m26s)



[code and I'm just using it because it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m28s)



[already conveniently set up to do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m30s)



[github integration that way we've got a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m34s)



[source of data or there's a lot of data](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m35s)



[and we can query stuff out of it that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m38s)



[make sense okay so where are you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m41s)



[thinking we want to start with this Mike](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m46s)



[and I'm realizing I set this thing up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m47s)



[like just to invoke a main method but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m49s)



[I'm wondering if we should deviate from](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m53s)



[that and just go and do a unit test does](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h14m56s)



[that make more sense I think so yeah so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m02s)



[let's why not let's go through and add](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m05s)



[some tests so new project do you care](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m08s)



[about the testing framework and must](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m14s)



[test okay yep and it's fine great so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m16s)



[go for tests great create I'll name it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m24s)



[this way so that if I ever do ad CI](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m30s)



[it'll get picked up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m32s)



[okay so there's gonna be a couple things](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m33s)



[that we're gonna have to do really quick](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m37s)



[so I'm gonna just in the interest of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m39s)



[doing this a public static class github](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m41s)



[and I'm gonna just quickly go and grab](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m49s)



[that same octo kit library that I was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m52s)



[using on the other side to do just bring](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h15m56s)



[that in real quick is your screen](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m00s)



[following along as I'm moving around](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m05s)



[Mike know I have to know where to go but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m06s)



[I saw the project pink I saw the project](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m11s)



[pop-up so okay I was gonna say I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m14s)



[if you right-click and just follow my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m15s)



[user you'll probably stick with my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m20s)



[cursor wherever it goes I think I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m22s)



[know that for a fact but Oh former](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m25s)



[participant oh here we go yeah I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m29s)



[that lets you because I'm going to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m31s)



[bounce around a little bit here wait](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m33s)



[this is oh I oh that's fun](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m41s)



[doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo trying to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m52s)



[decide how I do this if it's worth going](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m53s)



[through that I'm just trying I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m55s)



[ultimately just gonna wrap this thing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m58s)



[off in a new little bit but I think what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h16m59s)



[I'm just gonna do is this right I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m02s)



[I'm just gonna do and sure let's just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m08s)



[add a reference back to the other](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m13s)



[project I don't want to think too hard](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m14s)



[about this great and I guess I can put](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m16s)



[this back if I'm gonna do a hard](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m21s)



[reference so I'm gonna move this guy out](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m23s)



[here in just a minute and more](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m26s)



[importantly I'm just gonna go in hard](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m28s)



[code the the the key that we need for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m30s)



[the access token elsewhere so we don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m32s)



[have to you know do this and then I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m37s)



[not going to check it in unlike what I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m41s)



[did last week where I promptly and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m43s)



[repeatedly exposed my key and got really](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m46s)



[really good at regenerating my key](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m48s)



[I really really really don't want to do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m54s)



[that over and over now so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h17m57s)



[just move you off into your own file I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m00s)



[gonna open you up and I'm gonna move you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m04s)



[off the screen there's the kickin step](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m06s)



[that I always forgot to do beforehand](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m09s)



[and if I remember right I've got my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m11s)



[other file sitting over here too and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m14s)



[look you two can be friends great so I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m16s)



[need magical access token match Alexis](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m20s)



[token great okay so I get up client](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m25s)



[client gets get up Wow well people are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m30s)



[watching so you know I know there's and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m41s)



[I'm starting to now question my github](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m44s)



[should probably sorry my OCD is gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m48s)



[bother me if I don't fix that age](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m52s)



[uh yes please yeah great](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h18m54s)

[what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m13s)



[where did my file go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m17s)



[whose literally just their moment ago](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m23s)



[huh that's a new feature so one second](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m28s)



[open containing folder and yeah undo](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m33s)



[undo undo nope um okay that's new and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m39s)



[different I'm pretty sure I didn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m49s)



[delete it on accident I would appreciate](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m51s)



[that but I've never seen that happened](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m55s)



[before so I'm gonna just once again move](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h19m58s)



[you into your own file drag you not onto](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m01s)



[the main screen](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m04s)



[come over to here just snag that little](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m05s)



[guy right boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m08s)



[drop that in replace the access token](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m12s)



[with a hard-coded string and put that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m16s)



[guy in paste that's something else on my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m22s)



[clipboard so I don't accidentally hit](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m26s)



[paste on the other side because I've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m28s)



[been known just screw that up okay so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m29s)



[and then I should make it public so it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m34s)



[stops whining there okay we have a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m36s)



[client what are we gonna test or how do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m41s)



[you want to test well because I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m44s)



[this is this is where the interesting or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m50s)



[I should say where the rubber meets the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m52s)



[road and where we actually have to uh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m54s)



[yeah go through and say yeah see we've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h20m55s)



[got lots of options are we pointed to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m00s)



[the test holds repo I believe well yes](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m02s)



[and no we're pointed at no repos at the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m09s)



[moment but we can be pointed out](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m11s)



[whatever you would like um you want to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m12s)



[you want to use the Intel attack test](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m16s)



[tools one yeah I might as well I've been](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m17s)



[doing a lot of work in there this year](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m19s)



[great okay so I think depending on what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m20s)



[calls you want to make I think it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m26s)



[client repository yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m28s)



[and it wants an owner of Intel attack](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m32s)



[and it wants a repo name of test tools](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m35s)



[all right so repo I'll see a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m41s)



[synchronously things you see tasks sure](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m51s)



[great okay so in theory we have a repo](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h21m58s)



[now don't we hmm okay um so I guess and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m03s)



[then this is where again my the the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m15s)



[metamorphic testing bit gets a little a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m18s)



[little weird I guess we really need to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m21s)



[just decide on what what exactly we want](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m23s)



[to verify do we want to just verify pull](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m26s)



[requests I was yeah that's what I was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m30s)



[trying to decide it's like we've got I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m33s)



[mean we've got multiple different data](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m35s)



[points we could look at for quests](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m37s)



[commits collaborators files egg-like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m40s)



[what's gonna be most fun let's do issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m47s)



[I think because we've got a little we've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m54s)



[got a lot more criteria that we can work](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m56s)



[with on issues right because you've done](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h22m58s)



[open issues you've got closed issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m00s)



[you've got authors mm-hmm the sets big](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m02s)



[enough that we can or I should say it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m06s)



[big enough to be interesting but small](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m08s)



[enough that if we wanted to grok the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m10s)



[whole thing it's not a big deal all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m11s)



[right good cool so what do we want to do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m14s)



[just pull back all reap all issues to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m19s)



[begin with yeah I think so let's see the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m21s)



[client issue](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m25s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m29s)



[I think what we want get all for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m31s)



[repository Hey look at that and actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m35s)



[yeah so here's what I'm gonna do I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m38s)



[gonna just do this private client string](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m40s)



[owner gets tella tech I should spell our](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m46s)



[company's name correctly because that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m52s)



[would be embarrassing uh-huh let's see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m54s)



[private Conn string repo name all right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h23m58s)



[yeah there's that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m02s)



[okay so I don't know if we actually need](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m06s)



[this because we can just query](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m10s)



[indirectly with that information so we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m12s)



[can do let's see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m15s)



[owner we can do well actually though do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m17s)



[we want open and closed](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m25s)



[I don't well here we're gonna try this I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m26s)



[don't know what this is going to return](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m28s)



[so I don't want some of these api's you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m30s)



[have to pass in a request object if you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m32s)



[want to get like you close things to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m34s)



[okay so that gets more interesting I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m35s)



[guess so find out I might have to go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m38s)



[turn that off real quick I'm sorry that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m45s)



[is driving me absolutely bonkers the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m47s)



[resharper settings that is P C](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m51s)



[extensions resharper options where is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m54s)



[this stupid type name stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h24m58s)



[oh boy a note a typescript C name](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m05s)



[perhaps let's see editor this is I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m13s)



[necessarily know where it is I want to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m22s)



[go turn it off I want to go turn it off](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m24s)



[I just don't know where it is show](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m26s)



[parameter name hints I I think I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m29s)



[like in late hints at all ah there we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m38s)



[are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m41s)



[that's what I wanted okay all in lay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m41s)



[hints off okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m44s)



[so there's that so this will just get us](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m46s)



[all issued well we think we'll get us](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m49s)



[all issues so to do did you do it is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m50s)



[worth noting we might have to be mildly](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m55s)



[careful github only allows you to query](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m56s)



[for or I should say only allows you to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h25m59s)



[do 5,000 queries an hour all right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m02s)



[believe it or not it's actually a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m06s)



[surprisingly easy thing to hit because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m08s)



[some of these things actually chew up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m10s)



[more than one oh yeah so you technically](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m11s)



[get 5,000 API calls but with this client](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m16s)



[library sometimes one method invocation](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m20s)



[is multiple API calls gotcha so thinking](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m22s)



[thinking thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m27s)



[thinking I do want to point out real](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m29s)



[quick that in PS live share I really](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m32s)



[appreciate that when you debug I get to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m35s)



[see your stack and locals and all that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m37s)



[yes yes yes wonderful absolutely](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m39s)



[wonderful I did not pay attention to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m42s)



[what that was but that gave me back 14](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m45s)



[issues I think that probably sounds like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m49s)



[just open it's interesting that it gave](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m52s)



[me 14 when I see 13 in the GUI](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m55s)



[oh well then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h26m59s)



[that's real oh wait is there a second](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m08s)



[maybe there's a second page and I'm just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m10s)



[no now I'm curious where the set differs](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m15s)



[right you find a bug in this API right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m19s)



[here I'm gonna be shocked I'm not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m22s)



[supposed to be the way this goes right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m26s)



[29 30 34 36 48 49 52 53](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m28s)



[there's no 61 what okay so what's the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m36s)



[issue 61 is it giving back the open PR](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m41s)



[ah it's giving back and open PR with it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m45s)



[oh that's what's happening because right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m49s)



[because they share the same ideas uh-huh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m52s)



[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h27m55s)



[interesting okay so no kind of feels](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m00s)



[weird](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m04s)



[what is 61 have on it that would does it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m05s)



[tell us anything about if it's a PR or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m09s)



[not doesn't seem to yeah I mean you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m12s)



[could kind of divine it based on the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m19s)



[like the the URL stuff whether it's you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m21s)



[know pull that is yeah but otherwise](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m25s)



[there's no I don't know so here's the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m29s)



[other part that gets me is I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m32s)



[necessarily know if this is expected or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m33s)



[not right right is like maybe this is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m35s)



[intentional because I know these things](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m40s)



[very intentionally share the same](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m42s)



[backing source for me in tracking it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m46s)



[because when you open a PR it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m49s)



[effectively does uses this to like track](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m51s)



[the comments and everything on it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m53s)



[mmm-hmm maybe that's the reason for it I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m54s)



[think for now we'll just assume that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m57s)



[it's correct okay so if we want to get](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h28m58s)



[deal all I think we got it let's let's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m00s)



[change this up right I think this is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m02s)



[gonna be mildly problematic so I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m04s)



[we have to do this first I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m06s)



[change let's see I want to just collapse](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m09s)



[solution Explorer I don't need that open](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m11s)



[okay so owner there and repo name here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m13s)



[cuz I don't think there was an overload](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m20s)



[here that took the is usually there's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m22s)



[like an options or a request class II](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m24s)



[gotcha yeah so but all of the all the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m26s)



[ones that take in options want a repo ID](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m29s)



[which would which means we have to have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m31s)



[the repo ID yeah but we now have that so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m34s)



[now we go repo ID all right and then we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m37s)



[can go new API options and I think this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m40s)



[gives me no that's just paging stuff so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m45s)



[it's gonna be it's gonna be on a quest](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m49s)



[object so that's gonna be Oscar issue](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m51s)



[request now I'm just gonna we're gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m56s)



[refactor this out there we go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h29m59s)



[our quest gets I think this guy actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m02s)



[has the the set of all of our data right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m08s)



[me perfect I think if we look let's see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m10s)



[labels mentions source state that sounds](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m16s)



[more like what I want all cuz I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m21s)



[sure most most of the API calls from](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m23s)



[when I've worked with the github stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m27s)



[is gonna default just like opened type](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m28s)



[thing which is it's probably a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m31s)



[reasonable default very rarely do you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m34s)



[want to like query everything since](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m36s)



[since the dawn of time right in that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m37s)



[case that's exactly what we want so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m40s)



[let's see that should do that that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m43s)



[should do that debug again okay so now](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h30m45s)



[we get back sixty three things which is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m00s)



[a lot but I've got a bunch of opened and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m04s)



[closed items in here you know sort of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m06s)



[makes sense okay we're gonna assume](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m09s)



[that's correct](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m11s)



[works for me](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m13s)



[okay so how do we want to go through and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m15s)



[structure this because I assume what we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m16s)



[want to do is in the interest of not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m18s)



[like pounding on the API and burning](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m21s)



[through this as fast as we can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m23s)



[maybe we should some sort of setup that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m26s)



[grabs and caches these issues and then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m31s)



[we can do follow-up requests yeah that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m34s)



[seems good to you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m37s)



[so absolutely and kind of in my in my my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m39s)



[hand as I was thinking about this that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m43s)



[that would that seems reasonable to do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m45s)



[because I mean it if we were to read](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m48s)



[refetch these or you know that initial](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m51s)



[set every single time that it just seems](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m54s)



[like an unnecessary number of calls](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m56s)



[I completely agree so I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h31m58s)



[think of what I want this guy I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m02s)



[I've in the interest of simplicity right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m05s)



[now right I think I just write a simple](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m08s)



[static method that gives me back a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m10s)



[read-only list of issues right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m12s)



[I mean yes there's ways to optimize this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m16s)



[get all issues and it'll take in an i](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m20s)



[github client will just dump this in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m24s)



[right hmm and then we don't have to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m29s)



[think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m32s)



[poof that so we get rid of this oh I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m34s)



[suppose I have to make it an async](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m38s)



[method it's there up hey resharper](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m40s)



[thanks nice that's what I wanted right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m46s)



[there I was wondering if that was built](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m49s)



[in uh get all issues I love it when](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m52s)



[resharper just does the code that I want](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h32m59s)



[okay perfect](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m02s)



[nice oh we got actually return the value](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m06s)



[I guess Oh issues that we might refactor](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m10s)



[this one more time when we get to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m18s)



[running multiple tests because I suspect](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m19s)



[I don't want to retrieve this every time](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m21s)



[yeah makes sense cool so I guess we've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m23s)



[got a couple things we could try right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m29s)



[mm-hmm so well so one we could act so if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m31s)



[we wanted to continue on the same I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m38s)



[guess issues API like we could we could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m40s)



[very easily go through and do sorting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m45s)



[mm-hmm yeah sorting created by I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m48s)



[remember is there an assigned to I was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m56s)



[just assigned yeah there isn't a sign II](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h33m58s)



[in a creator but I I think the problem](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m00s)



[is is at least in the this repo I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m02s)



[think we've necessarily assigned a lot](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m04s)



[of things to the people explicitly](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m06s)



[gotcha which may end up biting us a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m08s)



[little bit make sense and that's that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m12s)



[fine but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m15s)



[so yeah I mean that like the immediate](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m18s)



[super straightforward one would be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m22s)



[created by a person or sorted by some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m25s)



[value right well I mean if we want to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m31s)



[filter down right so you're close first](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m35s)



[yeah I mean really right so did to do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m38s)



[let's see it's data row isn't it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m46s)



[yeah and so item state filter open and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m50s)



[closed right because in theory I can do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m55s)



[this as a single test mm-hmm run the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h34m58s)



[same yeah and I can do item State filter](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m01s)



[will call it filter all right and we'll](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m07s)



[just pass this in and we should give our](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m11s)



[unit test a better name because test](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m14s)



[method one is not descriptive how about](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m16s)



[filtering returns subset yeah that I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m19s)



[mean that if I go back to that initial](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m25s)



[article and I'm just gonna for the sake](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m27s)



[of making sure since my chat doesn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m32s)



[stay up forever if anybody's interested](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m36s)



[the metamorphic testing that we're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m38s)



[looking at the relationship in this case](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m39s)



[subset hmm and so let's take oh you'll](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m42s)



[want to change that second day to row to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m47s)



[closed thank you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m50s)



[this is this is why we pair and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h35m52s)



[realize I am an idiot and I actually do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m00s)



[want that line of code so closed right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m04s)



[so I want to get all issues and then I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m07s)



[want to do this again right yep oh oh I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m15s)



[D](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m22s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m27s)



[do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m31s)



[do-do-do-do-do trying to decide the best](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m34s)



[way to do this without hating my life](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m37s)



[right you know what I mean if you want](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m40s)



[quick and easy we could debug real quick](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m55s)



[and just grab it in hard coat it look at](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h36m57s)



[that that sounds like a great idea and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m01s)



[we'll even constant long alright so I'll](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m05s)



[put this in real quick boom okay and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m12s)



[then what we are going to do is change](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m18s)



[this guy out to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m22s)



[actually you know what let's do this no](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m29s)



[so we still change it right but I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m32s)



[what I do is rather than having this be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m34s)



[Const](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m36s)



[mmm I see yeah just go and look it up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m44s)



[right yeah and we are not dealing with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m52s)



[air cases right now because you should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m56s)



[deal with air cases yes always deal with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h37m59s)



[air case don't do like I'm doing bad and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m01s)



[because I just I can't help it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m07s)



[I have to just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m10s)



[I see race condition but whatever okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m15s)



[test running in parallel race condition](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m18s)



[introduced okay so let's let's figure](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m21s)



[out how do we want to actually do this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m23s)



[now so we basically need to compare](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m25s)



[these items right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m28s)



[I think let's see I believe all of these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m31s)



[have an ID on them right okay I believe](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m37s)



[so yeah great so we could just do a set](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m40s)



[of the IDS so how about m/s test may it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m43s)



[it's been a little bit since I've used](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m48s)



[MS test but I know like X unit has an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m50s)



[assert that compares lists MSS might](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m54s)



[have the same it does it has a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m58s)



[collection assert on it the problem](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h38m59s)



[being well I guess it does have is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m03s)



[subset of right okay so all issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m07s)



[select X dot ID to list](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m13s)



[and I'm gonna I'm gonna just break this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m21s)



[onto multiple lines cuz this is gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m23s)



[get too big especially at this font size](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m24s)



[so that's the superset so we need this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m27s)



[to be issues select write x dot ID and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m32s)



[to list](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m42s)



[something like that yeah okay well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h39m50s)



[filtering returning subset run tests and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m00s)



[I realize I just hit run rather than](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m04s)



[debug so we're gonna just see what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m07s)



[happens we win this is remarkably easy](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m08s)



[though I am noticing if you have a full](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m18s)



[set like this uh-huh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m21s)



[if you have a full set it does feel like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m26s)



[you almost want to cash it and I do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m29s)



[wonder about things like well I guess](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m32s)



[you would never test in an environment](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m38s)



[where something else would potentially](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m40s)



[be modifying your data right preferably](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m41s)



[not we we have run into that at a couple](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m44s)



[of clients](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m51s)



[one or two and it's I don't have a good](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m52s)



[answer for that and that you know at one](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h40m59s)



[of our clients they're a bigger](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m03s)



[enterprise so you know their systems are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m04s)



[set up to facilitate a lot of traffic so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m08s)



[in that particular client like we query](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m13s)



[for every single little thing like I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m16s)



[just got them running a couple of tests](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m19s)



[where I think I queried 10 11 12 times](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m21s)



[in a single test just for different](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m25s)



[points of data and it's okay because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m27s)



[it's like well you know we expect that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m29s)



[that there's traffic yeah I mean you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m31s)



[know definitely best practice or our](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m35s)



[best environment setup would be let's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m38s)



[have our own test environment where the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m40s)



[data is not going to change out from](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m42s)



[underneath us](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m43s)



[don't mind me some for slim](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m49s)



[just you know I'm twitching and I have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h41m58s)



[to I have to I have to deal with this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m02s)



[hmm so let's see what do you owe](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m06s)



[and I'm gonna just do this do this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m28s)



[actually you know what the try finally](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m42s)



[is really not necessary it probably is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m43s)



[in production grade code but in this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m46s)



[case if things blow up they're inside of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m49s)



[unit tests and I kind of want that right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m51s)



[mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m53s)



[so fail fast boom so let's do this and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h42m54s)



[I'm just gonna because no one's ever](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m05s)



[been bitten by having a cache of right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m08s)



[never ever for those people who haven't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m17s)



[heard me say it before I usually refer](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m21s)



[to cache as failure point here so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m23s)



[because that's generally what happens](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m28s)



[issues know we'll go and look them up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m32s)



[all right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m35s)



[uh what are you squawking at oh you want](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m52s)



[to be able to set it okay fine](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m56s)



[details details details details](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h43m59s)



[okay I feel like I'm bike shitting here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m03s)



[okay what are we testing now well now](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m06s)



[that I have to go and do threading all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m13s)



[right so we've got a doobie run that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m17s)



[test by the way we did but I will](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m19s)



[happily run it again because it executed](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m21s)



[very quickly and I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m23s)



[executed in parallel or not it's kind of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m27s)



[fast mmm I said I'm that might be one](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m29s)



[oversight and live share I never saw](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m32s)



[test Explorer update oh that is a good](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m34s)



[program do you see it now no okay okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m39s)



[well I'll just I'll just provide that if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m44s)



[something fails he'll kill me got it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m46s)



[and this is something that so I know you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m48s)



[can't see it here but in test explorer](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m52s)



[right now even though we have these two](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m56s)



[data rows it shows three results one for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h44m59s)



[each of the individual items and then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m03s)



[one that's the summation of the two so I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m05s)



[know in the past this has confused](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m08s)



[people and when we asked this was an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m10s)



[intentional design decision and I gave](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m13s)



[the feedback that design was confusing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m16s)



[and so far nothing's changed that's all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m19s)



[I can say for certain](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m25s)



[all right so okay so let's see do we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m26s)



[want to stick with issues or move on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m31s)



[because I mean there's there's I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m32s)



[looking at the API Doc's right now and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m35s)



[there's they've got a lot of stuff we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m37s)



[could look at just with issues yeah I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m39s)



[mean I guess what I'm more interested in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m41s)



[is let's see about like we could stick](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m43s)



[with issues but I'm thinking let's not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m45s)



[do necessarily a subset right uh-huh I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m47s)



[thinking we we do something a little](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m50s)



[different uh-huh okay let's do a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m53s)



[different relationship because I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m57s)



[that's I think that's more interesting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h45m58s)



[right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m00s)



[Oh fair enough so we could do a not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m01s)



[equals just off the top of my head I can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m03s)



[think it could think of well see this is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m05s)



[the part where I'm a little hazy on on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m10s)



[metamorphic testing is is it a valid](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m11s)



[test free to query for all the issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m13s)



[I've reported and all the issues let's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m17s)



[say mark is reported and make sure that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m21s)



[they're not the same does that tell us](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m23s)



[anything interesting so that so that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m26s)



[actually raises a good question and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m31s)



[think the answer is yeah I should have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m33s)



[left that hold on let me grab that one](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m35s)



[where you did the this one because the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m37s)



[that white paper that you cited I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m40s)



[thought I saw a disjoint as let's seize](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m43s)



[equivalence equality subset disjoint](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m47s)



[which we just did subset disjoint where](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m54s)



[intersects immense sources source and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h46m57s)



[follow-up outputs should be empty so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m00s)



[this pattern is applicable when queries](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m04s)



[notes can be divided into disjoint](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m06s)



[partitions right no item in common okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m08s)



[yeah I mean this seems fairly simple](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m12s)



[right huh sweet like they were saying 2d](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m17s)



[and 3d via so I mean we could we can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m21s)



[stick with something simple right so we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m23s)



[could just say I'll shoot I'm gonna I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m26s)



[can't I can't resist the urge to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m32s)



[refactor because right because I am](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m34s)



[I want this one this signature right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m44s)



[here but I want it to be this and I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m50s)



[gonna just move you down and we're gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m56s)



[go with an overload that takes in an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h47m58s)



[item state filter right mm-hm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m01s)



[and we'll call it filter and we're just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m04s)



[gonna grab all of you and we're just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m07s)



[gonna blindly blindly fire this guy off](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m11s)



[you're gonna pass in a filter and you're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m15s)



[gonna return hmm all right and now we've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m20s)



[got something that's much simpler to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m23s)



[work with this guy just becomes get all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m25s)



[issues I don't like the fact that we're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m29s)



[just using stuff but whatever](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m33s)



[the whole point is testing metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m35s)



[stuff and oh got to call the right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m40s)



[overload okay so there's that and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m43s)



[think I can just call in to hit here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m48s)



[right oh wait](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m51s)



[get all issues client filter no matter](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m52s)



[just just keep deleting code deleting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h48m58s)



[code okay but now we want to do this one](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m00s)



[right what do we call this open and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m03s)



[closed issues are disjoint maybe yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m09s)



[is that fair yep so let's see bar open](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m19s)



[issues gets a weight get all issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m23s)



[client open](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m28s)



[and we'll do closed closed hmm and I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m33s)



[gonna leave them as var because and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m43s)



[don't separate my lines and so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m45s)



[collection assert are not equal all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m48s)



[right the thing well isn't the same as](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h49m55s)



[not as disjointed right I was just gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m01s)



[say the thing I don't know is does not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m04s)



[equal](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m06s)



[is it gonna match on we almost need like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m07s)



[a is not like a not ne er well so you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m11s)



[can kind of get it well so well here's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m15s)



[what you can do right because in both](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m19s)



[case well of our open IDs gets new a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m23s)



[hash set int alright I think it's gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m29s)



[be long and we'll just pass it open](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m36s)



[issues and once again just grab the ID](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m41s)



[off of it right mm-hm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m44s)



[oh it isn't it lovely note to self the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m46s)



[API is gonna have problems when they](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m51s)



[want some poor guy because I believe](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m52s)



[hash set has is superset overlaps said](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h50m55s)



[equals because I think what you could do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m08s)



[is you could do an intersect between](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m12s)



[these two and then assert that they're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m14s)



[right because if you intersect Oh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m17s)



[actually there's an intersect here not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m20s)



[it okay so here's what you do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m24s)



[collection assert empty or is it just on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m26s)



[the assert class assert](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m31s)



[sir sir tis true open issues select X](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m34s)



[dot id intersect with closed issues dot](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m47s)



[ID](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m53s)



[I'm sorry intersect closed issues select](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h51m55s)



[and I'm gonna update I already have to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m02s)



[move this and make it cleaner dot any](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m05s)



[right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m13s)



[because hmm grab the open issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m14s)



[intersected with the closed issues if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m18s)



[there are none](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m20s)



[okay let's see if it passes](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m28s)



[ooh failure interesting let's see let's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m36s)



[see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m46s)



[repositories negative one issues was not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m48s)



[found oh oh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m51s)



[that is because I called get all issues](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m55s)



[and it doesn't use any of my other stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h52m59s)



[well that's not a good thing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h53m07s)

[extract extract method yeah method](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h53m32s)



[please get repo ID](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h53m35s)



[don't know where you just put it oh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h53m44s)

[that means we just do this into here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h53m59s)



[right boom nice and actually I think we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m02s)



[take it as this doesn't quite get us](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m11s)



[around it because we want this actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m14s)



[down here and this down around here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m17s)

[call into here did a long ago ID gets oh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m30s)



[wait](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m43s)



[get repo ID boom boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m44s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m50s)



[what do you fix that in a minute and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m51s)



[then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h54m56s)



[this guy uses the local rather than the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m00s)



[cash great great great great great great](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m03s)



[you see tasks sorry about all this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m06s)



[boilerplate I do apologize I realized](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m09s)



[that's not what we set out to do return](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m14s)



[repo ID](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m19s)



[I'm not entirely sure what this is going](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m34s)



[to do so we're gonna run it hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m37s)



[I think this works now but okay so that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m39s)



[that failed now for a different reason](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m46s)



[but I'm more interested if this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m48s)



[deadlocks when I run it through here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m49s)



[mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m52s)



[okay no it doesn't perfect I couldn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m56s)



[remember how it handled that so in that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h55m59s)



[case I definitely want to do this guy up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m05s)



[here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m09s)



[okay so that fixes that all the way](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m15s)



[through there okay we still have this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m18s)



[issue of a search so let's let's grab](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m19s)



[this our intersection boom and let's get](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m25s)



[a list of these things all right sounds](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m35s)



[good](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m37s)



[and then just verify this thing is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m37s)



[correct so oh I think our assertion was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m43s)



[just backwards right oh this is why you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m51s)



[should write things onto multiple lines](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m54s)



[so that you don't make mistakes like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m55s)



[it's not like anyone's ever screwed up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h56m58s)



[and gotten their assertions backwards](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m00s)



[before never ever so before you fix your](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m02s)



[code you should read your code okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m08s)



[the test runner is thinking very hard](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m17s)



[I'm wondering if I did deadlock it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m21s)



[though](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m24s)



[No](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m37s)



[I think I might have ooh retro yeah well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m40s)



[that's why I was a little surprised that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m44s)



[way desi because normally wait a sink is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m46s)



[gonna get a is gonna empty the semaphore](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m48s)



[right mm-hm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m51s)



[so it's gonna get access to the key and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m52s)



[then it's gonna go into here which is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m54s)



[going to try to get again and then it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m56s)



[gonna lock on itself](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h57m58s)



[cuz the problem is I effectively have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m02s)



[two methods that all want to call the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m04s)



[same thing at the same time and I really](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m06s)



[only want one going at a time and the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m09s)



[problem is when there's nested calls I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m12s)



[think what we do is we just do this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m17s)



[right so we only lock around the client](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m20s)



[I think it would just do this it fixes](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m30s)



[it right yeah and then just boom](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m32s)



[something more like that let's try that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m39s)



[hey that's looking better green lights](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m50s)



[all the way Christ I know you can't see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m52s)



[them but trust me](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m55s)



[I appreciate the announcement so this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h58m56s)



[really doesn't seem that hard](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m02s)



[honestly haha this seems it really](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m03s)



[doesn't it's like when I when we first](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m08s)



[started to go into this like all the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m13s)



[different possibilities like was kind of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m16s)



[overwhelming but as we started just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m18s)



[talking through some of the different](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m20s)



[examples it's like Oh or you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m22s)



[different possibilities it's like oh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m23s)



[this actually like this this is actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m25s)



[kind of straightforward it's just a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m29s)



[slightly different way of thinking about](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m30s)



[it yeah I guess I'm also wondering now](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m32s)



[to where else to apply this this would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m35s)



[be cuz I know we had talked before and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m38s)



[was wanting to do something fancy with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m42s)



[like UI testing mm-hmm for like the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m44s)



[material design demo app here you can't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m47s)



[see my screens that won't help you if I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m51s)



[pull it up but here's what I can do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m52s)



[here's what I can do I have I have the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=00h59m55s)



[power so if I do this right start](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m01s)



[sharing mm-hmm I don't think yeah it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m05s)



[doesn't oh okay so you now see my screen](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m10s)



[yes sweet because I and maybe it might](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m13s)



[be worth talking through some of these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m18s)



[because we could keep going down some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m20s)



[more of these metamorphic relationships](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m21s)



[but I'm it seems like if it's the at](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m24s)



[least the examples that are just set](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m27s)



[theory of and get a set of things do a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m29s)



[set theory operation on another set of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m32s)



[things mm-hmm but your first set was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m34s)



[done so here's my thought right so this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m37s)



[this library's largely just themes now](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m44s)



[there's some custom controls and whatnot](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m47s)



[built into here for example the obvious](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m49s)



[thing is like this hamburger menu in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m52s)



[this flyout right those are those are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m54s)



[not default WPF controls okay so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m56s)



[obviously a couple custom things to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h00m58s)



[support stuff like that but the question](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m00s)



[comes is how do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m02s)



[you go through and like test these so we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m03s)



[started writing unit tests on some of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m06s)



[the logic in the custom controls because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m09s)



[that can be easily unit tested well what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m10s)



[can't be tested is effectively the bulk](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m13s)



[of the library which is all of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m16s)



[styles and looks right but there's been](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m17s)



[enough bugs that I'm almost wondering so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m21s)



[for example we've got all this stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m23s)



[right but you can come in here and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m24s)



[actually one of the guys who might end](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m28s)



[up pairing with me next week](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m29s)



[helped to build out this this beautiful](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m31s)



[thing but even something simple like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m33s)



[this right like how do you know that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m37s)



[this worked right and it seems like and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m39s)



[I'm wondering if you can do this with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m48s)



[images right because capturing these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m51s)



[things as a screenshot is not terribly](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m53s)



[complex mm-hmm and the things without](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m55s)



[and I'm like you might have to put a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h01m59s)



[delay on it because you'll notice like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m01s)



[the click I don't know if you can see it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m02s)



[but there's kind of a little ripple II](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m04s)



[thing that pops up when you click there](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m05s)



[it's almost like I feel like I could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m09s)



[just capture screenshots and then do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m12s)



[some assertions right if I I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m15s)



[almost wondering if you need to go that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m19s)



[far](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m20s)



[and not knowing how this is coded](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m21s)



[underneath the covers I mean outside of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m24s)



[sam'l I'm wondering if you could just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m28s)



[capture the sam'l and compare the light](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m31s)



[versus the dark because I'm I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m34s)



[theoretically the only thing that should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m39s)



[change is like a what a cover property](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m41s)



[or like a hue property or something like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m43s)



[that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m46s)



[well but therein lies the problem is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m46s)



[there is none of these here and actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m48s)



[let's we can switch over here right like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m50s)



[oh wow note to self these buttons are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m53s)



[really hard to see in dark theme and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h02m58s)



[they may not show very much here on any](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m02s)



[of these but most of most of its gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m05s)



[change on them they're all just gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m10s)



[have like the background color on the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m11s)



[patch is just gonna be a dynamic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m13s)



[resource](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m15s)



[okay and so the toggle between light and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m16s)



[dark isn't actually part of the the like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m19s)



[for I think that it was easier to see on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m23s)



[the color tool like this text here right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m25s)



[the color change here where it's going](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m28s)



[from white to dark the this guy actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m31s)



[has no change to his coat himself it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m36s)



[got a dynamic resource at the window](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m39s)



[level and the thing that the dynamic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m41s)



[resource points at is what's getting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m44s)



[swapped okay so I do and that's the part](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m46s)



[where it gets really hard is I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m49s)



[know how to actually verify because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m51s)



[ultimately the bug that I'd love to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m54s)



[catch is finding areas where where](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m56s)



[things didn't toggle correctly right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h03m59s)



[mm-hmm because that's really that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m01s)



[really what we're looking for and we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m04s)



[have this problem actually on a client](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m05s)



[right now](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m07s)



[so they've got we've got an iOS app all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m07s)



[right iOS 13 Apple decides okay we're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m11s)



[gonna go and we are going to bestow dark](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m14s)



[mode upon our users because you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m16s)



[we've we've conceded yes Google's was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m19s)



[right it's a great feature so so they](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m22s)



[add it and by default all iOS apps opt](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m26s)



[into dark mode oh yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m30s)



[by default oh wow you can go through and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m33s)



[opt out but that means you had to go and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m36s)



[make a change right okay you do nothing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m38s)



[you get opted in and it's not as](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m40s)



[horrible as it sounds right cuz if okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m42s)



[if people are using just the standard](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m44s)



[styling and default controls it just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m46s)



[works it falls apart is the moment that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m49s)



[somebody has put in any sort of color](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m52s)



[codes because that should now explicitly](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m53s)



[set something that may or may not jive](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m56s)



[when they start changing out some of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h04m59s)



[other colors right so and that's and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m00s)



[that's the problem that they were in and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m03s)



[so ultimately this sort of testing would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m06s)



[have been really really nice right yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m09s)



[well yeah because I I'm still trying to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m14s)



[think like cuz if I take these two](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m17s)



[images right and I'm just gonna say like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m19s)



[what yeah what what would that look like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m22s)



[I'm like I'm trying to to picture my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m26s)



[brain](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m28s)



[or in my head you know Oh what what that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m29s)



[ends up playing out like yeah that could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m33s)



[a little kind of fun too right real](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m37s)



[quick right you want to see it yeah okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m38s)



[cuz I mean I mean we cuz we could do it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m42s)



[on this page here and see how it works](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m44s)



[so okay so we're gonna skip over the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m46s)



[whole capturing screenshot spit right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m50s)



[and I'm just gonna capture some images](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m52s)



[so got to make sure we're in the same](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m53s)



[state in both of them so and I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m57s)



[get my mouse off and I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h05m59s)



[move that focus rectangle out that'll](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m03s)



[work](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m08s)



[I guess it doesn't matter as long as the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m08s)



[focus rectangle is in the same spot what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m10s)



[does it matter right okay so okay we'll](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m12s)



[have it there so let's see print screen](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m16s)



[there and I'm gonna do I have anything](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m20s)



[other than paint nope](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m24s)



[No note to self need to install](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m25s)



[something other than paint okay so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m28s)



[there's the light screen shot all print](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m30s)



[screen so for anybody who hasn't seen it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m35s)



[before alt printscreen will capture just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m37s)



[the window yes I'm aware that things](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m41s)



[like Windows s are built into Windows 10](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m43s)



[now deal with it okay so okay so we got](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m46s)



[those let's just we'll just do it right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m50s)



[here right because we already got this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m53s)



[stuff going yep okay so step one we need](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m55s)



[a new game package because that's how](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h06m58s)



[all great solutions start so browse and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m02s)



[we'll do open CV sharp for people who](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m06s)



[haven't worked with open CV](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m12s)



[open CV sharp is or I should say open CV](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m13s)



[is sort of the standard by which all](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m17s)



[image processing libraries are measured](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m21s)



[it is they have long since been the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m23s)



[leaders of everything they get low](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m26s)



[points for being usable and simple but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m29s)



[there is so they there's a wealth of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m31s)



[information out there on it and so CV](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m34s)



[sharp is just an auto-generated c-sharp](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m36s)



[wrapper](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m39s)



[okay test method public I think just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m40s)



[Boyd I don't think we need to do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m46s)



[anything a stinky foo it sounds great](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m47s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m53s)



[okay so step one we should save these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m54s)



[images somewhere right no we're just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h07m57s)



[gonna save these guys out and it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m00s)



[important that we save them in a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m01s)



[reasonable format and I think we'll just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m03s)



[go with 24-bit bitmap let's see github](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m05s)



[helper we should name them something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m09s)



[that will make sense so how about light](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m13s)



[great go away give me the other one](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m17s)



[and we'll save you as again 24-bit](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m21s)



[bitmap because I don't want to deal with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m27s)



[like weird color conversion stuff yes we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m29s)



[could but that's a lot more code and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m33s)



[don't want to think so far light image](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m34s)



[gets new is it new mat or is there a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m38s)



[static on it uh no it's CV - I am read](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m42s)



[there we are oh nice so again low points](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h08m55s)



[for for being able to do that because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m00s)



[you just kind of had to have divined](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m02s)



[that information or looked up a tutorial](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m04s)



[so we're gonna just again in the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m07s)



[interest of doing this let's see we're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m11s)



[going to load up light bitmap](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m14s)



[boom we'll do dark dot bitmap and then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m20s)



[we want to let's see what do we want to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m32s)



[do we want to effectively dip them](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m34s)



[mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m36s)



[so I think let's see what is that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m37s)



[calculates the per element absolutely](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m44s)



[difference between the two array](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m46s)



[elements perfect something like that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m47s)



[yeah and yes I am very aware that I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m49s)



[should be disposing of all of these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m53s)



[objects so these are all every OpenCV](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m55s)



[object is a c-sharp wrapper over an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h09m58s)



[unmanaged thing so you really should be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m00s)



[doing something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m02s)



[mmm we have C sharp eight we won't be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m02s)



[bad so using matte diff image gets new](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m06s)



[matte all right boom done and unlike](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m12s)



[normal same things once you start](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m17s)



[dealing with unmanaged stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m18s)



[little things like instantiating to the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m22s)



[right values just don't matter as much](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m24s)



[anymore let's see see v2](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m26s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m30s)



[that is not what I wanted I was very](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m40s)



[confused there for a second](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m44s)



[okay so run as you can see this is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m45s)



[horribly complex and also blows up in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m53s)



[your face let's see what are you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m56s)



[complaining about now dll not found huh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h10m58s)

[you were missing huh let me just check](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m18s)



[to make sure I'm not doing something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m24s)



[stupid](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m25s)



[oh you you think this line right here is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m28s)



[the key right reading Oh P oops sighs](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m37s)



[sighs I see what is the difference](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m48s)



[between here and here all in one pack](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h17m55s)



[ones usually it has the two dependents](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m01s)



[oh so what you're saying is I should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m04s)



[have just installed this and not been a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m06s)



[moron that's I mean that's super obvious](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m08s)



[well lesson learned this is probably why](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m15s)



[they had a major version Rev because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m18s)



[they restructured how their packages](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m22s)



[were done and figured they were gonna do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m24s)



[it in a nice sane way and yeah that only](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m25s)



[works when people read the directions](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m30s)



[which clearly I am too stupid to do so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m33s)



[we're gonna take this guy out and just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m37s)



[let the other one have preference okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m39s)



[so there's that there's that we're gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m43s)



[try again](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m46s)



[I suspect we could go back to dotnet](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m47s)



[core now - oh look we loaded an image](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m49s)



[hey show me the image okay well you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h18m54s)



[didn't want to show me the image well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m00s)



[that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m02s)



[that's fine blah blah blah size width Oh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m04s)



[so the output image didn't have the same](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m12s)



[size that's let's just check that real](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m14s)



[quick cuz that yeah that would be a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m21s)



[simple fix diff image yeah you have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m25s)



[nothing so let's just make sure this guy](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m29s)



[loaded up oh that's probably the problem](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m33s)



[the loaded image is our 0 by 0 according](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m36s)



[to this that doesn't seem right let's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m42s)



[just confirm will it do that if the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m49s)



[images in the spot was expecting well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m53s)



[it'll do that if the images are 0](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m56s)



[kilobytes ah so what the heck paint so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h19m58s)



[we're gonna go ahead and kill execution](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m09s)



[here so I suspect that if I were to say](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m10s)



[double-click on this image probably](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m14s)



[wouldn't know much it you know wait what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m17s)



[hey I wonder if this thing's holding on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m21s)



[to a file handle Oh Oh paint](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m33s)



[oh okay so hypothetically I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m41s)



[watch one more time and just make sure](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m46s)



[that the light one shows that but I mean](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m47s)



[like I'm not the only one confused by](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m50s)



[what just happened right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m53s)



[you are not watched i watch you take the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m54s)



[screenshots right okay so the light](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h20m56s)



[image now loads the dark image what the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m00s)



[heck](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m05s)



[okay let's try this one more time](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m05s)



[conveniently still open all print screen](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m08s)



[I am losing this is why I need to go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m13s)



[install something else this is why this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m15s)



[is why paint not the best tool for the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m18s)



[job dark we're gonna overwrite that say](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m21s)



[yeah very confident we're gonna close](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m29s)



[uh-huh we're gonna we're gonna check](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m33s)



[here right that looks like a file whoa](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m36s)



[that was your problem obviously you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m41s)



[didn't test that the file saved](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m43s)



[correctly I clearly okay so light image](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m45s)



[all right dark image sighs TIFF image](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m51s)



[curved arrow which is fine but you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m54s)



[step over TIFF image has stuff actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h21m57s)



[that's gonna be a problem so here's what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m08s)



[we're gonna do the the thing is gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m11s)



[hang if we try to use the Shem home](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m14s)



[so we'll just I am right and we'll just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m17s)



[do something like diff and I think it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m22s)



[path and then matrix that's what Matt](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m28s)



[stands for by the way is matrix because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m33s)



[all images are inherently just mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m35s)



[return 0 no point in thinking ok so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m39s)



[we'll just run real quick it goes and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m44s)



[does its thing everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m47s)



[great we'll go and check our output](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m49s)



[we've got an image okay so here's what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m54s)



[you end up getting right huh when you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m57s)



[dip it yeah so and this is where I feel](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h22m59s)



[like I could get some useful information](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m04s)



[out of this right like so there's a few](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m06s)



[things that are that are really obvious](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m10s)



[to me right out the gate that may not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m11s)



[have been obvious from looking at the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m13s)



[other one right so it makes where so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m14s)



[things were true type I don't know if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m17s)



[you're familiar with that term](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m20s)



[we're windows renders your fonts with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m21s)



[sub-pixel rendering where it will put](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m24s)



[like the little red and blue to make](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m26s)



[your fonts more readable oh gosh shows](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m29s)



[up really like shows up a lot because it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m31s)



[gets really obvious to see it right here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m34s)



[right who's that makes that makes sense](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m37s)



[we have up here obviously no to type](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m40s)



[this is just straight up right which](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m46s)



[okay we could we could dive into why](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m50s)



[that's the case and you can kind of see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m52s)



[it more on some of the other on the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m53s)



[other text right so it's really none of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m55s)



[these texts have that problem it's just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m57s)



[up here looks like this guy probably](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h23m59s)



[rendered with TrueType given that I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m03s)



[seeing some color colorization there](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m05s)



[because ultimately all we've done is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m07s)



[diff all of the individual elements so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m09s)



[it takes the the red Channel you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m11s)



[dips it with the opposing pixels red](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m14s)



[Channel and then writes that in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m16s)



[mm-hmm so then you end up with something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m18s)



[that kind of comes out looking like this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m21s)



[and so if we go back to what this looks](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m24s)



[like it's interesting to me that this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m26s)



[slider came out black right that one](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m29s)



[surprises me I almost wonder if we do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m34s)



[like a grayscale comparison between the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m39s)



[two like flatten them down hmm that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m41s)



[might be an interesting check and this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m48s)



[starts and this is where I keep feeling](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m49s)



[like I could do some reasonable testing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m51s)



[right like because fundamentally under](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m55s)



[the hood it feels like metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h24m59s)



[testing and some amount of like image](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m00s)



[manipulation very well into each other](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m08s)



[right because we're working with sets of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m11s)



[data images are just other sets of data](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m13s)



[mm-hmm and that feels like it could be a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m17s)



[really powerful thing yeah I mean we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m23s)



[we've had we say we actually had a case](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m27s)



[that we potentially could have used that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m30s)



[at one of our clients they've got a GIS](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m33s)



[application and part of this application](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m38s)



[you know so is a map and the company](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m40s)



[that makes it there's no accessibility](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m45s)



[information which is how a lot of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m48s)



[desktop testing tools work and so we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m50s)



[briefly explored like placing an object](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m53s)



[on the map and then taking the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h25m58s)



[screenshot we didn't we didn't go this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m00s)



[route of make sure that the new](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m04s)



[screenshot and the old screenshot there](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m06s)



[the original you know the only be a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m09s)



[superset because it'd be the same image](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m12s)



[with this new feature or this new object](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m14s)



[they added on it we tried to go the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m16s)



[route of take a screenshot at some point](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m18s)



[that looks like what we think it's gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m20s)



[look like when the test runs and it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m23s)



[never really worked out this would could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m25s)



[have been a very interesting way](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m29s)



[to handle that all right because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m32s)



[everything would have been the same](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m34s)



[except for this new thing that we put on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m36s)



[the map yep yep and a lot of this stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m40s)



[it dives down into like most like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m45s)



[detection type stuff work by getting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m50s)



[down to a binary image at some level and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m53s)



[I'm wondering if some of the confusion](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m55s)



[here is because this isn't a binary](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m57s)



[image one second let's let's try that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h26m58s)



[real quick if you don't mind huh sure](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m00s)



[because now I know now I'm really](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m02s)



[curious let's see I think I can just do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m04s)



[light image what was it CV something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m09s)



[another CBT color great color conversion](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m14s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m17s)



[BG r2 gray so it is worth noting nice](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m20s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m24s)



[that on open CV when it loads up images](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m25s)



[by default the RGB channels are actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m29s)



[internally stored BGR hmm so just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m33s)



[something to be aware of if you go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m40s)



[through because once you start dealing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m43s)



[with channel stuff that actually you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m44s)



[know matters so nope one more line down](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m46s)



[okay so we're gonna do dark gray and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m52s)



[we'll do the dark color conversion and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h27m58s)



[then we'll do light gray dark gray](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m03s)



[I'm just really curious here because I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m14s)



[think there was a couple if options it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m16s)



[interesting that I I might have to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m26s)



[I might have to poke around that API a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m31s)



[little bit I think there's I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m32s)



[there's other options available as well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m33s)



[yeah so just run that blah blah blah go](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m35s)



[back here reopened if basically the same](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m40s)



[information except where we've thrown](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m45s)



[away the it still does interest me that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m49s)



[that this thing here mm-hmm and maybe](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h28m56s)



[that makes sense](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m00s)



[can we go back to the page oh no it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m03s)



[doesn't make sense it makes perfect](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m06s)



[sense](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m08s)



[everywhere where there's black mm-hmm is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m08s)



[okay so the same because black is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m11s)



[inherently zero right uh-huh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m14s)



[and white is all bits on 255 uh-huh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m17s)



[and so everywhere where you see white is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m22s)



[something that has changed and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m25s)



[everywhere where you see black has](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m26s)



[imaged yeah okay so that okay so that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m29s)



[that basically makes fairly good sense](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m32s)



[mm-hmm and I mean you can go through and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m35s)



[figure out like you can do so what you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m37s)



[can do is you can use these things as](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m42s)



[like template masts mmm-hmm and use them](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m43s)



[to effectively cut portions of your](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m47s)



[image out and figure out what changed](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m48s)



[and what didn't it does pose an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m50s)



[interesting question though of how do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m53s)



[you know you'd almost have to have a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m55s)



[page with just the element you were](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m58s)



[interested in testing right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h29m59s)



[interesting thoughts interesting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m06s)



[thoughts interesting thoughts](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m09s)



[yeah because that is that is interesting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m16s)



[that that goes through like that oh and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m18s)



[that that's actually really funny I just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m23s)



[noticed that so you've got this lighter](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m25s)



[gray circle here because because this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m27s)



[thing moved](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m30s)



[nice because on the dark side it would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m31s)



[it would have been on website and a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m34s)



[light it's on the other yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m36s)



[interesting interesting interest rates](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m39s)



[so I think if there's a way that you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m41s)



[could do this for a whole page because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m45s)



[you know looking at it I could I could I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m47s)



[can envision a test where let's take](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m51s)



[that that MD palette in the middle for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m54s)



[example where we take you know week if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h30m57s)



[we should be able to grab just a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m02s)



[screenshot of that Clifton white or well](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m05s)



[take the screenshot on light or dark](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m09s)



[flip through everyone take the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m11s)



[screenshot do the diff and make sure](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m12s)



[that it's it's this it's black it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m14s)



[there's there's no difference but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m16s)



[looking at like the cover hex value](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m20s)



[little box up there I could see okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m23s)



[that did change a little bit so you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m27s)



[we could we could do some some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m30s)



[assertions around that but doing it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m32s)



[element by element seems super duper](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m36s)



[tedious yeah so just I'm trying to think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m42s)



[of if there's a way we could do it for a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m47s)



[whole page and I think I don't know if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m49s)



[it's more compelling or not but the the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m55s)



[second aspect is do it in a way where](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m57s)



[you don't have to manually build or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h31m59s)



[specify the relationship for each new](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m03s)



[page is there's I don't know if there's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m05s)



[some characteristic we could look for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m09s)



[that just as hey go to a page take the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m11s)



[screenshot flip it take care of a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m13s)



[screenshot and compare at least I mean](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m14s)



[in this case right because once you get](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m17s)



[that that difference I think you do](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m20s)



[raise the exact](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m24s)



[the correct question of what what would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m25s)



[that relationship be yeah and I can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m29s)



[think that I can pick it out for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m33s)



[specific elements but that's gonna](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m35s)



[differ per page right you know I'll have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m39s)



[to I would have to specify which](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m43s)



[elements are on the page](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m45s)



[I guess that's that's probably the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m47s)



[better way to word it is I I know what](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m48s)



[it is per element so for any page I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m52s)



[don't have to specify the elements that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m54s)



[are on the page to get it to work that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m55s)



[way right and that and on and it doesn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h32m58s)



[even necessarily need to be this app per](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m02s)



[se to test because this writing's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m04s)



[purpose is to just demo everything um](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m06s)



[the other ones that get more interesting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m09s)



[where I see this falling apart is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m12s)



[something like these guys here right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m13s)



[mm-hmm where you've got animation mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m16s)



[and that's why and maybe in that case](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m22s)



[the screenshots not the right not the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m24s)



[right solution right yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m29s)



[hmm yeah because it is a weird case](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m40s)



[where I do want so here's a thought](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m43s)



[since since we know how each element](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m48s)



[should act and you know just like just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m52s)



[looking at the diff I could draw some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m57s)



[conclusions you know you haven't written](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h33m59s)



[written a lot of this would probably be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m02s)



[able to identify them quickly would it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m06s)



[be something that we would specify again](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m09s)



[each element you know hey and white it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m14s)



[should her in white versus dark there](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m16s)



[should be no difference or there should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m20s)



[be a little bit of difference or the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m22s)



[exact opposite difference mm-hmm I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m24s)



[wonder if you could just write a test](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m27s)



[that goes to a page and then you don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m32s)



[specify you just say give me all the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m36s)



[elements on the page and for each one of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m38s)



[those depending on what it's type is or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m40s)



[you know it's well we had type for lack](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m44s)



[of a better word here whatever its type](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m46s)



[is go do the relevant comparison that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m49s)



[way because then it wouldn't matter the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m53s)



[app it wouldn't matter I mean the app](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m56s)



[would wouldn't matter but I mean](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h34m59s)



[fundamentally the actual comparisons it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m01s)



[wouldn't matter right you can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m03s)



[effectively just iterate through all of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m05s)



[them uh-huh for that matter I could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m07s)



[actually so because so we actually so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m10s)



[did it just pull this over here real](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m14s)



[quick because we actually do have a list](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m18s)



[of them okay](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m20s)



[right so if I jump here I've got a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m22s)



[DevOps pipeline mm-hmm that on every](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m26s)



[commit goes through and updates this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m30s)



[wiki there's the lid ice like I've got](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m31s)



[I've got a list of quite literally every](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m37s)



[control and every style for every](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m39s)



[control huh](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m41s)



[and so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m43s)



[yeah so it wouldn't it wouldn't be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m47s)



[trivial but if we could say hey material](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m51s)



[design raise button yeah is that the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h35m57s)



[style is not gonna change looking light](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m01s)



[and dark okay we know in that diff it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m03s)



[gonna come back as black or zero or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m06s)



[however cb2 represents you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m08s)



[represents that programmatically yeah so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m10s)



[then if we grabbed one of those whatever](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m13s)



[the whatever the type and property is in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m15s)



[zamel I'm so just to set expectations](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m18s)



[I'm thinking about this in terms of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m23s)



[using something like Windows application](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m25s)



[driver it's just it's a it's a Microsoft](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m26s)



[tool for doing desktop testing it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m29s)



[replacing or has already replaced](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m32s)



[actually coded UI it differs from coded](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m35s)



[UI and like test a quite and some of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m41s)



[other tools out there the it converts](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m43s)



[your app into XML and then shops it off](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m46s)



[to a p.m. and selenium so you can do so](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m50s)



[if you're familiar with web-based](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m55s)



[testing you can be kind of familiar with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m56s)



[this so so anyway just to level set that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h36m57s)



[if I look for that button all I would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m01s)



[have to say is okay hey this is a button](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m04s)



[Tay or tag name and then Scott maybe I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m06s)



[don't know property that says raised or](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m10s)



[however it looks when wooden have Drive](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m12s)



[or converts it so and then at that point](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m14s)



[that should work I just will just have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m17s)



[to take that list program in the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m22s)



[different properties to look for yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m25s)



[and then and then when when app driver](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m29s)



[goes to a page of your app or a window](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m33s)



[of your app it's gonna serve up this XML](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m37s)



[that's like you know button with](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m40s)



[property whatever or I don't know how](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m42s)



[like your scroll bars are are but one of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m46s)



[the applications that we've tested for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m48s)



[client the scroll bars are divs that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m49s)



[how it's converted so you know the div](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m52s)



[with property I think it's like is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m54s)



[scrollbar equals true that's how I know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m56s)



[it's a scrollbar](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h37m59s)



[so that interest theoretically could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m00s)



[work yeah that is really interesting](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m03s)



[I'm almost actually picturing rather](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m07s)



[than using this app I almost wanted to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m09s)



[have some sort of input file that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m13s)



[contains say the the control style that](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m15s)



[we want to test right mm-hmm and and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m19s)



[maybe underneath it some sort of like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m21s)



[precondition set up for the window like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m24s)



[maybe window size right and then](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m26s)



[underneath that a list of metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m28s)



[relationships like for example doesn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m31s)



[change with darker light Z right mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m34s)



[which I think would be it like an equals](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m38s)



[or an equivalent to go back to the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m42s)



[terminology from that paper right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m44s)



[exactly and I'm because I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m46s)



[envisioning what we could do then is we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m49s)



[could we wouldn't actually need to know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m53s)



[anything about like from that input file](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m55s)



[we could have an app that just ingest](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h38m59s)



[right it makes it would have a window it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m01s)



[would set it to the appropriate size you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m04s)



[want to put the element on the screen it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m06s)



[would screenshot it and or I should say](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m09s)



[it would walk through each of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m11s)



[metamorphic relationships and do the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m12s)



[screenshots that it needs right so it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m15s)



[could go through and it could it can](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m18s)



[even screenshot the window before](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m20s)



[putting the control on there just to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m21s)



[have the effectively the baseline right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m23s)



[mm-hmm and then drop it in and and pull](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m25s)



[it out mm-hmm I think we should try and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m28s)



[build that I mean not necessarily](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m32s)



[tonight but well right in theory I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m33s)



[stream here by 11:00 and I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m36s)



[know if we could build that out tonight](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m39s)



[at that I think like if you're up for it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m41s)



[I would love to go through and and maybe](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m44s)



[one night just walk through the basics](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m47s)



[of setting up the UI tests and again](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m51s)



[whether we pointed at this app or some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m53s)



[other app I'm not real picky but I'd](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m55s)



[love to get basic UI test set up and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h39m57s)



[have the framework there I know we could](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m01s)



[that we could start plugging into yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m03s)



[totally suite because I think that would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m05s)



[be really fun it would be very](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m09s)



[interesting to try because I think right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m10s)



[I think that could work](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m12s)



[really well now obviously I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m14s)



[there's some things that I just have to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m15s)



[exclude from that right like like one of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m17s)



[these guys here though at the same time](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m21s)



[I don't know if I need to completely](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m23s)



[exclude them because I'm envisioning a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m25s)



[couple fancy tricks like if we](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m31s)



[screenshot before we put the control on](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m33s)



[the page then we add the control and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m35s)



[screenshot again the diff between those](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m37s)



[two gives us the control specifically](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m40s)



[where it's located on the image in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m43s)



[pixels right yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m44s)



[and that and that gives us a lot some](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m46s)



[controls don't lend themselves well like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m50s)



[these fly outs so for example the door](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m51s)



[control right because these things are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m57s)



[all about opening and closing right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h40m59s)



[there would have to I don't think this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m03s)



[control specifically would lend itself](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m06s)



[well to this form of testing right yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m08s)



[I mean we could maybe do like the drawer](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m11s)



[itself with the content in it would I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m14s)



[think would get tough right and that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m16s)



[where and that's where almost I I don't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m19s)



[know if the payout is worth it to go to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m22s)



[test it or like for example these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m24s)



[dialogues where where they can pop up](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m26s)



[and do that now there may be something](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m28s)



[we can do with these dialogues like for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m31s)



[example I would love to assert that you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m33s)



[know the the gray background gets moved](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m35s)



[in and there's a minute I think there's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m38s)



[alternate UI tests that would lend](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m39s)



[themselves well like for example whether](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m42s)



[light dismiss is enabled or not right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m44s)



[and then clicking off should should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m47s)



[close and I don't know if any of these](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m49s)



[things actually have like dismiss turned](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m51s)



[on it doesn't look like it and that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m53s)



[the other thing as the these controls](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m57s)



[themselves there's hierarchies stuff](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h41m59s)



[that goes along with each of these but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m03s)



[that things like that I think would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m04s)



[probably be better to just straight UI](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m07s)



[test versus metamorphose mm-hmm and I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m09s)



[think that's the one thing that I'm not](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m12s)



[sure if I have a clear picture of yet is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m13s)



[wend when do I do which right right and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m16s)



[that I mean](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m21s)



[yeah I mean I yeah I I can think I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m24s)



[there's been definite examples that I've](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m29s)



[encountered after reading those articles](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m32s)



[where I was like yes this this would](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m35s)



[lend itself well but then you're there's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m37s)



[other examples I run into where it's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m43s)



[like well what if though so I you know](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m44s)



[in one particular case we've got a](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m47s)



[client that has a I don't want to say](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m51s)



[large customer information system but I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m54s)



[mean it's it's fairly sizable I want to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h42m58s)



[say they've got six hundred thousand](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m00s)



[customers or something to that effect in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m03s)



[six figures yeah and you know there was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m06s)



[a situation where there was I think](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m11s)



[there was a failure in Prada actually](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m16s)



[and they couldn't figure out out why and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m18s)



[I after reading these articles had this](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m22s)



[thought I was like well I was like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m27s)



[theoretically I'm not saying we should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m28s)



[iterate through every six hundred](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m30s)



[thousand whatever customers but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m31s)



[theoretically we could grab a large](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m33s)



[subset of these these customers in again](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m34s)



[same customer that's got you know query](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m39s)



[we can query for these customers and as](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m41s)



[long as we aren't terrible in our](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m44s)



[queries we're not gonna wreck the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m47s)



[database you know and in this case and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m48s)



[this is where it's it's kind of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m54s)



[borderline maybe just property testing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m56s)



[but it's like what if I take one of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h43m58s)



[these things that I know when I shove it](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m00s)



[into this web service I'm gonna get back](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m03s)



[a ballad call now every single customer](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m05s)



[isn't gonna have the same response from](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m10s)



[this web service because there's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m12s)



[customer keys and and a couple of other](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m13s)



[things that that are gonna vary per](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m17s)



[customer right and they but there's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m19s)



[parts of this response that should](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m22s)



[always be the same and so that it's like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m24s)



[that right there I could potentially](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m27s)



[leverage something like this where I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m29s)



[make the call with like you know a known](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m31s)



[customer not in Prague just](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m35s)



[the record you know make a call to known](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m37s)



[customer get the response back that I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m40s)



[know maybe these properties should be](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m42s)



[the same but then go back and iterate](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m43s)



[through I don't know a hundred thousand](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m46s)



[accounts and look for this failure and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m48s)



[they saw but even that actually as I was](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m51s)



[talking about it's like I know what the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m54s)



[response is so that probably wouldn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m55s)



[classify so yeah so it's like well but I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h44m57s)



[don't know like so I guess the question](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m02s)



[is I think it sort of depends on how you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m04s)



[write that test right because if the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m06s)



[thing that you're looking for in the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m08s)



[response is something that you hard code](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m10s)



[then yeah that's that's more of an](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m11s)



[Oracle based test but if the thing in](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m13s)



[the response is something like if you're](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m15s)



[basing it against me some known customer](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m18s)



[response like you know I want to check](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m21s)



[the metadata element for example right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m25s)



[and you know I I want the the assertion](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m27s)



[that I want to make is that all metadata](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m31s)



[elements should have the same keys mhm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m33s)



[right yeah and I don't know what those](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m36s)



[keys are normally they'll match right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m39s)



[yeah and that's and that's that's kind](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m45s)



[of the struggle I was having with that's](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m49s)



[with that particular case you know of](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m50s)



[like Oh would it be considered](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m55s)



[metamorphic testing whether or not but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m56s)



[the idea behind it I think was totally](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h45m58s)



[valid but yeah then you know wait like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m01s)



[you said you know we've got other cases](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m05s)



[where it's like now this an Oracle here](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m07s)



[would be fine right I think that is and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m09s)



[I think that's the one thing that is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m14s)



[sticking out to me is with metamorphic](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m16s)



[testing it's more about making sure you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m18s)



[understand first what you're testing for](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m21s)



[right because that that's almost the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m24s)



[most important question of what in my](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m26s)



[what am I trying to test for what is](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m28s)



[what is that relationship and if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m30s)



[relationship on the the because you come](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m34s)



[up with a relationship equation mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m37s)



[and if you've got a constant on one side](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m39s)



[and you basically have an Oracle test](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m42s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m44s)



[yeah but metamorphic lets you have](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m46s)



[effectively variables on both sides and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m50s)



[you just assert that you know given](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m56s)



[operator X yeah this equation it returns](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h46m58s)



[true mm-hmm I think I like it yeah I did](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m02s)



[do it makes it very interesting yeah I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m09s)



[do think that it would be fun to get to](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m14s)



[get in and set up a a UI framework or at](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m16s)



[least see is see what the effort is and](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m21s)



[and I may even take a crack at scene](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m24s)



[about you know building a simple WPF app](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m26s)



[where I can feed it in some data because](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m30s)



[I don't even need like I don't even need](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m33s)



[to live inside of the library right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m35s)



[right like at that point it has nothing](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m37s)



[to do really with the internals of the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m41s)



[library I can test this completely](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m44s)



[outside yep yeah better actually yeah](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m45s)



[and I mean as long as someone doesn't](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m50s)



[try and customize it you begin to go die](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m52s)



[I mean as far as like in their app right](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m56s)



[as long as they're just using the](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h47m59s)



[out-of-the-box you know library](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m01s)



[functionality shouldn't matter where you](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m03s)



[test it I think I want to try it now](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m06s)



[darn it why is it all all the best ideas](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m10s)



[happen right around this time of day I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m12s)



[think I read somewhere that people are](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m15s)



[more creative when they're like](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m17s)

[more creative I would be surprised if](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m26s)



[the ideas were any good you shame](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m28s)



[because the the quality of my ideas or I](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m31s)



[should say the quantity of my ideas](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m34s)



[definitely goes up the later it gets but](https://youtu.be/ieAWbxQQRx4?t=01h48m35s)
