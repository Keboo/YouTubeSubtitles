[so let's get rid of that I mean this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h00m13s)

[what I wanted to show but not like this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h00m16s)

[uh I want that on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h00m19s)

[there's a big feedback button up in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m37s)

[corner that'll take you to a GitHub repo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m39s)

[to log an issue](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m41s)

[feel free to log away](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m42s)

[um the content in here is very similar](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m45s)

[to The Print content though it's been](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m48s)

[updated for a lot of the c-sharp 11](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m50s)

[stuff now I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m51s)

[I need to go back and double check I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m53s)

[think we got through all of the C sharp](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m55s)

[11 content](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m57s)

[there's a question of will it all be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h01m59s)

[there like if you go through the release](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m02s)

[notes of what's new in c-sharp 11 you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m03s)

[gonna find things in there that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m06s)

[we just aren't likely to cover here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m09s)

[because the idea here is this is the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m11s)

[essential parts of C sharp of what does](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m14s)

[somebody actually need to know to go](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m16s)

[from beginner to Advanced right think of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m17s)

[it you know entry level person senior C](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m21s)

[sharp developer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m24s)

[ish at least in terms of the language](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m25s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m29s)

[that's what's covered here and there's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m29s)

[going to be a lot of stuff that just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m31s)

[doesn't get covered because subjectively](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m33s)

[not essential](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m36s)

[for what it's worth but feel free to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m38s)

[throw feedback at us if there's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m40s)

[something that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m42s)

[seems to be non-essential or something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m44s)

[that you think that there should be if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m46s)

[you find bugs and whatnot let us know we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m48s)

[have put in way too many hours of work](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m51s)

[making this thing the amount of code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m54s)

[behind generating the site is a lot more](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h02m57s)

[than what I will get into but it is it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m00s)

[is pretty cool and there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m03s)

[features that we have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m06s)

[still in the works of what we would like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m07s)

[to see coming interactive code listings](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m09s)

[uh client-side compiler you can think of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m11s)

[this like what you see in the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m14s)

[docs where they're able to let you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m16s)

[interact with the code samples and just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m18s)

[run it right there uh full text search](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m19s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m23s)

[records this one I think is a lie](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m25s)

[yeah this one's a lie Benjamin why is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m33s)

[that still here I thought I nuked it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m36s)

[apparently my PR hasn't merged I should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m38s)

[go check my PR](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m42s)

[but there are there are content updates](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m42s)

[and things uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m46s)

[uh coming as you go and then what makes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m48s)

[it really exciting for me is that you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m51s)

[can just you know hyperlink in at any of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m52s)

[these headings so that you know when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m55s)

[people ask questions I can now link them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m57s)

[to something because the Microsoft docs](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h03m59s)

[are good but the Microsoft docs often](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m01s)

[tell you the what of the language not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m04s)

[the why or the how](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m06s)

[which is always bothering to me and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m08s)

[frustrating and yucky and makes me feel](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m11s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m18s)

[yeah so at some point](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m19s)

[I will go and fix my make sure my PR](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m22s)

[goes through so that um that ends up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m25s)

[dying the the website for this if you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m28s)

[hit the feedback link](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m31s)

[um the website portion is actually open](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m33s)

[source so if you find a bug that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m37s)

[related to the website itself](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m39s)

[that's here now I will warn you the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m41s)

[website when I say the website project](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m44s)

[here this does not contain any of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m46s)

[book contents inside of this repo so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m49s)

[this is the we'll call it the shell of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m52s)

[the website and then we've got stuff](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m54s)

[that data drives and brings it all in so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m56s)

[if you if you run into something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h04m58s)

[yeah Benjamin comments that it's open](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m02s)

[source and anyone can go and change that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m04s)

[page and I thought I had](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m06s)

[apparently not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m11s)

[apparently not I must have only talked](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m13s)

[about doing a PR not actually doing it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m15s)

[if I get motivated I'm going to circle](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m17s)

[back and go and fix that because this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m19s)

[not content coming soon this is content](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m21s)

[implemented](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m22s)

[um I think file scope namespaces are not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m24s)

[done yet though](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m26s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m30s)

[yeah file scope namespaces are not done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m34s)

[yet so those will be those will be bits](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m37s)

[of content and things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m40s)

[um coming along as as we get more and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m42s)

[more added into it so again feedback](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m46s)

[very welcome](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m48s)

[the we know there things are far from](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m50s)

[perfect every time you go through it you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m52s)

[find a few more things to go and change](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m55s)

[every time I go and look at it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m57s)

[I find little things that are just a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h05m59s)

[little bit off and then I have to go and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m00s)

[fix them so again feedback very much](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m01s)

[welcome](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m04s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m06s)

[Benjamin did you literally just open a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m08s)

[PR](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m10s)

[hey my PR did merge](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m13s)

[so why did we ship this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m19s)

[see I deleted them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m25s)

[why do I still see the content](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m28s)

[this isn't something that got mixed up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m31s)

[in a uh somebody's Force pushing over](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m34s)

[Maine](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m36s)

[intent nudge nudge](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m40s)

[but regardless we'll get it merged okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m45s)

[next announcement and I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m48s)

[know why that's there give her that okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m51s)

[so uh earlier this week](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m52s)

[and YouTube is all kinds of confused](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h06m57s)

[um me and a colleague of mine artem we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m02s)

[did a lunch and learn and the the title](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m05s)

[of it was test it right sleep well at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m08s)

[night a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m11s)

[a title that chat GPT may have had a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m12s)

[small hand in helping me come up with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m15s)

[um but the idea was we were wanting to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m18s)

[look into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m21s)

[that's why I think I can phrase the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m23s)

[philosophy behind testing because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m25s)

[teaching somebody the how and the what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m26s)

[of writing tests in my opinion is kind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m29s)

[of easy I can do that that's a technical](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m32s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m34s)

[um the harder part is getting people in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m36s)

[the right mindset to do testing that's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m38s)

[people problem and I struggle with that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m40s)

[a lot more because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m42s)

[computers and code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m44s)

[are things that I can control people are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m46s)

[not so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m49s)

[we we tried to go through](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m52s)

[um and have a fairly good discussion on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m55s)

[tdd and I'm going to summarize because I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h07m57s)

[don't have an hour to to rehash the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m01s)

[whole thing but at no better better I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m03s)

[don't need to do this I I can do better](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m06s)

[than this stand by](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m07s)

[because when you give a talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m09s)

[you have the slide deck](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m12s)

[booyah turns out I got my own slide deck](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m17s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m21s)

[I'm gonna just bust through the same](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m23s)

[slides that we're in here uh real quick](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m25s)

[just to give just to give a quick catch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m27s)

[up so the the thing with tdd is most](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m28s)

[people get really focused on tdd being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m32s)

[tied to like unit testing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m35s)

[drop that out of your brain for a moment](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m39s)

[just ignore it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m40s)

[um the the important letter in tdd isn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m42s)

[the test portion of it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m46s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m48s)

[um uh it's it's going for the D either](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m50s)

[tester and development or test driven](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m52s)

[design is almost another way of saying](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m54s)

[it going with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m56s)

[um what is actually important so the I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h08m58s)

[idea and again coming down to the very](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m01s)

[bottom a tool for designing your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m03s)

[so if you switch out of the idea that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m06s)

[you're doing tests or you're doing tdd](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m08s)

[for the idea of oh well I have to write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m10s)

[my tests first because that's what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m12s)

[people tell me I'm supposed to do I have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m14s)

[to get all of this going no no throw](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m16s)

[that out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m18s)

[if you approach it from the idea that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m20s)

[tdd is about getting the design of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m22s)

[code correct it helps you think through](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m25s)

[the problem and think about what it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m27s)

[you're actually trying to do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m29s)

[I had posted out on Twitter before we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m31s)

[did this talk asking people about you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m34s)

[know what stops you from writing tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m36s)

[early](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m38s)

[um and uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m40s)

[another MVP commented on there that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m43s)

[and because I'm trying to remember how I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m47s)

[phrased the question something along](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m50s)

[what stops you from writing tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m51s)

[earlier or what would get you to write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m52s)

[tests earlier or or what it was and his](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m54s)

[comment was as soon as he knows the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m57s)

[shape of the code he starts writing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h09m58s)

[tests effectively once he gets far](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m00s)

[enough in to understand the problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m02s)

[right is kind of what you can see](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m05s)

[because oftentimes people hear the idea](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m07s)

[of well you have to write your test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m08s)

[first and they get all hung up on this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m09s)

[how can I write tests I don't even know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m11s)

[what the code's supposed to look like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m13s)

[yet](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m14s)

[okay get yourself to the point where you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m15s)

[understand what it is you're trying to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m18s)

[solve because if you're able to start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m20s)

[writing code you must know something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m22s)

[about what you're trying to accomplish](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m24s)

[otherwise you're just spewing things at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m25s)

[the compiler](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m28s)

[but once you have an idea of what it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m29s)

[supposed to be doing or what the uh what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m32s)

[the shape of that solution is going to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m35s)

[look like you can start doing it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m36s)

[one of the other big big things I would](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m38s)

[call out to people is this bottom](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m41s)

[question is what is the source of Truth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m43s)

[The implementation that you write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m44s)

[or the test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m48s)

[because there was a story I was told of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m50s)

[a team where they did a lot of pair](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m53s)

[programming they were very very into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h10m56s)

[test driven development and uh two](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m00s)

[members of that team sat down to work on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m03s)

[on a bit of code one of them was a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m05s)

[little bit newer to the team](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m06s)

[and the the senior the person who'd been](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m08s)

[on the team a bit longer kind of looked](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m11s)

[over the the problematic area that they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m13s)

[were going he's like you know what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m15s)

[delete the whole file](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m16s)

[and the the newer person on the team was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m19s)

[a little shocked at that like you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m21s)

[generally don't just delete the whole](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m23s)

[code like rarely is that something that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m25s)

[you do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m27s)

[um but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m29s)

[because they had tests that covered all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m30s)

[of their requirements](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m33s)

[the idea was I can delete that entire](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m35s)

[class and rebuild the entire thing from](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m38s)

[the test from the requirements of my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m42s)

[test to be able to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m43s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m45s)

[having that mental switch is the big one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m47s)

[to do blah blah blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m49s)

[blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m51s)

[blah blah blah blah okay so if you are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m54s)

[interested in the blah blah blah portion](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h11m58s)

[of it YouTube link](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m00s)

[to go watch the video on things because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m01s)

[I don't think I could completely do it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m05s)

[justice without artem we'll do it here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m09s)

[the the key thing here to note is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m10s)

[switching your mentality to doing this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m13s)

[is not a quick switch it is not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m15s)

[something that you just decide one day](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m18s)

[I'm gonna do this this is like trying to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m19s)

[to get in shape right you don't just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m23s)

[decide I'm gonna get in shape go to the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m25s)

[gym once and you're fine right that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m27s)

[not how it works it takes effort it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m28s)

[takes practice it takes training](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m34s)

[the artem's line which I which I laughed](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m34s)

[at and loved and immediately put it in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m37s)

[the slide deck was treat it like a virus](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m39s)

[infecting your code base](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m43s)

[oh cool](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m47s)

[thanks Benjamin](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m48s)

[um and so understanding that actually](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m50s)

[switching to doing test driven](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m53s)

[development will take practice and be a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m55s)

[struggle like that should be an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m57s)

[expectation going into this but it is a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h12m59s)

[hundred percent worth it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m02s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m04s)

[getting all the way through that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m07s)

[there was a couple things that this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m10s)

[basically where we ended our talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m12s)

[because one we were out of time uh and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m14s)

[people were throwing things at me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m17s)

[quite literally watch the video It's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m19s)

[rather entertaining the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m24s)

[so we did technically have one more](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m25s)

[slide on here that I that I wasn't able](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m28s)

[to get to and I kind of knew going into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m30s)

[it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m32s)

[we we've got too much material you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m33s)

[not getting to this last slide which was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m34s)

[fine like we we got we went into it with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m36s)

[the idea that we weren't going to get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m38s)

[here but this is a little bit more of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m40s)

[that practicality of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m43s)

[how do you actually write a good test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m46s)

[because I think at the end of our talk a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m47s)

[lot of people came out of that there was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m50s)

[one person who commented I'm really](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m52s)

[excited to go write tests now and I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m54s)

[like yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m56s)

[yes that's what I want to hear right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h13m58s)

[um and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m01s)

[I didn't want to necessarily leave](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m03s)

[people with the the feel-good mentality](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m05s)

[and the the rah-rah motivation and then](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m07s)

[just throw them to the wolves and let](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m10s)

[them go and hang themselves so this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m11s)

[going to be a little bit more Hands-On](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m14s)

[grounded down on what to do so writing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m17s)

[good tests one give your test a good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m20s)

[name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m23s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m24s)

[um I I usually like name me my test with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m26s)

[the idea of what's being tested under](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m28s)

[what conditions is being tested and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m30s)

[what's my expected outcome right the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m32s)

[what when why](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m34s)

[covering all of those some people like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m36s)

[to have their test names be like longer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m38s)

[sentences I don't really care honestly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m40s)

[what I uh what I told a colleague the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m42s)

[other day is as long as I can read your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m44s)

[test name and understand what's being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m47s)

[tested and what your expectations are of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m50s)

[that test I don't care how you format](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m52s)

[the name right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m54s)

[but unit test names are expected to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m56s)

[somewhat long and verbose and I should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h14m59s)

[use the word unit test test names are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m01s)

[expected to be long and verbose right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m04s)

[the normal naming rules that you would](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m06s)

[apply to methods do not apply to tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m08s)

[um and it they should give out that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m11s)

[information](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m14s)

[right another good reason to name it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m15s)

[this way if you name it with enough](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m17s)

[verbosity GitHub copilot will eat it for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m19s)

[breakfast and fill in the implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m22s)

[for you it is shockingly good at that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m24s)

[shockingly good especially after it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m27s)

[starts seeing the pattern for your tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m29s)

[oh my word copilot's amazing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m34s)

[but circling back to the idea of that uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m38s)

[test driven development and the idea](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m41s)

[that it the point of it is to get you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m43s)

[thinking about what you're actually](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m45s)

[doing one of the big reasons why people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m47s)

[advocate for writing tests first is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m49s)

[because it tries to force you to think](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m52s)

[about what you're actually doing what it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m54s)

[is that you want and more importantly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m56s)

[when you're writing tests I see people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h15m58s)

[write tests without thinking about what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m00s)

[it is they actually need to test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m02s)

[going back to the idea of could you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m05s)

[re-implement a class from your tests if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m08s)

[you if you imagine writing tests that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m11s)

[cover all of your requirements all of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m13s)

[the the things that have come in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m16s)

[that's what you need to write tests on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m19s)

[because some people go well well when do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m20s)

[when do I know if I've written enough](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m22s)

[tests is it when my code coverage is 100](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m24s)

[no that may not you could have a hundred](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m25s)

[percent code coverage and your code may](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m29s)

[not cover all the cases right code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m31s)

[coverage only tells you what code was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m34s)

[executed during a test not that you've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m36s)

[actually exercised all of it your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m39s)

[is tested when you've actually covered](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m42s)

[all of your requirements with tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m44s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m47s)

[one of the things that shocked me was uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m48s)

[I told the story in the talk as well I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m52s)

[was working on the system command line](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m54s)

[project and we were we were discussing a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m56s)

[property it was something that was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h16m58s)

[internal and John one of the leads on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m00s)

[the project made the what seemed like a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m03s)

[dash a statement that this is dead code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m06s)

[we can delete it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m08s)

[and I had Visual Studio open I'm like uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m10s)

[wait what I'm looking at in Visual](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m12s)

[Studio I see references to this property](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m15s)

[how can you say it's dead code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m17s)

[um and he explained his reasoning to me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m20s)

[later that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m22s)

[there were because he's he loves his end](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m24s)

[crutch absolutely loves it there's lots](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m27s)

[of systems out there that will basically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m29s)

[do that auto running of your tests and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m31s)

[give you good indications of what codes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m33s)

[execute by what tests code coverage live](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m35s)

[unit testing whatever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m37s)

[um but what he explained to me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m39s)

[afterwards is that he he had end crunch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m41s)

[open and he saw that that uh property](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m44s)

[wasn't invoked by any of the tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m47s)

[and since it wasn't invoked by any of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m50s)

[the tests and we have tests for all of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m52s)

[our requirements we can delete it now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m54s)

[there's going to be Fallout from that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m57s)

[because there were references to it and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h17m59s)

[so now now we have to go and evaluate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m01s)

[the code that was calling it and you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m03s)

[know see see why it's there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m05s)

[but we can delete it without breaking](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m08s)

[any tests which means the code isn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m09s)

[needed for any functional requirement](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m11s)

[that we have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m13s)

[and that was kind of a a big brain shift](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m16s)

[for me of going hang on hang on wait a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m19s)

[minute](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m21s)

[so code without a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m21s)

[is dead code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m25s)

[he referenced a book to me and I wish I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m27s)

[could remember the title I went out I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m31s)

[went out and ordered a copy of it and I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m32s)

[can't remember what the title was I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m34s)

[think it was working with Legacy code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m36s)

[and I don't remember the author](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m39s)

[um but he had he told me that in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m42s)

[book The the author made the claim that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m44s)

[any code without test is immediately](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m46s)

[Legacy code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m48s)

[again another one of those mental shifts](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m50s)

[to to consider](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m53s)

[okay actually inside your test a very](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h18m56s)

[common pattern](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m00s)

[uh is is and one that I usually enjoy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m02s)

[putting in my test is the arrange act](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m04s)

[assert pattern you'll see people do AAA](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m06s)

[the idea is that you your test should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m08s)

[functionally have three parts I will](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m11s)

[sometimes literally put comments in my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m14s)

[code for each of these of arrange I set](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m16s)

[up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m20s)

[all the everything I need for my test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m20s)

[act which ideally is a single lie](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m23s)

[because hopefully you're testing one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m26s)

[thing it may be multiple but most of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m28s)

[time it's probably a single line the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m30s)

[ACT is the thing that you're testing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m32s)

[which if you imagine testing a method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m34s)

[right it's the method you're calling and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m36s)

[then assert right all of my expectations](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m39s)

[of it and just making sure that your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m42s)

[test is organized in those three](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m44s)

[sections](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m46s)

[um and that you aren't necessarily](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m48s)

[mixing and matching now this gets this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m49s)

[gets a little weird](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m52s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m53s)

[um this is a guideline not a hard and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m54s)

[fast Rule and depending on what you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m57s)

[doing it may actually not be the best](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h19m58s)

[pattern to follow it is a great pattern](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m01s)

[for unit tests it can be a good pattern](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m04s)

[for functional and integration tests it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m08s)

[is likely a bad pattern for UI tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m10s)

[so just do if you imagine uh the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m14s)

[gradient of kind of your fast test of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m18s)

[unit test being on the left all the way](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m21s)

[up to you know your slow you know monkey](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m23s)

[clicking test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m27s)

[that that's kind of a range act assert](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m28s)

[works really well on the fast side and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m31s)

[its value tapers off the further you go](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m33s)

[along uh testing domain logic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m36s)

[yeah that that's another good way of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m40s)

[saying especially if you've separated](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m42s)

[your code to where you have your domain](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m44s)

[logic in a in a different spot that is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m45s)

[it is often a good way of going through](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m49s)

[doing that because most of the time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m52s)

[domain logic can be reasonably unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m53s)

[tested but again](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m56s)

[I'm going to try to do my best to not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h20m57s)

[Focus too much on the categorization of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m01s)

[tests people get really hung up on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m04s)

[what's a unit test what's a functional](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m06s)

[test what's an integration test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m07s)

[um and I I think the better thing to do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m10s)

[is actually to focus on what needs to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m12s)

[tested and at what level](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m15s)

[right and making sure that you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m18s)

[focused on that rather than things like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m20s)

[code coverage or you know what type of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m22s)

[test it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m25s)

[okay uh this one I have been hammering](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m27s)

[my colleagues on repeatedly because they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m31s)

[keep doing it and I keep telling them to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m33s)

[knock it off](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m36s)

[avoid conditions and Loops in your test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m36s)

[so the this gets they they tend to sneak](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m40s)

[in a lot when people learn about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m45s)

[data-driven tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m48s)

[right of ooh rather than you know having](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m50s)

[two tests I can have one test and I can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m52s)

[pass in values to it and do multiple](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m55s)

[things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m58s)

[and then people quickly run into the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h21m59s)

[issue of well hang on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m01s)

[if I pass in a true instead of a false I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m03s)

[I need to change some Logic on what I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m06s)

[doing like these tests are pretty close](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m08s)

[but I need a if statement here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m09s)

[and again these are this is a guideline](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m12s)

[not a hard and fast rule but in general](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m15s)

[I try to to kill off all conditions](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m16s)

[and the reason is is you want your test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m21s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m23s)

[fairly deterministic and unless you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m24s)

[also evaluating like your code coverage](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m27s)

[on your test as well which generally the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m29s)

[code coverage in your test project is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m31s)

[somewhere close to high 90s close to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m33s)

[100.](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m35s)

[um because occasionally there are things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m37s)

[that you put in your test project that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m39s)

[are designed to catch failures and it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m41s)

[only executed in the case of a failure](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m44s)

[right so you may not hopefully have that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m46s)

[case covered but you still want to keep](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m49s)

[it so it's 100 code coverage is never](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m51s)

[really a realistic expectation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m53s)

[but anytime you have a condition it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m56s)

[opens up the possibility for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h22m59s)

[um false positives or false negatives to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m02s)

[creep into your code there was one that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m05s)

[I saw where there was a for Loop that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m07s)

[was written but the uh the termination](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m10s)

[condition right it was a standard for I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m12s)

[equals zero I less than you know I think](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m14s)

[it was list.counter whatever it was in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m17s)

[there you know I plus plus standard for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m19s)

[Loop the problem was the the test was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m22s)

[passing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m26s)

[but the the code that was populating the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m27s)

[list had been broken](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m30s)

[and so the list was empty](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m32s)

[and of a loop and all Loop constructs is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m34s)

[at least in dot net and I think in this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m37s)

[holds true for most languages Java C](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m40s)

[Loops are basically a conditional](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m43s)

[statement with some sort of uh jump to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m47s)

[go along with them right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m51s)

[that that's the definition of a loop](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m53s)

[they're they're just a fancy condition](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m55s)

[with a jump](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h23m58s)

[so they have the same problem as if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m00s)

[statements or any other condition](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m02s)

[and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m05s)

[again conditionals a guideline not hard](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m07s)

[and fast rule if perhaps you put in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m10s)

[condition but you also put in you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m13s)

[an assert on the else condition](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m15s)

[um that's mildly better but there's also](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m18s)

[something to be said about the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m20s)

[complexity of it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m22s)

[right the other one that I saw is a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m23s)

[colleague was trying to do a setup was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m26s)

[trying to put basically three things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m28s)

[into a group](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m30s)

[and so you know 4i equals zero I less](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m31s)

[than three I plus plus you know add the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m34s)

[things into the group and I made the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m36s)

[comment I'm like you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m38s)

[we really should drop this Loop and it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m40s)

[like why like it's not gonna be a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m43s)

[problem it's they're hard-coded values I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m45s)

[can guarantee it's going to run three](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m48s)

[times](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m49s)

[um and we went kind of back and forth on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m51s)

[it a little bit and I went through and I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m52s)

[was like you know I'm not saying you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m54s)

[have to duplicate your code the stuff](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m56s)

[that's inside your for loop three times](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m57s)

[let's pull that out into a method and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h24m59s)

[let's just invoke it three times in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m01s)

[row](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m03s)

[like and in this case invoking a method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m04s)

[three times versus a for Loop](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m07s)

[like the for Loop open curly brace line](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m10s)

[of code closely brace that's four lines](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m13s)

[of code if we move it into a method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m15s)

[inside of your test that shrinks the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m17s)

[number of lines in your test down by one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m20s)

[you're now three you invoke method three](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m21s)

[times and it's fairly straightforward to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m23s)

[read](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m25s)

[so and oftentimes the other drawback](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m26s)

[with conditions and Loops is it adds](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m29s)

[mental overhead just to process it even](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m31s)

[if it's simple](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m34s)

[you may consider looking at refactoring](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m36s)

[those things away because they may not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m38s)

[be needed and again the big risk factor](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m40s)

[is the false positive or false negatives](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m43s)

[creeping in which can certainly happen](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m45s)

[in a lot of different cases](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m47s)

[okay next one keep assertions focused on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m51s)

[what is being tested this one I see](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m54s)

[happen a lot and I always a lot of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h25m57s)

[times when I see bad tests being written](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m02s)

[um specifically bad unit tests a lot of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m05s)

[it comes back to this very first point](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m08s)

[give it a good name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m10s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m12s)

[every single one of your assertions](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m13s)

[should tie back to whatever whatever you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m15s)

[wrote in your test name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m18s)

[some people go really dogmatic and say](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m20s)

[you should have a single assertion per](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m23s)

[test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m25s)

[and I I kind of soften it a bit and go](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m26s)

[yeah psychological assertion you should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m28s)

[you shouldn't only be asserting on the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m31s)

[one thing that you're testing right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m33s)

[whether that takes one assert statement](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m35s)

[or 50 it doesn't really matter as long](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m38s)

[as it's focused on the one thing that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m40s)

[being tested right and coming all the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m42s)

[way back around so if you have a bunch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m44s)

[of assertions and you're testing on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m47s)

[various things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m49s)

[it's a little difficult to to justify it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m51s)

[uh let's see question a method that only](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m54s)

[delegates calling to another method do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m56s)

[we need to test that because that'd be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h26m58s)

[duplicating the unit test that's already](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m00s)

[been created for that delegated method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m02s)

[ah great great question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m04s)

[um this one this one comes up quite a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m08s)

[bit and it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m10s)

[it's when I first saw it it surprised me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m12s)

[because I didn't think that it was a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m15s)

[case that was that common and then the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m17s)

[very next day I found myself writing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m18s)

[those exact methods in in the repo I was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m20s)

[working in and went oh well I guess I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m23s)

[need to eat my words on that one a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m24s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m26s)

[um so so it is fairly common the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m27s)

[so I guess it depends of do you need to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m32s)

[test that because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m36s)

[whether it needs to be tested I think](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m41s)

[depends on the requirements of it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m44s)

[oftentimes what I what I might do and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m46s)

[this is what so I have a system that I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m49s)

[was working on earlier today where I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m52s)

[actually have several methods that are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m54s)

[just like that they delegate out to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m56s)

[another class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h27m58s)

[what I ended up doing is I was like you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m00s)

[know I could test that the thing that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m03s)

[they're delegating to but at the end of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m06s)

[the day I don't actually care](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m08s)

[what I really care about is because the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m10s)

[requirements for what I was doing it was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m13s)

[basically a retry Logic for when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m15s)

[authentication fails or times out making](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m19s)

[sure the user is re-prompted to log in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m22s)

[and all that chance](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m24s)

[I was like you know I could test the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m25s)

[underlying class that's actually doing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m27s)

[the calls to make sure that the you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m30s)

[all the authentication pieces happen I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m32s)

[like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m34s)

[or I could test it at the the top level](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m35s)

[and just verify that effectively the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m38s)

[because there's kind of this complicated](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m42s)

[State machine of you know if the user's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m44s)

[in this state then they get this and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m47s)

[then they get prompted and all around](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m49s)

[I'm like really what I care about is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m50s)

[does](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m53s)

[does the the state flow through that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m54s)

[that state machine properly and under](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m57s)

[the right conditions and so one possible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h28m59s)

[solution is don't test the inner class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m03s)

[test it from test it at that at that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m06s)

[upper class and make sure that behaves](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m09s)

[because really what you're saying is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m12s)

[that when you evoke that outer class you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m15s)

[expect the same behavior as that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m17s)

[delegated method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m19s)

[okay great test write a test Target the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m21s)

[upper level thing and then verify that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m25s)

[you get the same return whether that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m27s)

[method ended up delegating to some other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m29s)

[class to do it or whether it did it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m31s)

[itself](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m32s)

[we don't really care what we care about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m33s)

[is did it do the right thing and so in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m35s)

[one case I went through and did it that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m38s)

[way now that's not always](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m39s)

[that's not always a trivial thing to do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m42s)

[because sometimes you can't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m43s)

[if you're delegating to another call](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m47s)

[sometimes the thing that's being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m49s)

[delegated to it's intentionally been set](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m50s)

[up such that maybe it's set up with an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m53s)

[interface and we'll look at this in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m56s)

[minute of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h29m57s)

[um it's intentionally being set there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m00s)

[because you don't want to invoke it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m01s)

[maybe it's hiding a third party call](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m03s)

[behind an interface so that you can you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m05s)

[know maybe mock it or something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m08s)

[in those cases I would](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m11s)

[if the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m14s)

[if it is important that that delegated](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m16s)

[call get made](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m19s)

[I would I would write the test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m21s)

[however I it will be very subjective](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m23s)

[about whether that's important or not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m27s)

[um and that's going to go back to is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m30s)

[there a requirement that that thing is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m32s)

[satisfying by making that third party or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m35s)

[making that delegated call if the answer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m37s)

[is no it's an implementation detail](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m39s)

[maybe it's a pretty low value test and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m42s)

[not worth right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m44s)

[because there is a cost to some of this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m46s)

[but again it's more about thinking](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m48s)

[through what are the requirements and is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m51s)

[that thing actually satisfying a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m54s)

[requirement or is it an implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m55s)

[detail](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m57s)

[great question feel free to keep them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h30m59s)

[coming I actually love them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m00s)

[um and then act and assert at the same](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m07s)

[level so this is one that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m09s)

[used to be a problem for some people I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m14s)

[work with and I don't think it's been as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m16s)

[big of an issue recently](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m17s)

[um but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m20s)

[when you're writing your tests and again](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m21s)

[this is this is making the assertion](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m23s)

[that or the idea that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m25s)

[you're you're doing something similar to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m27s)

[the arranged act assert pattern so again](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m30s)

[that pattern works best with faster](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m32s)

[tests starts to fall apart as we move](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m34s)

[towards the right for slower tests like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m37s)

[UI tests but assuming we're in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m39s)

[fastish test range where where that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m41s)

[pattern makes sense](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m43s)

[um acting and asserting on the same](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m45s)

[level so if you are acting on you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m47s)

[class Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m51s)

[don't necessarily do your assertions](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m53s)

[um based upon implementation details](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h31m57s)

[this is this is where I see things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m00s)

[happen a lot and it kind of goes back to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m01s)

[that your question earlier about do you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m03s)

[test the delegated method or not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m06s)

[is oftentimes especially when people are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m08s)

[using mocks I will see them go through](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m11s)

[and they will they'll do all their](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m13s)

[setups on their mocks they'll they'll](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m16s)

[run their tests and then they'll verify](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m17s)

[that all of the setups on their box were](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m19s)

[invoked](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m21s)

[and that's not necessarily A Bad Thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m23s)

[but you are effectively building a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m27s)

[regression test that pins the internal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m30s)

[implementation to invoking those mocks](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m32s)

[and so the the question should always be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m35s)

[asked is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m37s)

[are you testing the behavior or the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m40s)

[implementation and that's not always a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m44s)

[clear lie right it's an easy sentence to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m46s)

[say but sometimes you get into code it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m49s)

[kind of murky about what matters](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m51s)

[right the the the story from earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m54s)

[about could you delete your whole class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h32m58s)

[and then rebuild it from your tests kind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m00s)

[of usually helps me think through okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m03s)

[if I were to delete this class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m06s)

[right or if I were to just hand my test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m08s)

[to somebody else on the team could they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m10s)

[implement](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m12s)

[the the class correctly right would I be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m13s)

[confident that if I took my test and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m17s)

[handed it to somebody else that they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m19s)

[would then give me back something that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m22s)

[if all of my tests passed I would be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m25s)

[comfortable with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m27s)

[right or are my tests so tightly coupled](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m29s)

[to some implementation detail that you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m32s)

[know I've asserted down at a much lower](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m35s)

[level than what I was actually acting on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m37s)

[so so again these are guidelines not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m40s)

[hard and fast rules](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m44s)

[right so there there is no Silver Bullet](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m46s)

[uh and I couldn't resist the pun but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m48s)

[test it right and sleep better at night](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m52s)

[because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m54s)

[what would a PowerPoint slide be without](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m56s)

[some useless puns and a light bulb](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h33m58s)

[because you have to have that that's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m00s)

[requirement](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m01s)

[okay so after our talk and I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m03s)

[real quick I'm gonna deviate because I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m05s)

[see for anybody who's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m07s)

[missed the link earlier there's there's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m10s)

[a link again this is a continuation on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m12s)

[um a talk that me and a colleague artem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m15s)

[did earlier this week](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m18s)

[um but I got a bunch of questions](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m20s)

[um after our presentation and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m23s)

[unfortunately we didn't have time to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m26s)

[dive into all of them and so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m28s)

[I have compiled a list of them here and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m31s)

[kind of cleaned them up and reworded](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m34s)

[them a little bit to make them a little](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m36s)

[more generic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m37s)

[um but they were they were great](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m39s)

[questions that I think are probably very](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m40s)

[relevant in a lot of cases so uh so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m43s)

[question one working on a legacy code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m47s)

[base that's gone through several](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m48s)

[revision no tests written in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m49s)

[beginning code not written with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m52s)

[testability in mind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m54s)

[for most of us this is the standard](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m56s)

[Brownfield development mentality right I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h34m57s)

[worked for a professional services](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m00s)

[company which is a consulting firm a lot](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m02s)

[of times this is the situation we get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m05s)

[called it right there's some Legacy code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m07s)

[testability was an afterthought or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m09s)

[non-existent right and then the question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m12s)

[being uh what are your thoughts on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m15s)

[adding unit tests for such Legacy code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m17s)

[is it worth even adding the tests should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m19s)

[tests only be added when bugs show up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m21s)

[and this is a great question because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m23s)

[oftentimes people come into these Legacy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m26s)

[code bases and it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m30s)

[how like you can look at it go](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m32s)

[this is this is hard and unwieldy one of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m36s)

[the things that artem and I touched on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m39s)

[in the talk was the idea that testing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m41s)

[actually makes developers happy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m44s)

[we like cats](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m47s)

[like we like knowing that we can make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m49s)

[changes to a code base and we didn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m52s)

[break anything you can all anybody who's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m54s)

[worked with any large project has](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m57s)

[probably heard this whole idea well](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h35m58s)

[don't touch that because if you touch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m00s)

[that this other stuff breaks](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m02s)

[and it's like really how was I supposed](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m05s)

[to know that what like was there a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m07s)

[no there's not a test but there's this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m09s)

[you know tribal knowledge that we all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m10s)

[have that says you don't touch class Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m12s)

[because the whole world Falls over when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m15s)

[we don't know why right it sounds](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m17s)

[ridiculous to think about people using](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m19s)

[like appeals to ignorance to justify it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m22s)

[but it happens a lot](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m27s)

[and so you get into that mindset of oh I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m27s)

[can't touch code now you're now you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m30s)

[fearful of the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m33s)

[and it's and it's like well I I don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m34s)

[want to change anything uh sorry slight](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m37s)

[tangent](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m40s)

[but adding Co adding tests to a legacy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m41s)

[code base so my opinion is yes it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m45s)

[worth adding tests now it is rarely in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m50s)

[business best interest to spend](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m53s)

[depending on how big the project is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m56s)

[hundreds of Dev hours going and writing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h36m58s)

[tests for all of their stuff right that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m02s)

[is that is rarely](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m04s)

[rarely worth it and yes gives a comfort](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m07s)

[level yes yes or in my case reduces my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m10s)

[anxiety](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m14s)

[because there's anxiety when I don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m16s)

[know if I've broken things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m17s)

[but because there's likely not to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m19s)

[business time allocated to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m21s)

[uh to just writing a ton of tests uh of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m24s)

[over everything that's not tested](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m28s)

[probably not in the business best](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m30s)

[interest now sometimes that does happen](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m32s)

[we've been called in on projects where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m35s)

[people are like we've got this business](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m37s)

[critical application we're tired of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m39s)

[there being tons of bugs please write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m41s)

[tests please automate the tests this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m44s)

[you know we've got every time we do a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m46s)

[release it takes our QA teams you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m48s)

[two weeks to test it all we'd like to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m51s)

[automate that process so that we can get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m53s)

[released out the door right sometimes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m55s)

[the business actually goes hey tests are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h37m57s)

[a good thing let's build them out right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m00s)

[that does occasionally happen](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m02s)

[um but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m06s)

[just blindly doing it without that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m07s)

[directive you should just go and do it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m10s)

[so should tests only be added when bugs](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m13s)

[show up I would probably extend it a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m15s)

[little Beyond just when bugs show up in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m18s)

[an ideal situation you should write a so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m21s)

[Kevin's opinion you should write a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m25s)

[anytime the requirements of what you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m28s)

[working on can be easily captured with a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m31s)

[test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m33s)

[right because there are some features](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m35s)

[that come down come down the pipe that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m37s)

[are not easily captured in those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m40s)

[requirements aren't easily captured with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m43s)

[a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m46s)

[right uh we'll get into some of the talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m47s)

[because I know there's questions coming](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m50s)

[up around like UI testing and unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m51s)

[testing stuff later on as well](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m53s)

[um but even some that are more like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m55s)

[subjective level things of I want this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h38m58s)

[to look pretty](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m00s)

[okay great like we have we have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m02s)

[designers when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m05s)

[um that go out and are tasked with hey](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m08s)

[we'd like you to fix up the design of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m10s)

[this site and oftentimes their pull](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m12s)

[request is going to be a bunch of like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m14s)

[CSS changes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m19s)

[do is it worth writing uh a test over](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m21s)

[that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m24s)

[not as much right that that's uh does it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m27s)

[look right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m30s)

[okay there might be elements of it that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m31s)

[are worth that are worth testing right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m33s)

[like you can imagine the essential C](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m35s)

[sharp side I saw the um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m37s)

[the little hyperlink icon if you hover](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m40s)

[over the the heading right maybe it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m42s)

[worth writing a UI test to make sure](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m44s)

[that hey when I when I move the cursor](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m46s)

[over the heading I expect to be able to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m48s)

[copy the link right that's a very firm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m49s)

[requirement that I can put into a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m52s)

[does the does the heading look pretty](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m54s)

[it's not a firm requirement that I can't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m56s)

[put a test on so figuring out where that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h39m58s)

[goes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m02s)

[when I no one adding domain logic and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m04s)

[features bugs occurred is too late yeah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m06s)

[though depending on what it is so even](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m10s)

[on the domain logic and features](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m12s)

[sometimes I think it is still worth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m14s)

[building out the tests for it so even on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m17s)

[Legacy code bases](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m21s)

[there's often an element of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m23s)

[still building new stuff onto it and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m25s)

[again it depends on exactly what is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m27s)

[going on so this is very subjective but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m30s)

[sometimes you're bolting a new thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m33s)

[onto an old code base](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m35s)

[and so that new thing can sometimes be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m39s)

[written in a way that is testable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m41s)

[and does work well sometimes you're you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m43s)

[know interweaving in with the Legacy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m46s)

[code and that's not as reasonable to do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m48s)

[right so it depends a lot on exactly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m50s)

[what's being done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m53s)

[um a test for when a bug shows up is and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m55s)

[the comment there about a bug occurred](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h40m58s)

[is too late is is absolutely correct the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m01s)

[if you write a test after a bug shows up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m04s)

[which you're effectively writing is a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m06s)

[regression test to make sure](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m08s)

[uh that the bug doesn't re-break later](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m11s)

[right your test didn't prevent the bug](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m14s)

[you're just preventing you know future](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m16s)

[you from reintroducing the bug uh that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m18s)

[what I meant was time to write tests ah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m21s)

[perfect yes uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m23s)

[so writing tests when bugs show up is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m26s)

[good and it can be helpful](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m29s)

[um but one of the things that I've been](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m32s)

[trying to get uh one of the teams that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m35s)

[I'm on to do is to identify areas in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m38s)

[code that are especially problematic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m41s)

[right because we can all probably think](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m45s)

[of this one looking at at our repos what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m48s)

[areas are the worst it in my in in my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m50s)

[dream picture what I would love is to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m54s)

[able to have like a class diagram](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m56s)

[overlaid with a heat map of bugs that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h41m58s)

[what I would love the problem is is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m01s)

[that's getting that correlation from bug](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m03s)

[to class diagram is not always trivial](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m06s)

[or obvious so it's but if I could have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m09s)

[my ideal thing I would love that because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m12s)

[then that would](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m17s)

[go hey Andrew yes tonight is on testing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m18s)

[and I'm going to redrop the link I this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m21s)

[is a bit of a continuation on a a talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m23s)

[me and a colleague gave earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m26s)

[but yes yeah it helps guard against the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m28s)

[regression of bugs absolutely](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m31s)

[um but it doesn't stop it and so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m34s)

[if you can identify areas that are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m36s)

[especially problematic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m39s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m41s)

[potentially worth writing tests around](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m43s)

[that area](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m46s)

[um so if there's an area that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m49s)

[identified as problematic and the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m51s)

[requirements of that area are fairly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m53s)

[well known it is probably worth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m55s)

[considering writing tests around that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m57s)

[area now again I think both of those two](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h42m59s)

[things have to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m01s)

[easily identifiable and again this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m02s)

[very subjective now there's not an easy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m06s)

[way to do this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m07s)

[um if you but if there's an area that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m09s)

[problematic and the requirements are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m12s)

[well known](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m14s)

[writing tests around uh around it to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m15s)

[verify that those requirements are met](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m19s)

[could potentially save you future bugs](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m22s)

[and pay right and start getting and at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m24s)

[minimum getting that code into a state](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m27s)

[where it's either more testable uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m30s)

[and cleaned up makes it easier to fix](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m36s)

[bugs into the future even if they don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m38s)

[necessarily stop them just getting it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m40s)

[structured that way](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m43s)

[we'll set it up for future success the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m45s)

[other thing that's worth considering is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m48s)

[how often the code is expected to change](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m50s)

[now if there's bugs being filed against](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m52s)

[it people are going in and fixing them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m54s)

[that means the code isn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m56s)

[stationary or static right it's it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h43m59s)

[being modified the I joked with artem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m02s)

[that you know if your code if you never](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m06s)

[need to update or change your code again](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m09s)

[you don't need to write tests and he](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m11s)

[kind of gave me a about well I don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m14s)

[know about that but I was like yeah hear](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m16s)

[me out like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m19s)

[if if it never needs to ever change you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m21s)

[don't need to write tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m24s)

[now I count changing as if somebody](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m26s)

[files a bug and you go in and fix it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m29s)

[you're changing the code right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m31s)

[um and rarely is there ever a situation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m34s)

[where you aren't changing code like but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m36s)

[if you know somebody has an Enterprise](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m38s)

[application that nobody's touched in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m39s)

[five years should you go and write tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m42s)

[over it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m44s)

[probably not if no one's had to touch it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m45s)

[in five years](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m47s)

[is it really worth that in the test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m48s)

[probably not like the tests are are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m51s)

[giving you that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m54s)

[that design feedback and if you aren't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m56s)

[really designing anything with it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h44m59s)

[it might not be worth it uh so we had a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m01s)

[feature around scheduling inspections uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m04s)

[and a test around the core functionality](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m07s)

[and the edge cases really cut down on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m09s)

[the amount of bugs after release that is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m11s)

[awesome I love hearing that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m13s)

[um I will brag on a couple of my my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m16s)

[co-workers real quick so I got a message](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m18s)

[from one of them said hey we're having](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m21s)

[this threading problem you know for some](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m23s)

[reason they think I know something about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m26s)

[threading and they're like would you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m28s)

[mind pairing with us on this and taking](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m30s)

[a look at it and I'm like sure why not a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m32s)

[Threading problem sounds like fun let's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m34s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m35s)

[so I jump in a call with them and they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m36s)

[share their screen and the first thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m39s)

[they go is okay so we wrote a test and I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m40s)

[went Hallelujah I was like thank you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m43s)

[thank you they're like we were trying to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m46s)

[track this down](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m48s)

[um because one of the things that gets](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m49s)

[missed a lot is that your test Runner is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m51s)

[probably a lower cost startup than](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m54s)

[whatever app you're you're you would be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m57s)

[manually firing up yourself anyway](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h45m59s)

[right I I really love it when I what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m02s)

[I've gotten a section of code to the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m05s)

[point where I I'm working on the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m07s)

[I'm I'm writing the tests and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m10s)

[by the time all of my tests are green I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m12s)

[run the app at the end just to you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m15s)

[make sure everything's fine but I have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m17s)

[such a high degree of confidence that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m19s)

[everything's working after my tests are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m21s)

[done that running the code is you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m22s)

[just making sure everything's looking](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m25s)

[right and it works the way I expect](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m26s)

[because I'm really confident that my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m27s)

[tests have covered it that is most one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m30s)

[of the most wonderful feelings ever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m32s)

[um there was a a comment I got from John](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m35s)

[that that really kind of stuck with me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m37s)

[of you can't really](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m39s)

[you can't really get somebody to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m43s)

[understand what this is like until they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m47s)

[go and do it themselves one of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m49s)

[example I used in the talk uh earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m52s)

[this week was the idea of I can show you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m55s)

[pictures of my vacation and how](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h46m58s)

[wonderful it was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m00s)

[but unless you go there and experience](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m01s)

[it yourself it's not the same right and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m03s)

[with all of this testing stuff all I can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m07s)

[do is show you pictures of it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m09s)

[I can't like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m13s)

[I can just tell you how wonderful it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m15s)

[but until people actually get to work in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m17s)

[that environment and experience it it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m20s)

[really really hard so for what it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m22s)

[worth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m26s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m27s)

[so uh one other final point on here the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m29s)

[cost of new tests on Legacy code is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m32s)

[quite High because of the cost of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m34s)

[refactoring it to make it reasonably](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m36s)

[testable uh often the tests are written](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m37s)

[without refactoring the the actual](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m40s)

[production code and that bloats the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m42s)

[range portion part of the test to being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m44s)

[unreadable monsters which](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m47s)

[I get that though there's a few things I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m49s)

[would comment on this as well right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m51s)

[after a Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m53s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h47m58s)

[one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m00s)

[a statement I made in the the talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m02s)

[before was that the quality of your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m05s)

[will tend towards the quality of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m08s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m10s)

[so if you met for those of you have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m11s)

[taken advanced mathematics and you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m13s)

[familiar with limits you know how a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m15s)

[function will tend towards a value](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m17s)

[my opinion is that the the quality of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m21s)

[your apps code will tend towards the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m24s)

[quality of your tests so if your test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m27s)

[project is the wild west and things are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m29s)

[chaotic and crazy your apps code is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m31s)

[going to start to tend towards chaotic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m34s)

[and crazy it might not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m36s)

[but it it will start to lean that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m38s)

[direction right the tests give the guide](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m41s)

[rails it's goes along with the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m43s)

[Broken Window Theory of of codeine as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m46s)

[well the idea that you should fix the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m49s)

[thing that's wrong because the moment](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m51s)

[you say well that's a low priority thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m53s)

[we we'll just ignore it well then the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m54s)

[next low priority thing gets ignored](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m57s)

[then the next one and things start to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h48m58s)

[Compound on top of each other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m00s)

[whereas if you insist on a a high degree](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m02s)

[of quality in your tests it's going to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m06s)

[be very difficult for your code to start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m08s)

[to drift so the so bloating the arranged](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m10s)

[portion of the test I often spend quite](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m14s)

[a bit of time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m17s)

[excuse me uh refactoring my test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m18s)

[projects](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m22s)

[people get really hung up on this idea](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m23s)

[of making sure that tests are clean I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m25s)

[um a colleague of mine I was pairing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m30s)

[with him earlier today and the moment he](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m31s)

[had to duplicate a piece of code the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m33s)

[first thing he did and he's a writer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m35s)

[fanatic so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m37s)

[go writer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m39s)

[um is you know highlight the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m40s)

[extract into method boom boom done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m42s)

[right he's like nope we're not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m44s)

[duplicating this you know if if I need](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m46s)

[this thing in two places darn it I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m48s)

[gonna put it into a shared method I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m51s)

[going to name it sometimes pulling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m53s)

[things into a method just so that a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m55s)

[chunk of code can have a name associated](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m57s)

[with it right sometimes people get this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h49m59s)

[idea that oh well it's not worth putting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m01s)

[it in a method unless](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m03s)

[um unless I need it in multiple places](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m06s)

[sometimes it's worth putting it in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m08s)

[method just so you can attach a name to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m10s)

[a block of code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m12s)

[right you can put a comment above it but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m14s)

[the problem with comments is comments](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m17s)

[don't always give you a clear start and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m18s)

[end](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m21s)

[and comets can very easily drift away](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m22s)

[from the code that they were commenting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m25s)

[right it's it's very easy for them to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m27s)

[for for to find comments in the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m29s)

[that have no relevance to the code that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m31s)

[they're commenting going what the heck](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m33s)

[whereas a method the compiler is going](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m35s)

[to check you you aren't going to mess](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m38s)

[anything up so sometimes a method is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m39s)

[actually worth it just to attach a name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m43s)

[to something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m45s)

[um and so if if uh if it's bloated the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m47s)

[arranged portion of the test my my first](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m51s)

[question would be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m54s)

[could that be refactored again without](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m55s)

[changing the production code at all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h50m58s)

[could the test code be refactored to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m00s)

[make it not an unreadable monster I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m02s)

[think in a lot of cases I can get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m05s)

[even unreadable tests down into a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m08s)

[readable state](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m10s)

[um and then they also go back to the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m12s)

[idea of if the test name clearly spells](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m14s)

[out what I'm testing I would hope that I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m17s)

[could get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m20s)

[the the arranged portion down to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m22s)

[something that resembles the test name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m24s)

[uh start with visual tests first if need](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m26s)

[be before rack refactoring make sure you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m29s)

[don't break it but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m31s)

[uh but reducing uh coupling is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m32s)

[beneficial in and of itself yeah and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m35s)

[that that's a strategy I've seen](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m38s)

[mentioned many times for people working](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m40s)

[in Legacy code bases is before changing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m42s)

[the method especially if it's if you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m45s)

[look at a bit of code and you're not con](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m48s)

[you're not sure of exactly what it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m50s)

[doing sometimes writing some tests over](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m52s)

[exactly what it's doing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m55s)

[and then go in and doing the refactor](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h51m58s)

[can be quite helpful](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m00s)

[right just to just to start getting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m02s)

[yourself to that point where then you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m04s)

[can make sure you aren't breaking things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m05s)

[as you go that that is a strategy I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m07s)

[seen in a lot of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m09s)

[uh uh refactoring](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m11s)

[have you reached out to Mountain Dew for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m14s)

[a sponsorship yet you joke but I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m15s)

[actually looked at their website and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m18s)

[they actually have a page up that says](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m19s)

[not accepting new sponsorships](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m21s)

[so have I reached out no am I aware that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m25s)

[such a page exists yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m28s)

[I don't know if that's good or not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m30s)

[okay next question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m33s)

[um often when working on Windows desktop](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m39s)

[applications there's a common pattern of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m41s)

[don't test or don't unit test UI code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m43s)

[and this can result in developers](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m45s)

[putting additional code in the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m47s)

[behind since it's less work due to the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m48s)

[lack of testing required uh how can we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m51s)

[convince people to implement separation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m54s)

[and test into such a code base ah so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m56s)

[there's a couple couple great bits in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h52m59s)

[here so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m03s)

[confession time I think I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m06s)

[no I have not written a gift of action](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m08s)

[for that Benjamin](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m10s)

[um so first the comment of don't uh unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m12s)

[test UI code so I do a lot of WPF work](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m15s)

[and WPF is notorious for this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m19s)

[uh uh the UI portions of WPF are pretty](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m21s)

[well on unit testable they are very very](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m26s)

[difficult to and specifically I'm going](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m29s)

[to say unit test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m32s)

[um and the reason comes back down to how](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m34s)

[they're structured there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m36s)

[static coupling built into the the UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m38s)

[classes specifically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m40s)

[system.windows.application it's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m43s)

[nightmare to deal with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m45s)

[they they require you your test to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m47s)

[running on an sta thread rather than an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m50s)

[MTA thread which most testing Frameworks](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m52s)

[are going to be running as so you end up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m54s)

[having to do some work around that as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m56s)

[well](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m57s)

[um and then oftentimes because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h53m58s)

[uh to unit to unit test a UI component](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m02s)

[um you have to basically simulate the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m07s)

[the WPF shell or the window in order to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m09s)

[get it going](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m12s)

[which is not usually very trivial](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m14s)

[um uh so what is sta versus MTA thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m18s)

[great question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m21s)

[so uh so it's single threaded apartment](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m22s)

[versus multi-threaded apartment I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m25s)

[believe I've got those terms correct](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m28s)

[um effectively UI thread versus](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m30s)

[background thread is is what it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m32s)

[um what it comes down to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m35s)

[so with with WPF specifically the UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m37s)

[components can only be accessed from the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m41s)

[STA thread that uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m45s)

[um that created them a little known fact](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m48s)

[you can have more than one UI thread in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m51s)

[a WPF application not common but is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m53s)

[possible which is why I say that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h54m59s)

[the the user control can only be touched](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m00s)

[by the UI thread that created most](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m04s)

[people think of it as I have my one UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m06s)

[thread and then I've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m08s)

[background threads a lot of times that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m09s)

[realistically all you have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m12s)

[sometimes there's more](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m14s)

[um not not often not common but it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m16s)

[there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m18s)

[um yeah and the the subtle differences](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m21s)

[if you actually get into like the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m23s)

[system.threadings.thread uh apis you'll](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m25s)

[see those two values come up I believe](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m28s)

[there's an enum on the threads](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m31s)

[Constructor if I'm not mistaken](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m33s)

[um but we so rarely create threads](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m37s)

[ourself in C sharp at least because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m40s)

[threads are heavy uh for fun create a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m42s)

[thread and look at how much memory it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m46s)

[allocates it's about a Meg](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m48s)

[like there's a lot that goes into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m51s)

[spinning a thread which is why you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m53s)

[should probably rarely do it ever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m54s)

[um we have things like TPL the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h55m58s)

[background worker queue all this stuff](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m00s)

[at our disposal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m02s)

[um rarely is spinning a a full thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m04s)

[the right solution not saying it's never](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m08s)

[the solution because there's certainly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m11s)

[cut times where it comes up but it's not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m12s)

[always if you're spinning a thread you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m14s)

[should be real intentional about why](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m19s)

[so coming coming back to this so so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m21s)

[don't uh unit test UI code so with all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m24s)

[of that on WPF and how miserable it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m27s)

[to unit test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m29s)

[um I will admit I I helped the team](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m31s)

[write a definition of done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m33s)

[and I may have included a line in there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m36s)

[about not unit about UI code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m39s)

[specifically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m42s)

[um oh thread pool thank you yes another](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m44s)

[good thing to use rather than spending](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m47s)

[your own thread but I may have put a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m48s)

[line on that definition of done that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m50s)

[said something along the lines of you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m52s)

[know xaml and xaml.cs files don't need](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m54s)

[unit tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m57s)

[so pretty much fell right into this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h56m58s)

[common pattern](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m01s)

[um and that was largely based on the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m04s)

[idea of hey](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m06s)

[um I know how difficult slash impossible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m08s)

[it might be to write this test only](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m12s)

[because the framework that you're built](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m14s)

[on really wasn't made for it at all like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m16s)

[no](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m20s)

[um no one would accuse WPF of being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m22s)

[testable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m24s)

[uh so I I totally get the the common](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m26s)

[pattern and doing it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m32s)

[however with that said we often push to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m34s)

[move any business related logic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m38s)

[out of the UI code so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m41s)

[developers putting a code in the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m44s)

[behind since it's less work this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m46s)

[there's a subtle switch happening here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m51s)

[where the first part is related to a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m53s)

[technological limitation and the second](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m55s)

[part is related to a people problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h57m58s)

[and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m01s)

[there's a there's an interesting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m02s)

[conundrum that I that I've noticed a lot](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m05s)

[is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m08s)

[oftentimes there's a desire to solve](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m09s)

[people problems with technological](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m11s)

[solutions and it just never works](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m13s)

[ever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m17s)

[to the point where I'm convinced that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m18s)

[you can't solve a people problem with a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m19s)

[technological solution](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m21s)

[which is part of why artem and I wanted](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m23s)

[to do this testing talk because the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m25s)

[biggest testing problems we see are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m28s)

[people problems not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m30s)

[technological ones so the idea of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m33s)

[developers putting code into the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m36s)

[behind to avoid needing to write the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m38s)

[test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m40s)

[I don't think it's really a technical](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m42s)

[problem and it's a mindset problem if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m43s)

[the developers are viewing the tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m47s)

[effectively as regression tests and not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m49s)

[as design feedback](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m52s)

[if the tests were being used as a way of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m55s)

[designing your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h58m58s)

[and getting your thinking correct](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m00s)

[the code wouldn't have been put there in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m03s)

[the first place](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m05s)

[so I I think the answer here is a little](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m07s)

[bit of one I totally get this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m13s)

[of of don't unit test UI code yeah we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m14s)

[strive for no code behind files except](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m17s)

[for controls yeah I we do something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m19s)

[similar though we also will leverage](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m22s)

[behaviors and whatnot in various places](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m25s)

[and there's always value converters that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m28s)

[might do some interesting stuff but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m30s)

[value converters are relatively testable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m31s)

[is rough because behaviors often are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m35s)

[registering up for events](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m41s)

[but yeah you don't yeah in WPF you don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m42s)

[actually have to have the code behind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m45s)

[file that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m46s)

[um even though it shows up on the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m48s)

[default item templates when you create](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m49s)

[it you can just get rid of those like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m51s)

[they don't need to exist](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m54s)

[um and people actually they know this in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m57s)

[WPF they just don't realize it because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=00h59m59s)

[there is an item template that you can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m01s)

[gen that doesn't come with a code behind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m04s)

[file it's a resource dictionary and so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m06s)

[people intrinsically know oh yeah user](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m10s)

[control comes with a code behind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m12s)

[resource dictionary doesn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m13s)

[they don't realize that one you can add](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m15s)

[a code behind to a resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m17s)

[you probably don't need to but you you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m21s)

[can and you could drop the code behind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m23s)

[from the user control so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m25s)

[for what it's worth those are just two](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m28s)

[different starting templates but you can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m30s)

[beat one into the into the same setup as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m32s)

[the other if it's put into the code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m35s)

[behind then it'll it'll be for a UI test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m37s)

[right same thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m39s)

[so yeah it you are correct if you put it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m41s)

[in the code behind the the reasonable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m44s)

[place to test it is is a UI test that is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m46s)

[absolutely correct](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m53s)

[the disadvantage is if the expectation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m54s)

[is that because I've seen a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h00m57s)

[where UI tests don't get written because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m00s)

[the further to the right you get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m02s)

[the cost of building the test goes up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m04s)

[right unit test is fairly cheap then you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m07s)

[get like your functional and integration](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m10s)

[tests and I wrote a Blog but hang on let](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m11s)

[me grab that blog](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m13s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m16s)

[Protech shift left](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m18s)

[yay boom yeah so I wrote this blog post](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m22s)

[I'm gonna get rid of all the ugliness on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m26s)

[the end of the URL for everybody](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m28s)

[but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m33s)

[because people often get hung up on the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m36s)

[categorization of tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m38s)

[and categorization of tests is good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m40s)

[to some extent but it gets applied in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m45s)

[lot of places where it doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m47s)

[and so this is often like I usually try](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m48s)

[to describe it to people on this idea of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m51s)

[a gradient right assuming you're in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m53s)

[a.net land or a compiled language your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m56s)

[very first s is your compiler like did](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h01m58s)

[you type the right syntax into the file](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m01s)

[and and everybody's developers were just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m04s)

[we just accept that this is our first](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m07s)

[test right we we don't even think about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m09s)

[it as a test because it happened so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m11s)

[often but it the compiler is the first](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m13s)

[thing that's testing to make sure that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m15s)

[the code we typed is actually legit or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m16s)

[at least syntactically legit and then we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m19s)

[get into like unit testing land of fast](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m21s)

[tests and then we we move kind of into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m24s)

[our integration functional slower test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m26s)

[type things as they move across and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m28s)

[maybe some automated UI tests as we move](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m31s)

[further over and then we get into like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m33s)

[manual monkey clicking QA level tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m35s)

[and then whether you like it or not any](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m38s)

[software worth it salt has users and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m41s)

[your users are going to exercise your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m44s)

[code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m46s)

[whether they want to or not and if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m48s)

[you're building something for like an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m51s)

[Enterprise app they may be forced to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m52s)

[test your code whether they want to or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m53s)

[not so I oftentimes try to like look at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m55s)

[it from a gradient perspective because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m57s)

[people get really caught up in and you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h02m59s)

[know where's the line between you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m01s)

[unit tests and integration tests where's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m03s)

[the line between integration and UI test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m05s)

[and again I don't have fixed lines](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m08s)

[they're blurry](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m12s)

[right and it comes back to knowing what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m13s)

[exactly is it that I'm trying to test at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m16s)

[each level acceptance test yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m18s)

[yeah and there's I think there was a a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m21s)

[list of different testing methodologies](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m25s)

[that I saw](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m27s)

[and I went through the list I'm like oh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m28s)

[shoot I didn't realize there was that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m30s)

[many](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m31s)

[there was like 16 of them on there I was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m32s)

[like really](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m34s)

[that's a lot but when you start pulling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m36s)

[people to ask them about the various](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m38s)

[types of testing that they do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m39s)

[there's quite a bit and the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m41s)

[the definitions for each can vary from](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m45s)

[Team to team a little bit which is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m48s)

[which is really messed up oh yeah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m51s)

[mutation testing fuzz testing is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m53s)

[behavioral driven testing yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m56s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m58s)

[so the the thing in here that I that I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h03m59s)

[would argue for so this the second](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m03s)

[portion of this I would argue is a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m06s)

[people problem not a technological](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m08s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m09s)

[and I think how can we convince people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m11s)

[to implement separation and test into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m13s)

[such a code base I think it's to one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m15s)

[start with trying to change their idea](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m19s)

[of what tests are for right this sounds](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m21s)

[like the idea is that tests are a second](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m24s)

[class Citizen and that tests are written](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m27s)

[after the fact and not worth as much](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m30s)

[until that mentality switches and the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m33s)

[idea is that the tests Drive the quality](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m36s)

[of your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m38s)

[um and your code is going to tend](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m40s)

[towards the quality of your tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m41s)

[until that mentality changes and people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m43s)

[understand that hey I should be using](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m47s)

[tests to design out this and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m48s)

[I need to have this quality here this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m52s)

[won't necessarily change that there are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m54s)

[people solutions to some of these like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m56s)

[one of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h04m59s)

[um oftentimes uh doing consulting work](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m00s)

[we will push teams to go through and and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m04s)

[like sit down and legitimately write a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m07s)

[team working agreement like if if part](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m10s)

[of the team is really unhappy about code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m13s)

[being pushed into the code behind put](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m15s)

[like actually hash it out and have the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m17s)

[team come to an agreement of okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m19s)

[you know we're going to put in our team](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m22s)

[working agreement you know as much as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m23s)

[possible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m26s)

[don't put code into code behind right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m27s)

[that's something you could get a team to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m31s)

[do and then hopefully there are code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m33s)

[reviews happening and then once there's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m35s)

[a team working agreement there hopefully](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m38s)

[is no debate right if a pull request](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m40s)

[opens and the developers loading up a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m42s)

[code behind it's like whoa whoa whoa](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m43s)

[whoa whoa I thought we said we weren't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m45s)

[going to do that right there's a team](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m46s)

[working agreement](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m48s)

[right everybody agreed to this why why](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m50s)

[like go change it right there shouldn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m53s)

[be much argument at that point but again](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m55s)

[at that point it's all a people problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m57s)

[and not a technological one so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h05m59s)

[I think the key thing to convince them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m01s)

[is change the mindset and then](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m04s)

[after that it's going to be a people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m07s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m10s)

[uh mutation testing is the one to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m13s)

[discover how good your testing is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m17s)

[yeah you didn't add a feature until you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m20s)

[have test to prove it and you shouldn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m23s)

[have to create a controller window to do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m26s)

[that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m28s)

[I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m29s)

[I mostly agree with that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m31s)

[I the only exception I'm going to put on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m33s)

[there is there are times where uh we get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m36s)

[user stories about making sure that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m40s)

[um a particular ux internet interaction](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m44s)

[works](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m47s)

[and you can only](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m48s)

[you can only prove a ux interaction](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m51s)

[works by having sort of some sort of UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m53s)

[interaction portion of the test now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m56s)

[whether that's an automated test or a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h06m58s)

[manual one that is always up for debate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m00s)

[right one of the projects I work on we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m03s)

[we have a piece of software that's used](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m05s)

[for working with video and one of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m08s)

[requirements that we often get is this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m11s)

[file should work in in the player](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m13s)

[that that's not an easy thing to capture](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m16s)

[in a in a test right that's a very Lucy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m18s)

[thing but it's also something that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m22s)

[really requires having some sort of UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m24s)

[like I can crack the file open and start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m27s)

[looking at the data of the video](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m29s)

[but we work with so many different types](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m31s)

[of things that it's what is correct is a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m33s)

[real gray area for us](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m37s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m40s)

[ah so abstractions are an overhead uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m42s)

[some think that code gets more](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m46s)

[complicated to read and follow when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m48s)

[abstractions I.E interfaces are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m50s)

[introduced uh they can be seen as a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m52s)

[necessary evil in order to be able to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m55s)

[mock dependencies what are some good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m57s)

[arguments and persuading people that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h07m59s)

[abstractions are worth it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m01s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m03s)

[yeah agree domain features not ux to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m06s)

[prove that it's done yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m09s)

[um and on the the team that I'm on now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m11s)

[we actually even went to the effort](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m15s)

[because we're using devops pipelines you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m17s)

[can get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m20s)

[um code coverage add-ons that will even](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m21s)

[um auto block PRS if you want them to if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m25s)

[the the code coverage of new stuff in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m28s)

[the pr isn't appropriately covered](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m32s)

[so we don't have it blocking the PRS but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m35s)

[we do have it posting the code coverage](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m37s)

[right on the the pr](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m39s)

[that way it's real obvious to everyone](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m41s)

[what the code coverage is of the pr and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m43s)

[if your code coverage is crap you can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m46s)

[probably expect a comment](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m50s)

[oh great question do you use just walk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m52s)

[or tight mock to mock third-party](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m54s)

[dependencies that doesn't have interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m55s)

[virtual methods uh used it to create a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h08m57s)

[wrapper adapter but it's tiring to do it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m00s)

[every time uh so I have used just mock](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m02s)

[in the past I haven't used type mock but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m06s)

[I'm I'm going to go out on a limb and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m08s)

[guess that it's a similar situation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m10s)

[where it allows](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m12s)

[uh quote unquote mocking of uh static](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m14s)

[methods or whatnot](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m18s)

[um there are there are a number of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m20s)

[libraries out there that give you access](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m22s)

[to do that hold on Shameless](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m24s)

[self-promotion time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m26s)

[Shameless self-promotion time I even](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m28s)

[gotta know I even got annoyed with the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m30s)

[lack of stuff at one point and I wrote a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m33s)

[library called nose plug](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m35s)

[that effectively does static level](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m40s)

[mocking so it has a very mock moq](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m43s)

[type style](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m46s)

[um it leverages Harmony to Monkey patch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m48s)

[static methods](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m50s)

[um which does come because it's built on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m53s)

[Harmony there are some limitations of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m55s)

[Harmony that are worth knowing about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m56s)

[specifically method inlining can really](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h09m58s)

[hose you with this Library](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m00s)

[but it is an option and it's worth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m02s)

[noting sometimes you have to test code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m05s)

[that smells I tried to name this Library](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m07s)

[very appropriately to point out that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m09s)

[this is a Band-Aid over a different](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m12s)

[problem it's not a solution just to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m15s)

[throw that out there right sometimes you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m17s)

[have to use something like just mock to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m20s)

[go after a dependency that is not easy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m22s)

[to get at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m25s)

[um and there's not a there's not a good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m27s)

[way around it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m29s)

[um so have I used those in the past yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m32s)

[um they are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m37s)

[if you were working in a legacy code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m39s)

[base or in or for whatever reason you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m41s)

[working with something that you are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m44s)

[unable to change whether it's your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m45s)

[or a third party because sometimes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m48s)

[you're not unable to change your own](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m50s)

[code due to other constraints](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m52s)

[right sometimes in those situations it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m54s)

[worth doing the the big risk factor with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h10m57s)

[a lot of these static mocking libraries](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m01s)

[is you oftentimes find yourself](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m03s)

[using them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m09s)

[as a way of smoothing over what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m10s)

[otherwise would be a nice test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m12s)

[right of you know as part of this method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m14s)

[it's going to call this third party](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m17s)

[Library](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m18s)

[I can't do that as part of my test so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m20s)

[you know I'm going to use just mock to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m22s)

[to break it which is fine it's just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m24s)

[worth noting that then your test has](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m27s)

[some coupling then into the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m30s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m32s)

[right anytime you use one of these](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m34s)

[libraries to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m36s)

[to mock a static your test in addition](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m37s)

[to the method that you're testing being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m41s)

[coupled to that static your test is also](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m42s)

[coupled to that static as well which](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m45s)

[starts to bring it starts to bring](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m48s)

[things together so if refactoring is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m50s)

[possible that is generally preferable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m53s)

[however refactoring is not always an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m56s)

[option](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h11m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m01s)

[so where possible a refactor is good now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m02s)

[I'll Circle back to this question more](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m06s)

[in a minute because I want to kind of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m07s)

[address this a good example for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m09s)

[abstraction is date time.now and that so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m11s)

[it's funny you bring that up because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m14s)

[that's one that's actually changing in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m15s)

[dot net 8. because since the dawn of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m18s)

[time date time.now has just been a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m22s)

[static property and now they're putting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m24s)

[in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m28s)

[a method of being able to make it behave](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m29s)

[deterministically specifically for tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m31s)

[but yeah nose plug I use it for things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m33s)

[like date time dot now where it's like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m36s)

[I don't really want to put an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m39s)

[abstraction between my code and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m40s)

[daytime.now that's kind of a worthless](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m42s)

[abstraction](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m45s)

[right and that's kind of what's being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m46s)

[hinted at in this question here right of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m49s)

[if I'm going to go after daytime.now I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m51s)

[can put datetime.now behind an interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m54s)

[for no other reason other than my code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h12m57s)

[no longer uses date time.now instead it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m00s)

[uses you know insert my date time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m03s)

[interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m04s)

[and I will use that so that I can make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m06s)

[my code behave deterministically so that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m09s)

[I can you know test dates in the future](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m11s)

[test dates in the past do things like uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m12s)

[leap year or Daylight Savings Time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m16s)

[shenanigans that kind of thing right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m19s)

[because I you know I I don't want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m21s)

[trust that I have to run my tests at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m23s)

[those times of the year I just want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m25s)

[put it into that state and go](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m30s)

[and that is certainly a possibility and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m32s)

[there is a time and a place for that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m37s)

[um one of one of my colleagues favorite](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m40s)

[questions to ask people during an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m42s)

[interview is what's the difference](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m44s)

[between an interface and an abstract](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m46s)

[Base Class and when do you use each](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m47s)

[and to some degree I hate the question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m50s)

[because any anyone that I'm interviewing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m53s)

[if the person has a like a computer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h13m56s)

[U.S for those people outside](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m04s)

[that's one of the kind of like academic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m07s)

[questions that I would expect any](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m09s)

[graduate can at least give me an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m12s)

[academic answer of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m14s)

[right I usually like to ask the question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m16s)

[differently of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m22s)

[what is an interface and how and how do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m24s)

[you use it because my opinion our](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m26s)

[interfaces are one of the sharpest types](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m29s)

[in all of.net they are so so easy for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m31s)

[anyone to declare](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m36s)

[and they are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m38s)

[so often done so poorly that it makes me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m40s)

[Twitch like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m43s)

[they are the one of the easiest things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m45s)

[for people to get wrong](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m48s)

[um and I say that because on an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m50s)

[interface uh like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m52s)

[all you have is you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m55s)

[uh member declarations](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m57s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h14m59s)

[um it doesn't help that latest versions](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m01s)

[of c-sharp added things like default](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m03s)

[interface members access modifiers on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m05s)

[interface members those things all got](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m08s)

[added making it even easier for people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m10s)

[to misuse an interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m12s)

[drives me crazy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m15s)

[um but interfaces are very easy to mess](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m17s)

[up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m21s)

[because they really require you to make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m22s)

[to be really conscious about your return](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m25s)

[interfaces the parameters coming in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m30s)

[because if you just slap a like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m33s)

[oftentimes what I'll see people do is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m35s)

[they'll declare a class they'll do all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m36s)

[the work in it and then they'll realize](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m38s)

[ah shoot I kind of wanted to mock the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m40s)

[uses of this for a test oh I know I'll](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m42s)

[make an interface and I'll just copy all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m44s)

[of my method signatures into the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m47s)

[interface done I'm like oh dear Heavens](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m49s)

[no please stop doing that that is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m52s)

[horrible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m55s)

[um because an interface and because the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m56s)

[what the what the computer science](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h15m59s)

[graduate gives me is an academic answer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m02s)

[is well an interface is a contract right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m04s)

[it declares how two things are to talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m07s)

[to each other which](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m09s)

[if if you are a college graduate being](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m11s)

[interviewed by me expect the question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m14s)

[and if you give me that answer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m16s)

[you'll be okay that that's fine if you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m18s)

[want to get the gold star here's what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m21s)

[you see you should hint at something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m23s)

[more like this Beyond just a contract](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m24s)

[the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m27s)

[um the interface is where you actually](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m30s)

[design what the code should look like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m32s)

[and this is where if you're using](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m34s)

[interfaces and tdd this is this is one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m36s)

[of the Prime places where you can start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m40s)

[to leverage it because it it will start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m43s)

[to give you an idea of is this a good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m46s)

[design](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m48s)

[yes I like that phrasing communicates](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m49s)

[intention and responsibility yes that is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m52s)

[a see that would earn a gold star](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m55s)

[um Beyond just the contract and once you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h16m58s)

[realize that the interface is supposed](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m01s)

[to do that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m02s)

[you start to look at the names of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m04s)

[members on interfaces and go hang on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m06s)

[how wait do those things go together](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m10s)

[does that name even make sense maybe it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m12s)

[makes sense on the implementing class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m15s)

[but does it make sense on the interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m16s)

[right and so being able to build those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m19s)

[types of things out get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m21s)

[um they are so so easy to mess up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m24s)

[um I will say on the on this question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m27s)

[here abstractions are an overhead I will](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m29s)

[agree with that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m32s)

[having an abstraction is a bigger](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m35s)

[overhead than not having an abstraction](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m37s)

[100 I can I can agree with that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m40s)

[however](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m43s)

[the the ABS the the abstraction there is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m44s)

[more than just a necessary evil I would](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m47s)

[say it's in some cases desirable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m50s)

[because it the the necessary evil comes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m55s)

[in into play when people are like I want](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h17m59s)

[these two classes to be coupled together](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m02s)

[right to call the interface if you have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m05s)

[you know class Foo calling class bar](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m08s)

[right if there's no interface there Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m10s)

[calls bar everyone's happy right there's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m13s)

[coupling between those classes so be it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m17s)

[right Foo is coupled the bar](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m19s)

[if we put bar behind an interface and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m22s)

[now Foo talks to ibar right now we've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m24s)

[decoupled them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m28s)

[rather than a necessary evil the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m30s)

[question should be is that coupling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m31s)

[desirable or not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m34s)

[right if you're if you're putting in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m36s)

[interface just so that you can mock](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m38s)

[something where that coupling was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m40s)

[desirable you have caused a problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m41s)

[because I don't actually like the idea](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m44s)

[of just slapping interfaces on all my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m46s)

[dependencies sometimes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m48s)

[I like using the real classes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m51s)

[why not right people who get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m54s)

[um mock obsessed uh using mocks for all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h18m57s)

[coverage and will often still find bugs](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m03s)

[in their code and the bugs will creep in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m06s)

[at the point where the mock that you've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m08s)

[made on your interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m11s)

[bugs to creep in now I am not saying](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m32s)

[mocks are bad](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m35s)

[I'm one of the maintainers of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m36s)

[automarker library I love MOX MOX mocks](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m38s)

[serve a purpose](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m41s)

[um however the I see people overuse them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m44s)

[and oftentimes they overuse them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m48s)

[specifically coupled with interfaces](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m50s)

[because they go ah I know that in order](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m52s)

[for this thing to work I need to mock](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m55s)

[wants an interface or at least something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m58s)

[with virtual members that it can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h19m59s)

[override](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m01s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m03s)

[but breaking that coupling may not be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m04s)

[necessary I used the example earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m07s)

[where I was testing a class that had](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m10s)

[some tight coupling to a to another](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m12s)

[class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m14s)

[I didn't bother to test the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m15s)

[um the delegated class that it was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m20s)

[calling into I just tested from the top](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m22s)

[level to make sure that the interaction](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m24s)

[between all of those classes worked as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m27s)

[expected I don't care right if that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m29s)

[coupling exists and my my top level](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m33s)

[entry point uh going into those classes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m35s)

[works](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m39s)

[I don't care about the stuff under the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m40s)

[hood right now with that said mocks are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m42s)

[still very good when it's like I want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m44s)

[make sure my code handles you know this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m46s)

[particular exception correctly right I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m48s)

[need my dependency to throw an exception](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m50s)

[in this case great mocks are golden for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m51s)

[that right when you have a requirement](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m54s)

[that says you know given this Behavior I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m55s)

[want to do y That's where a mock will](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h20m58s)

[shine right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m03s)

[yeah it's better than having some large](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m04s)

[implementation with the nebulous design](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m06s)

[that doesn't communicate its intent and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m08s)

[purpose that is true that is true and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m10s)

[that's that's where I would argue that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m12s)

[if you have a class calling into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m14s)

[something that is you know large](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m15s)

[nebulous name that doesn't communicate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m18s)

[its intent or purpose there's probably](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m19s)

[some potential refactor to go in there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m21s)

[and this is where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m23s)

[tdd really helps right because when you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m25s)

[start looking at it if it's difficult to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m29s)

[either name your test or understand what](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m32s)

[the test is doing from the name this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m35s)

[actually one of the things that I love](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m37s)

[about copilot copilot when you write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m39s)

[your test it'll try to write your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m41s)

[implementation for you and it blind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m42s)

[guesses](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m44s)

[but I guess is based upon the patterns](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m46s)

[that it's seen in your previous tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m48s)

[and how you formulated your name which](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m49s)

[is pretty cool because once if you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m52s)

[consistent it means it just writes tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m55s)

[for you and it eats your stuff for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m57s)

[breakfast](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h21m59s)

[but the what's really interesting is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m00s)

[when it's raw](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m02s)

[right because when it's wrong it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m04s)

[oftentimes is guessing what the API](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m07s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m09s)

[because it's going you know if you were](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m10s)

[consistent everywhere this is what I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m12s)

[think your API should be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m14s)

[now not saying you should rename your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m16s)

[stuff to match whatever copilot says](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m18s)

[because that's probably horrible too but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m20s)

[it's interesting to at least consider](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m24s)

[right and say oh that's interesting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m26s)

[would that be a better name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m29s)

[right would that be a better structure](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m32s)

[right because it's just blind guessing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m34s)

[right it it's going well I think based](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m36s)

[upon what I know that it'll be this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m39s)

[and I should say blind guess it's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m43s)

[really smart educated guess](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m45s)

[but it's it's an interesting thing to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m46s)

[look at and start to realize that if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m48s)

[you're writing the test first around](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m50s)

[what you want the the requirements to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m52s)

[or what the requirements are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m55s)

[and you're capturing those in a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h22m57s)

[oftentimes I like to let co-pilot just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m00s)

[write out that implementation and then I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m02s)

[look at it and go huh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m05s)

[okay let's consider if that is a good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m07s)

[structure or not right does it align](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m10s)

[with the requirements because if I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m13s)

[named my test well it's often trying to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m15s)

[infer what by a range act and assert](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m17s)

[should be based upon my name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m20s)

[and you know sometimes it's wrong it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m22s)

[like no stupid copilot don't do that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m24s)

[you're wrong right because it's it's not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m26s)

[brilliant but it's but it's worth doing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m28s)

[um circling back what are some arguments](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m32s)

[to persuade people that abstractions are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m34s)

[worth it I think what I would say here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m36s)

[is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m38s)

[I would](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m39s)

[I think both sides are probably wrong](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m43s)

[um and not necessarily wrong per se but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m48s)

[potentially approaching it incorrectly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m51s)

[the idea that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m57s)

[that you should slap an interface into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h23m58s)

[mock I think is incorrect I think the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m00s)

[idea should be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m04s)

[you should use it to evaluate coupling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m05s)

[and then interfaces should be evaluated](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m08s)

[on their own without regard for the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m11s)

[implementing class](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m15s)

[right interfaces should be evaluated](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m17s)

[from the caller's perspective](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m19s)

[right is this the right API](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m21s)

[the the the phrase the phrasing that you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m25s)

[put in the earlier blue spider about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m28s)

[communicates intention and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m29s)

[responsibility I think is a good way of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m31s)

[evaluating when looking at an interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m33s)

[of does it communicate the intention and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m36s)

[responsibility of all implementing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m39s)

[classes and some people are like well we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m41s)

[only have one implementing class and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m44s)

[then we have a bunch of mocks no each](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m46s)

[mock is is an implementer of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m47s)

[interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m49s)

[right and your test goes against it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m50s)

[the yeah the audience of it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m53s)

[so I think I would say that is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h24m58s)

[is evaluate evaluate it there and then](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m00s)

[going on the other side is I wouldn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m04s)

[always say that abstractions are always](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m06s)

[worth it I I do think there are times](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m09s)

[where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m11s)

[type coupling between two classes is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m13s)

[perfectly acceptable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m16s)

[it just means and this is something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m19s)

[worth evaluating right if I if I've got](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m21s)

[if I've got class Foo and it's tightly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m24s)

[coupled to bar if I can test all of Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m26s)

[and the fact that it's tightly coupled](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m29s)

[to Bar doesn't matter to my tests I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m31s)

[don't care](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m33s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m35s)

[bar is an implementation detail of Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m36s)

[the fact that they're tightly coupled](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m38s)

[doesn't bother me in the least right if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m40s)

[I can test Foo just fine](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m43s)

[the I don't need to have an eye bar](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m46s)

[right bar can just be there and they can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m49s)

[be tightly coupled now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m52s)

[if I can't test Foo because of bar now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m55s)

[we might question the coupling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h25m59s)

[right and that's where you that's where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m01s)

[you start to do to go back and forth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m03s)

[um I'd like to see good examples that I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m06s)

[wish](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m08s)

[I will see if I can put something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m10s)

[together because I the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m11s)

[the sample I did earlier today is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m15s)

[unfortunately in a business project and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m17s)

[I can't share that code but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m20s)

[I will go and look](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m23s)

[uh so we don't need to mock everything](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m25s)

[no](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m28s)

[no oh here's a here's here's an example](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m30s)

[I can share](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m34s)

[um project I was working on was using uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m36s)

[newtonsoft uh for Json serialization](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m41s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m44s)

[um newtonsoft has been the top Json](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m46s)

[serializer for many many years](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m48s)

[um tops the nuget chart download numbers](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m51s)

[and all that stuff so many people are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m54s)

[familiar with it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m57s)

[um but the the project I was working on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h26m58s)

[didn't want to couple themselves to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m01s)

[newtonsoft so they put it behind uh an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m03s)

[interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m06s)

[right so the the actual serialization](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m07s)

[was behind an interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m10s)

[as part of the test so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m12s)

[serializer behind interface right move](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m15s)

[on we're now we're now testing class Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m18s)

[class Foo needs to use the serializer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m21s)

[um and so in the in Foose Constructor it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m26s)

[took in you know the the interface for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m29s)

[the serializer and then in its method it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m31s)

[was it was using it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m33s)

[um and I made the comment because I was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m35s)

[looking at the unit test for Foo and I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m36s)

[was like you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m38s)

[you're you're mocking away the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m41s)

[serialization why not just use the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m43s)

[serializer like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m46s)

[uh because again](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m48s)

[I'm an auto mock person I love it I'm](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m50s)

[like just give Auto mocker the the real](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m53s)

[serializer instance don't do this weird](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m55s)

[mocking on the interface for the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m58s)

[serialize just give it the real one and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h27m59s)

[turn it loose right why why do we care](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m01s)

[right so Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m03s)

[at that point was you was doing it but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m06s)

[rather than necessarily mocking it away](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m09s)

[and I wouldn't have been too](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m11s)

[disappointed to see Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m13s)

[uh if it wasn't for the way the rest of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m15s)

[the project was structured I wouldn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m17s)

[have been opposed to fooaccessing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m19s)

[newtonsoft.json directly inside of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m21s)

[code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m23s)

[right to do its serialization do I care](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m24s)

[that Foo is tightly coupled to Newton](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m27s)

[soft Json serialization](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m29s)

[not really what I cared about is what I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m32s)

[call Foo do I get do I get the behavior](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m35s)

[that I would expect and a big portion of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m38s)

[what the the method on food was doing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m39s)

[was cloning some objects using Json](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m41s)

[serialization right so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m44s)

[for people unfamiliar with it a cheap](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m45s)

[trick to get a deep clone on an object](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m48s)

[is serialize out deserialize now I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m50s)

[got](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m54s)

[new new object instances with the same](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m55s)

[data it assumes your your data type is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h28m58s)

[serializable All That Jazz](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m00s)

[plenty of caveats but it's a it's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m02s)

[cheap trick when when it works right and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m04s)

[for pocos it's perfect](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m10s)

[but I don't care if Foo](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m11s)

[accesses a serializer directly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m15s)

[right and if it wants to do that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m18s)

[serialization great](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m21s)

[right that's in that's an implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m23s)

[detail if I'm testing that Foo is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m25s)

[effectively doing a clone per se right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m29s)

[what I'm interested in testing is do the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m31s)

[instances I get back are they a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m34s)

[different instances than the ones I sent](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m37s)

[in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m39s)

[uh and uh two do they contain the same](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m40s)

[data right and this might be a case](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m43s)

[where an approval test uh would be a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m45s)

[very reasonable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m48s)

[way of approaching it because you've got](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m49s)

[potentially a deep object structure that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m51s)

[you want to compare right makes it easy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m53s)

[to see those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m55s)

[um those separations so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h29m57s)

[um I I think for this like I said I I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m00s)

[think I would argue](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m02s)

[that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m04s)

[necessary evil is potentially the wrong](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m06s)

[phrasing and that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m08s)

[you you don't need to mock everything](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m11s)

[um however you should evaluate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m15s)

[that you should evaluate your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m20s)

[dependencies to to decide what should be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m21s)

[mocked right mocking and interfaces](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m24s)

[should be done intentionally in your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m27s)

[code with thought they shouldn't just be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m29s)

[a blind oh I put an interface there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m31s)

[that's probably the wrong one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m36s)

[uh coupling often leads to issues in my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m37s)

[experience that is true right coupling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m39s)

[is definitely an area that can bite you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m42s)

[in a lot of in a lot of places and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m44s)

[coupling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m47s)

[um coupling can even come in in various](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m49s)

[subtle ways like the date time.now case](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m51s)

[right it's really easy to have code that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m54s)

[uses daytime.net](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m57s)

[kind of a pain to test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h30m59s)

[right and so those those types of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m01s)

[coupling things can come in but again I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m05s)

[think the key thing is to evaluate those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m06s)

[those dependencies and decide on whether](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m08s)

[they are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m12s)

[whether they are an implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m16s)

[detail](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m18s)

[or an appropriate place where you should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m19s)

[put a seam in your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m21s)

[right I think that's the key the key](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m23s)

[switch I would make there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m32s)

[so let's see when something doesn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m34s)

[depend on heavy time consuming](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m35s)

[dependency like database or timer and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m37s)

[contains just like it's usually fine](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m39s)

[with tight coupling](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m41s)

[um yes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m44s)

[um I think that it's probably a fair](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m47s)

[phrase and like I said I would just make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m50s)

[sure it is just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m52s)

[very intentional about where where you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m55s)

[take the coupling right coupling should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h31m58s)

[be should be an intentional decision as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m02s)

[well as dependencies and I think](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m05s)

[oftentimes people try to approach it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m06s)

[from one of the two extremes of I just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m09s)

[always throw an interface or and that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m11s)

[way there's no coupling or I always](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m14s)

[tight couple all the things and both](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m16s)

[extremes I think are wrong I think the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m18s)

[right answer is being intentional in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m19s)

[middle](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m22s)

[uh and so you never think about bison](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m23s)

[for clone uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m24s)

[I've used it in the past in this case](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m27s)

[the project was already using newtonsoft](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m29s)

[so it was an easy win](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m31s)

[but yeah there's there's there's other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m34s)

[options for going through and doing it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m37s)

[in our case because it was already an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m39s)

[object that was being serialized to Json](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m41s)

[for other purposes it made it an easy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m43s)

[way to clone it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m45s)

[uh also dispatcher](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m51s)

[yeah dispatcher's a fun one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m53s)

[um specifically in like the WPF](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m56s)

[dispatcher because it is one of those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h32m58s)

[areas where your code often](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m02s)

[will need it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m06s)

[and this is this is a an artifact of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m08s)

[wpf's framework so uh past videos I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m11s)

[covered like the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m15s)

[um Community mvvm toolkit one of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m17s)

[common problems](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m20s)

[um with the the relay command](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m22s)

[that is there is you can call what is it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m24s)

[uh notify can execute changed](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m28s)

[I think that's the the name of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m32s)

[method on the relay command the problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m33s)

[is you can't call that method from a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m36s)

[background thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m38s)

[and this is where things get awkward](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m40s)

[because you now have a relay command](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m42s)

[which is very much something that should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m44s)

[live in your view model](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m46s)

[and a method on that relay command that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m48s)

[has to be invoked from a UI thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m51s)

[and that can get really awkward really](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m54s)

[fast because now you have something in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m56s)

[view model which shouldn't know about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h33m59s)

[the UI that needs to care about the UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m01s)

[thread for when it invokes a method on a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m04s)

[viewmodel object](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m07s)

[and it's really awkward and so the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m08s)

[common way around it is people put you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m11s)

[know this dispatcher behind an interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m14s)

[right and then have that thing that they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m17s)

[go through a mock which is fine right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m19s)

[like you can totally do that that is an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m22s)

[option](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m24s)

[um there is a a pattern that I like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m26s)

[um the port adapter simulator](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m30s)

[um and the idea being that rather than](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m35s)

[using mocks for all of your interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m36s)

[dependencies you actually write uh so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m38s)

[you let's use dispatcher as the example](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m42s)

[we have an eye dispatcher right you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m44s)

[would have an implementation of eye](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m46s)

[dispatcher which uses your actual](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m48s)

[um applications dispatcher class it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m51s)

[basically just forwarding method calls](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m53s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m55s)

[um and then you have a second dispatcher](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m56s)

[that is used for a second implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h34m59s)

[of it that is primary usage is for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m02s)

[testing but maybe all it does is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m06s)

[directly invokes the delegate right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m08s)

[because dispatcher is going to have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m10s)

[members on it like invoke async where it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m11s)

[takes in a delegate and just invokes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m15s)

[that delegate on the UI thread right but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m17s)

[for maybe for the testing one your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m20s)

[implementation just straight invokes the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m22s)

[delegate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m23s)

[um one of the things that can be very](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m26s)

[helpful to do is to if you write that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m28s)

[second implementation of your I dispatch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m31s)

[rather than just always using mocks for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m34s)

[it write a concrete implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m37s)

[and then more importantly write tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m40s)

[for that concrete implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m42s)

[right that's the important part ideally](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m45s)

[if you can have tests that go against](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m48s)

[both the uh the concrete implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m50s)

[uh that is the application dispatcher as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m54s)

[well as your uh in memory one and then](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h35m57s)

[once you have assurances that you're in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m00s)

[memory the one that's just blindly](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m03s)

[invoking your delegate is working](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m04s)

[you then can use that in all of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m07s)

[tests rather than box and that will](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m10s)

[eliminate the case where bugs sneak in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m12s)

[due to you having a mock that you didn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m15s)

[configure to match the appropriate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m18s)

[behavior](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m20s)

[right if I've got this implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m21s)

[and I know that I want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m24s)

[invoke a sink you know when I call them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m27s)

[okay sync on my I dispatcher I expect](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m29s)

[that delegate to be called right if I do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m31s)

[a mock without a setup](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m33s)

[by default it's not going to invoke the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m35s)

[delegate on that parameter and so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m37s)

[everywhere where I expect it to work I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m40s)

[have to do a setup and say okay I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m42s)

[dispatcher setup when invoke async is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m44s)

[called grab the parameter invoke that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m46s)

[delegate blah blah blah just so that my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m48s)

[test works](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m51s)

[but instead if I write a you know an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m52s)

[in-memory dispatcher](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m55s)

[that has an implementation of invoke](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h36m57s)

[async and all it does is blindly invoke](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m00s)

[the delegate and I write tests to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m02s)

[guarantee that that behavior works I can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m04s)

[use my in-memory dispatcher on all my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m06s)

[other tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m08s)

[to make sure that I don't have that that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m10s)

[blind spot uh in my code area](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m13s)

[the other thing that I I tend to do a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m17s)

[lot is because I like automocker so much](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m19s)

[which hang on more more Shameless uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m23s)

[self-promotion](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m26s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m33s)

[again Shameless self-promotion I'm a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m35s)

[maintainer I'm biased](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m43s)

[um this Library which is severely](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m44s)

[lacking in documentation and I apologize](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m47s)

[for that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m50s)

[um this automocker instance basically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m51s)

[acts as a lightweight](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m54s)

[um di container or dictionary of types](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h37m57s)

[and so oftentimes I will write extension](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m00s)

[methods that basically pre-populate this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m03s)

[dictionary with any of those in-memory](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m05s)

[instances that I want](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m07s)

[right that way I can do you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m09s)

[automocker add all my stuff right and it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m11s)

[gets loaded with all my stuff and then](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m15s)

[when I go oh okay Auto marker create](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m17s)

[instance of car I know that it's going](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m19s)

[to use my memory instances rather than](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m22s)

[MOX for say I drivetrain or whatever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m24s)

[it's going to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m27s)

[right so it can it can save you a little](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m28s)

[bit of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m30s)

[of setup costs and again this just comes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m32s)

[back to the idea of if I see a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m34s)

[where it's a pain for me to write the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m37s)

[arrange portion of it I start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m38s)

[refactoring until it's not painful](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m40s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m42s)

[and basically I go and tell I'm happy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m44s)

[which means I've improved my developer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m46s)

[enjoyment that level may be different](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m48s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m50s)

[uh doesn't WPF fact solve the call in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m51s)

[the UI fed problem from a test no](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m58s)

[so the WPF fact](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h38m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m02s)

[attribute for X unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m03s)

[uh what that does is it changes the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m05s)

[calling thread of your unit test so X](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m09s)

[unit by default you get background](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m12s)

[threads calling calling each of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m14s)

[unit test methods when you decorate it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m16s)

[with WPF fact instead it's not a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m19s)

[background thread that's invoking you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m22s)

[anymore it's a UI thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m23s)

[now that that works around some problems](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m25s)

[specifically if you're writing a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m30s)

[that goes against a UI object because](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m32s)

[most WPF UI objects will do things like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m35s)

[am I being called from a UI thread or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m39s)

[not that sta thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m41s)

[and if not I throw an exception and die](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m44s)

[and we all we all go home unhappy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m46s)

[so that's all WPF fact does it doesn't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m50s)

[fix calling the UI thread problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m53s)

[completely because if the method that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m56s)

[you're calling does something like you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h39m59s)

[know a weight task.yield right at the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m02s)

[beginning](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m05s)

[everything after that is now on a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m07s)

[background thread so it may so all WPF](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m09s)

[fact does is start your test on a UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m12s)

[thread it doesn't guarantee that you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m15s)

[will always be on a UI thread](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m17s)

[um at the point you need it right so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m20s)

[that may not always be an easy thing it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m23s)

[just starts the test there the other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m25s)

[drawback of of it is it's it also makes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m27s)

[tests slower it also raises the question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m30s)

[of depending on what you're testing WPF](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m33s)

[fact is fine if you're writing a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m36s)

[you get something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m38s)

[um like a behavior that maybe you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m40s)

[your behavior needs to touch some UI](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m43s)

[elements but you know we still want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m45s)

[test our behaviors great fine it works](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m47s)

[well for those situations](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m50s)

[um if you're using WPF fact on something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m52s)

[like a view model that's a red flag that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m55s)

[something's wrong because view models](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h40m58s)

[shouldn't need to know about UI threads](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m01s)

[the relay command method be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m06s)

[notwithstanding but in general your your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m08s)

[view models should not have UI objects](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m11s)

[in them they should not need to know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m13s)

[about UI threads that's not a thing they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m15s)

[should care about your view models are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m17s)

[designed around the business logic](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m19s)

[ux logic of of the app that you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m22s)

[building](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m25s)

[oh one other one other thing that I I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m28s)

[want to that I wanted to pull out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m33s)

[and my API so the the port adapter](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m35s)

[simulator pattern that I was mentioning](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m39s)

[and I will drop](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m40s)

[some links here in a moment](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m45s)

[let me find this guy I don't know where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m46s)

[there's been so many refactors in here I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m49s)

[might have to might take me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m52s)

[there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m54s)

[uh okay so so here we go so so here's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h41m56s)

[some links](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m00s)

[so so link one this is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m01s)

[this is icons](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m05s)

[right very simple interface there's not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m07s)

[a lot to it right there's some extra](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m09s)

[interfaces here standard out standard](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m12s)

[error standard in whatever right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m14s)

[important part this is a an interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m15s)

[right then there is uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m25s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m25s)

[terminal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m29s)

[one of the where is I'm gonna go back](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m31s)

[code searches where is the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m34s)

[implementation of eye console](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m40s)

[uh there it is system console test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m43s)

[console so this is a beautiful example](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m46s)

[of the the thing that I was mentioning](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m49s)

[earlier about having](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m51s)

[two implementations right so icons will](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m53s)

[interface system console this thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h42m57s)

[doesn't do much more than shell out the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m00s)

[system.com](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m02s)

[right straight up that's purpose in life](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m04s)

[is it just hides system.console behind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m07s)

[interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m10s)

[right test console](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m12s)

[also implements the icons interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m15s)

[but you'll know there's a surprising](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m18s)

[difference here this thing is not going](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m20s)

[straight out this is just building up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m22s)

[some string builders](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m25s)

[and so it's completely in memory of all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m27s)

[this guy is doing it's just writing out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m31s)

[to string builders](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m34s)

[so it's completely in memory](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m36s)

[okay and then if we go and look at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m38s)

[the system command line rendering](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m43s)

[say rendering tests I think is where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m47s)

[this thing lives](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m50s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m51s)

[uh where is the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m53s)

[so this is uh this is worth noting so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h43m59s)

[you'll note the the system console](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m03s)

[terminal test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m09s)

[this is not quite what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m10s)

[but this might be the level at which](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m12s)

[they were tested tested at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m13s)

[I think this might be the the way they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m17s)

[would test that you'll know this is just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m19s)

[a very simple test class that derives](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m21s)

[from terminal tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m24s)

[terminal tests down here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m28s)

[are all of these tests are written](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m29s)

[against I terminal and I realize I was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m31s)

[showing eye console earlier and I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m33s)

[switched to I terminal so work with me](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m35s)

[here I didn't know I was showing this so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m36s)

[I didn't prep anything](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m40s)

[see test terminal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m41s)

[terminal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m45s)

[one of these guys here is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m48s)

[one of these guys here has the alternate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m55s)

[implementation but this is where the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h44m57s)

[terminal tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m01s)

[terminal tests ah there we are got it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m04s)

[um this this then is testing both the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m10s)

[in-memory implementation and the real](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m14s)

[implementation against a set of common](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m16s)

[tests to make sure that they behave](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m19s)

[medley not a lot](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m22s)

[there's then some additional tests on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m24s)

[the in memory one to make sure it it has](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m26s)

[some specific behavior that is not easy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m29s)

[to have a common test against but all of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m33s)

[these tests mean that test terminal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m36s)

[now ships in the the actual main project](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m39s)

[test terminal doesn't live in the unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m42s)

[test project](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m44s)

[because we've got tests over it to say](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m46s)

[yeah this is a good implementation it it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m48s)

[matches all of our requirements](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m52s)

[ship it why not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m54s)

[but it then means that in all of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h45m57s)

[tests where we needed an eye terminal we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m00s)

[now have an in-memory implementation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m02s)

[that we can just drop in whenever we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m04s)

[want](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m06s)

[and know that it's going to be a good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m08s)

[implementation without any mocks there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m10s)

[are no mocking no mocks used anywhere](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m12s)

[inside of the system command line](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m16s)

[Library](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m17s)

[which surprised me but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m20s)

[there are no mocks in here so it very](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m23s)

[heavily leverages the idea of we're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m26s)

[going to write our own dependencies](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m28s)

[every time we put in an interface which](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m30s)

[also](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m32s)

[really lends itself well to think to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m34s)

[an intentional and thinking through](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m37s)

[those interfaces and those apis right if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m39s)

[you know that you're gonna have to write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m42s)

[two implementations every time you add](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m44s)

[an interface you're real intentional](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m46s)

[about doing those interfaces you're also](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m48s)

[real intentional about making sure that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m50s)

[you don't populate the interface with](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m52s)

[too many worthless members right and by](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m54s)

[the time you're writing that second](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m57s)

[class mocks unfortunately don't do a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h46m58s)

[good job of validating your interface](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m01s)

[signatures right because if all you have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m02s)

[is the one real class that you wrote](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m05s)

[that implements it the mock is going to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m07s)

[just adopt whatever you put but if you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m09s)

[have to write two implementations of it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m12s)

[you start to realize really quick when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m13s)

[you've got a member on an interface it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m16s)

[like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m18s)

[that really doesn't belong here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m18s)

[right this is real specific to one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m21s)

[implementation and not the other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m23s)

[okay perfect you've just identified a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m25s)

[problem with your interface let's go fix](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m28s)

[it right so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m30s)

[pros and cons to each](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m33s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m37s)

[let's carry forth](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m38s)

[I remember how many of these I've got uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m39s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m42s)

[ah this is a wonderful one how do you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m44s)

[ensure that the tests are good unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m47s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m49s)

[oh I think they were supposed to be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m51s)

[square brackets about unit a second time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m52s)

[uh and probably here too there's too](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m54s)

[many too many unit tests in here in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h47m57s)

[talk ottoman I did I I joked that I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m00s)

[wasn't going to use the word unit test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m01s)

[and then I used it like four times](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m02s)

[uh how do you ensure the tests are good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m05s)

[tests bad tests provide nearly no value](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m06s)

[and are just a hassle to maintain I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m08s)

[would actually argue that bad tests are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m11s)

[not nearly no value that they are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m14s)

[negative value](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m19s)

[yeah the one of the one of the earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m21s)

[slides in the presentation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m23s)

[um the the comment that artem and I made](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m26s)

[our tests are not free](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m28s)

[right some people get this idea of well](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m31s)

[I wrote the test now I'm done uh no like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m33s)

[if you could write code and be done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m37s)

[developers would be out of a job right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m39s)

[code constantly is evolving and if your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m41s)

[code is evolving your tests need to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m44s)

[evolve to right simple as that like if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m46s)

[you've got requirements that are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m48s)

[changing and moving your code needs to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m49s)

[constantly be moving and changing to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m52s)

[come in line with whatever those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m54s)

[changing requirements are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m55s)

[um but on to the actual practical idea](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h48m59s)

[of of how do you know tests are good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m01s)

[good tests so the the first and simplest](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m04s)

[thing to do especially in.net is check](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m08s)

[code coverage metrics](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m11s)

[um a phrase that I've repeated many](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m13s)

[times is that code coverage is a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m14s)

[negative metric](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m17s)

[it cannot tell you what code is covered](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m19s)

[despite its name which is really](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m22s)

[unfortunate they call it code coverage](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m24s)

[and it really doesn't tell you what code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m26s)

[is covered by a test it just tells you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m29s)

[what code was executed by a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m31s)

[and maybe I'm being a little pedantic on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m34s)

[the word cover but whatever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m35s)

[um what it is very good at identifying](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m37s)

[is what code is not tested](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m40s)

[code coverage reports are really good at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m43s)

[telling you what code you have not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m45s)

[tested](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m47s)

[so the the first thing to know if it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m48s)

[a if your tests are good is check to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m51s)

[make sure that you don't have any gaps](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m55s)

[right look for those uncovered bits in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h49m58s)

[your code coverage report is the first](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m01s)

[is the first way right because if you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m03s)

[if your stuff is not covered by the test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m05s)

[you you your code is your code is crap](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m09s)

[the other thing that I that I often do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m11s)

[is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m14s)

[um I look at churn on the unit test a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m16s)

[little bit as well](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m20s)

[and there's there's some pluses and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m21s)

[minuses of this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m23s)

[um artem said it really well is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m24s)

[sometimes people get really unhappy when](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m26s)

[they're like uh I made a change in my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m28s)

[code and now I have to go update you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m31s)

[know 80 tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m33s)

[um and and artem made the comment that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m36s)

[you know people often look at that as a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m38s)

[negative but that is probably the wrong](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m40s)

[mentality of the test right if you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m43s)

[making a change and it's going to force](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m45s)

[you to go and update a huge number of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m48s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m49s)

[it's probably worth stopping and asking](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m51s)

[yourself the question of did you make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m53s)

[the change in the right place](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m56s)

[right maybe it's legitimate and you you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h50m59s)

[changed a method that ha that has a ton](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m02s)

[of tests over it so therefore you need](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m04s)

[to right that's possible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m06s)

[um but it's also worth asking the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m08s)

[question of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m10s)

[maybe you should question like if you're](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m11s)

[if your simple change is going to have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m14s)

[all these far-reaching effects over your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m16s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m18s)

[maybe you should question if that's the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m19s)

[right place to the change right maybe](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m22s)

[it's wrong](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m24s)

[um because your tests are one of the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m26s)

[first areas where you get to understand](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m28s)

[the ramifications of your change](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m29s)

[like if you have a test Suite that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m32s)

[covers all of the requirements of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m34s)

[code base](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m37s)

[if you make a change and you see a test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m39s)

[fail](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m42s)

[like resist the urge to just go and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m43s)

[tweak the assertion so that the test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m45s)

[passes that's bad but the but it can be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m46s)

[quite helpful to say oh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m51s)

[I didn't realize if I you know tweaked](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m53s)

[this thing here that it's going to break](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m56s)

[this other feature over here you know we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h51m57s)

[didn't think through the the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m00s)

[implications of those changes right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m01s)

[that's the ideal situation right if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m03s)

[you're if your tests are capturing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m06s)

[requirements not implementation but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m08s)

[requirements if you make a change to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m10s)

[make you know your new test pass but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m13s)

[another one starts failing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m16s)

[it quickly can point out hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m18s)

[we've got requirements that are in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m21s)

[Conflict now right and that's that's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m23s)

[sweet spot when you have tests that are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m25s)

[that are catching](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m28s)

[um issues with your requirements and you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m30s)

[can go back to you know the the team or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m32s)

[whoever's putting together these things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m34s)

[and say hey look we've got these](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m36s)

[requirements that you know I know you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m38s)

[asked me for new feature X but you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m39s)

[realize what that's going to do to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m42s)

[feature y that we did last month right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m43s)

[how do you expect these things to work](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m45s)

[together right and you can start having](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m47s)

[that dialogue That's The Sweet Spot like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m49s)

[nah](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m54s)

[so I would say if if the tests are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m55s)

[becoming a burden look at the question](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h52m58s)

[whether your implementation's right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m00s)

[first and then consider the test the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m02s)

[other thing to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m04s)

[to keep a lookout for there are a couple](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m06s)

[red flags for bad unit tests that that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m08s)

[always perk me up when I see them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m12s)

[um one the so first the name if I can't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m15s)

[read the test name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m20s)

[and know what's being tested just from](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m22s)

[your your test name](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m24s)

[it's probably a bad test at minimum one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m26s)

[that needs to be renamed](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m29s)

[because the the name should drive what I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m30s)

[see in the rest uh what I see in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m34s)

[rest of the body of the test the other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m36s)

[thing that is often nice to do and I I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m38s)

[will often do this when doing code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m40s)

[reviews is because we always name our](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m42s)

[test project with DOT test on the end](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m45s)

[which unfortunately means alphabetically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m46s)

[they get put at the end of the list I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m48s)

[will often re do pull request reviews](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m50s)

[from bottom up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m52s)

[so that I'm reading the tests first and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m54s)

[then going and looking at the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m57s)

[implementations right rather than](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m58s)

[starting from the top down and reading](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h53m59s)

[if your things are named with DOT test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m06s)

[on the end it means you'll be looking at](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m08s)

[the test before the implementation and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m09s)

[so reading through tests trying to block](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m11s)

[out the idea of what I know the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m15s)

[implementation would be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m17s)

[as a reviewer I have that nice](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m19s)

[perspective the author doesn't get that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m21s)

[perspective because they already have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m23s)

[some preconceived notions in their head](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m25s)

[of either what they were going to write](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m26s)

[or what they did write either way once](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m28s)

[they've seen it you can't unsee it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m30s)

[um so being able to look at it from from](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m33s)

[that perspective](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m35s)

[um I would also propose that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m41s)

[there it is worth adding some tools to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m42s)

[your toolbox and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m45s)

[um I may try to con artem into doing a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m47s)

[few more of these talks around](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m50s)

[testing tools and application of them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m53s)

[because there's so many good things out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m55s)

[there that are worth knowing about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h54m57s)

[probably fine like that's a that's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m07s)

[good first step but there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m08s)

[things that you can throw on top of that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m10s)

[I mentioned approval tests earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m11s)

[especially when you have deep object](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m13s)

[graphs like knowing when to use an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m15s)

[approval test can save you a ton of time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m16s)

[if I see a test with 40 assertions in it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m19s)

[I start going dear heavens](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m21s)

[what's going on right like why are there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m24s)

[so many assertions and oftentimes the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m26s)

[answer is there's a deep object model](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m28s)

[that they're trying to validate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m30s)

[okay we should we should talk about ways](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m32s)

[of validating a deep object model right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m34s)

[customer quality Compares approval tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m37s)

[both of those better options right makes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m40s)

[it a lot easier to track down what's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m42s)

[different between two different things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m45s)

[especially if you need something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m48s)

[where you where you're kind of hyper](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m49s)

[specific of I want to test these things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m51s)

[I don't care about the whole object but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m53s)

[I care about most of it right that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m54s)

[always the hard one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m56s)

[um there are different things like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m58s)

[looking at different assertion libraries](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h55m59s)

[um some people really like the fluent](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m02s)

[assertions Library which does start to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m04s)

[give you some of those nicer](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m06s)

[um deeper uh comparisons between types](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m09s)

[though it doesn't give you the same diff](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m11s)

[view on the failure that an approval](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m14s)

[test would give you things like mock or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m15s)

[automocker I leverage a lot specifically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m19s)

[for decoupling my tests from The](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m22s)

[Constructor because if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m25s)

[if you aren't using something like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m27s)

[automocker to create the thing that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m30s)

[you're testing what ends up happening is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m32s)

[as soon as you add a dependency](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m34s)

[I think I have a sample of this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m36s)

[okay I have a sample](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m39s)

[yeah so something like this](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m41s)

[you'll note in this case I am just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m43s)

[testing my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m46s)

[uh so in this case I am testing the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m48s)

[increment counter command](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m51s)

[I am testing this execute method and I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m53s)

[expect that it increments the count](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m55s)

[right and I'm in I'm already inside of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h56m58s)

[main window view model test so I try not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m00s)

[to repeat main window view model in the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m01s)

[test name because it's already there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m04s)

[but the idea being that it goes through](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m07s)

[it grabs the initial count it executes](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m09s)

[the command verifies that the count was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m11s)

[incremented by one](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m13s)

[simple but you'll note here nowhere am I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m15s)

[actually calling the Constructor of main](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m19s)

[window view model the idea being that if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m21s)

[I if I need to add a Constructor](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m23s)

[dependency right maybe I add in an i](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m26s)

[dispatcher here hypothetically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m29s)

[right it's now my automarker has now](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m31s)

[decoupled my test from The Constructor](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m34s)

[and I only need to care about those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m36s)

[Constructor dependencies that that are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m38s)

[being exercised as part of this test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m42s)

[right so things like that can save you a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m45s)

[lot of headache](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m47s)

[for uh major refactors as well the other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m48s)

[thing even if you don't like using](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m52s)

[automocker](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m54s)

[don't have your Constructor invocation](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m56s)

[in every single one of your tests right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h57m59s)

[that's a great example of an easy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m01s)

[refactor uh just you know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m03s)

[private static main window view model](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m06s)

[create right and you can even make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m10s)

[create take parameters so if you don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m13s)

[use automarker have the creation of your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m15s)

[system under test in a shared method](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m18s)

[that way if the Constructor changes you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m21s)

[don't update 40 tests right you update](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m23s)

[one thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m27s)

[and you're done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m29s)

[and it's easy and your life doesn't suck](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m30s)

[right so simply refactoring those types](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m33s)

[of things out can save you a lot of pain](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m36s)

[and suffering](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m39s)

[right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m40s)

[um so aggressive aggressive refactoring](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m42s)

[of your tests are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m46s)

[diff so especially if things are saying](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m48s)

[a half if your tests are a hassle to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m51s)

[maintain aggressively refactor them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m53s)

[um because the test project is one of](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h58m57s)

[the areas because it's not shipping and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m00s)

[I don't want to give the idea that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m02s)

[somehow the test project is less](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m03s)

[important than whatever you ship right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m05s)

[but rarely do we ship our test projects](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m07s)

[which means the the usual guidance that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m10s)

[people would give on Legacy code bases](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m13s)

[of you know be careful don't Don't Touch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m15s)

[Too Much you don't want to break](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m16s)

[anything those rules generally don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m18s)

[apply to your test projects Break Stuff](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m20s)

[refactor aggressively refactor your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m23s)

[tests so that they aren't a hassle to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m26s)

[maintain that that type of refactoring](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m28s)

[pays dividends I love building](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m31s)

[um static factories and there are other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m35s)

[libraries around what is the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m38s)

[not Auto fact](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m40s)

[dude I'm blanking on the library there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m43s)

[there's libraries around doing Factory](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m45s)

[methods for creating objects up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m47s)

[um with test data pre-populated and all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m50s)

[the properties](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m52s)

[do that and again if you don't want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m54s)

[if you if you can't use a nuget package](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m56s)

[or you don't want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=01h59m58s)

[static methods right they work great](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m00s)

[um if you've got some some class that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m04s)

[you have to create with test data for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m06s)

[multiple tests wrap that up in a in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m08s)

[factory method somewhere like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m11s)

[aggressively refactor](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m12s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m18s)

[okay and I think this is the last one we](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m20s)

[have here what are some general uh rules](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m21s)

[of thumb to be uh regarding what should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m25s)

[be automated tested versus what should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m28s)

[be UI tested specifically around desktop](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m30s)

[apps](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m32s)

[okay so the first one that comes to mind](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m38s)

[is and what I mentioned earlier about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m40s)

[if if the requirement is capturable is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m46s)

[easily tested right if it's something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m50s)

[that's objectively easy to capture in a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m54s)

[test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m58s)

[it should probably be tested now where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h00m58s)

[it should be tested is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m01s)

[always a bit of a uh a question so I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m04s)

[would let's see where is it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m10s)

[I would push for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m12s)

[it should be tested as far left on the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m14s)

[Spectrum as is reasonable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m17s)

[not not necessarily as possible but as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m20s)

[reasonable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m24s)

[right like I can take like I can I can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m25s)

[do things with like WPF fact and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m29s)

[threading and I can make my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m31s)

[my WPF user control behave in a unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m34s)

[test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m38s)

[that's probably not the the right way to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m39s)

[to to test the control right because I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m42s)

[have to then make sure I'm calling the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m46s)

[the layout and the measure calls to make](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m48s)

[sure that all of the right events are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m50s)

[occurring and that kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m52s)

[it should be tested as far left as is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m55s)

[reasonable depending on what it is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h01m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m02s)

[for UI testing hang on I stole a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m03s)

[stolen answer from a colleague earlier](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m08s)

[it's okay I told him I was going to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m10s)

[steal his answer so this is acceptable](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m12s)

[um also thank you Mike](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m15s)

[um since you said you're going to watch](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m17s)

[the recording later hi uh so shout out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m19s)

[to Mike because he is tester](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m22s)

[extraordinaire and I will happily good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m27s)

[so specifically around desktop apps](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m28s)

[um he calls out that if it's if it's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m33s)

[possible to to design around it so that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m35s)

[you don't need to UI test it and you can](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m38s)

[shift it left please do that first that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m40s)

[is that is usual because with everything](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m42s)

[on the the testing Spectrum the further](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m45s)

[to the right you get](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m48s)

[the cost of of building and maintaining](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m49s)

[that test goes up as well as the run](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m52s)

[time of that test goes up as you'll note](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m54s)

[on my graph I focused around](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h02m57s)

[the time it takes to actually run that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m00s)

[test right compilers fast](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m02s)

[seconds maybe less right your unit tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m05s)

[also seconds should be slower test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m09s)

[minutes right maybe maybe push in an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m12s)

[hour or something but like most](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m15s)

[like if you're using Azure devops or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m18s)

[GitHub your stuff is going to start](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m21s)

[timing out at the 60 Minute Mark so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m23s)

[you're probably in the minutes or so in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m25s)

[here you get over into the the manual](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m27s)

[testing Realm okay I I've seen people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m29s)

[actually have numbers that have the word](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m32s)

[weeks following them](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m34s)

[right and then end user testing is as](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m36s)

[long as your release is live](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m40s)

[so when possible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m43s)

[refactor to move it left preferably all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m45s)

[the way in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m48s)

[um for UI tests the the idea should be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m49s)

[to hit the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m53s)

[um the the critical paths](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m55s)

[as concisely as possible](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h03m57s)

[so you don't need on for UI testing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m01s)

[stuff you don't need to hit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m04s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m06s)

[right you need to hit the critical paths](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m08s)

[to make sure that the app is in a good](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m10s)

[functional State and that features are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m13s)

[working](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m16s)

[right unlike unit tests where the goal](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m16s)

[is to get a wide breadth of testing and](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m19s)

[make sure you've hit all the specific](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m22s)

[scenarios](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m23s)

[in an ideal situation UI tests are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m25s)

[written from the perspective of unit](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m27s)

[tests are already there so we know the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m30s)

[individual pieces work now we're just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m32s)

[validating that the pieces work together](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m35s)

[right you don't need to dep you don't](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m37s)

[need to replicate](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m39s)

[um testing that was already done at an](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m41s)

[earlier stage so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m44s)

[once you get up to the UI test level](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m46s)

[you're really just testing those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m48s)

[um connection bits the end flow things](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m51s)

[that weren't easily capturable in a in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m54s)

[an earlier test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m56s)

[uh let's see what else did he say here](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h04m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m02s)

[yeah uh he also commented that as much](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m04s)

[as possible he tries to get it to where](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m09s)

[when you get down to manual UI testing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m10s)

[I.E the monkey clicking of the QA people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m13s)

[that ideally what you want](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m15s)

[um them doing is exploratory testing so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m19s)

[uh looking for things that may or may](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m23s)

[not be covered by tests you don't want](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m25s)

[your](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m28s)

[um Q8 people wasting their time on the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m29s)

[well-trodden path](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m32s)

[that you should have already captured in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m33s)

[your test you want them poking at Edge](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m35s)

[conditions things that you may have not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m38s)

[thought to test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m40s)

[right you want them looking for other](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m41s)

[areas that that may or may not be there](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m44s)

[and then it's all about finding](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m49s)

[all about finding what are those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m51s)

[critical paths](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m53s)

[and getting those automated first](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m55s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h05m58s)

[yeah so I think on this one shift left](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m00s)

[is is preferable for UI testing getting](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m02s)

[the critical code paths](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m07s)

[um and to some degree depending on how](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m09s)

[you structure stuff you can kind of cut](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m11s)

[some stuff off with integration or](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m13s)

[functional tests of okay now we're going](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m15s)

[to put some pieces together and see how](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m17s)

[they play](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m18s)

[with each other and make sure that they](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m19s)

[work](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m23s)

[and again as you shift as you move right](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m24s)

[along that Spectrum](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m27s)

[try to avoid rehashing tests that were](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m29s)

[already previously done](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m36s)

[yeah happy path test should be done by](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m37s)

[devs before done yes absolutely](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m39s)

[absolutely I actually even advocate for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m41s)

[some some places have the tests written](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m45s)

[by by QA or somebody other than the devs](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m48s)

[um I don't like that I think Dev should](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m52s)

[be responsible for writing all their](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m54s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m56s)

[whether that be UI unit whatever](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h06m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m01s)

[and not saying that QA can't write more](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m01s)

[tests like that absolutely should be](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m04s)

[done like in an ideal situation if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m06s)

[you've got technical QA people who are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m09s)

[capable of writing tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m13s)

[they should try to like they know their](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m13s)

[their hot paths that they go down](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m17s)

[they should try to automate their hot](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m19s)

[path](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m23s)

[so but then having devs right there that](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m25s)

[first round of tests devs write code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m27s)

[differently when they're throwing the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m30s)

[code over the fence to somebody else to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m33s)

[bug test](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m34s)

[right it's really easy to go nah that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m36s)

[qa's problem we're gonna make them do it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m38s)

[like if that's the setup](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m40s)

[it allows that that then allows a people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m43s)

[problem to creep in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m46s)

[right and you can't completely solve](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m48s)

[that by saying okay devs are going to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m50s)

[write tests because that usually just](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m52s)

[means then the lazy Dev writes lazy](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m53s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m55s)

[um there's there's probably a people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m57s)

[solution that needs to go in](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h07m59s)

[um and address that as well](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m01s)

[but having the devs actually build out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m04s)

[tests for that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m07s)

[like you write code differently when you](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m09s)

[know that it's there I actually heard](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m11s)

[about](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m13s)

[um some situations I think it was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m15s)

[Microsoft where devs were on the hook](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m16s)

[for any any bug that was found in their](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m20s)

[code they were on the hook for even if](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m22s)

[they had changed teams](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m25s)

[and not surprisingly the number of bugs](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m28s)

[found in production dropped dramatically](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m31s)

[like if you know that your phone is](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m33s)

[going to ring at 2 am if somebody finds](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m35s)

[a bug in your code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m37s)

[you darn well make sure your code is bug](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m39s)

[free because you don't want to be the](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m42s)

[one woken up at 2 am](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m44s)

[so if you ship something and there's a](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m45s)

[bug in it they call and wake you up](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m47s)

[and I'm like oh that's a great way to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m50s)

[get rid of bugs make sure people have](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m53s)

[ownership in the stuff that they ship](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m55s)

[it's not like well I wrote it that's](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m57s)

[qa's problem they didn't find the bug](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h08m59s)

[not my fault it's like no that's not how](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m00s)

[this works that is not how this works](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m04s)

[okay I think that may have been the last](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m08s)

[one that I had on here yeah and the end](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m10s)

[of end of PowerPoint deck](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m15s)

[okay so I think that was everything I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m17s)

[was planning on going through tonight I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m19s)

[realize it's a little different than my](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m21s)

[usual coding stream but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m23s)

[I got so much feedback on the talk](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m25s)

[earlier this week I kind of felt like it](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m27s)

[was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m29s)

[it was probably going to be something](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m30s)

[worth having a discussion on and having](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m31s)

[more videos like I said if people are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m33s)

[interested in seeing](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m35s)

[that Hands-On style of thing of hey](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m38s)

[let's look at some tips and tricks for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m41s)

[practically writing code](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m44s)

[um for some of the testing situations](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m47s)

[um let me know because I'd be happy to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m50s)

[do that again I think it's one of those](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m52s)

[that in my opinion that's the easy part](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m54s)

[of testing right showing somebody](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h09m57s)

[like](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m00s)

[how to write the test getting somebody](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m01s)

[in the mental state that they want to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m03s)

[start with the test that's what I've](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m05s)

[always seen as being the hard part so](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m07s)

[because that's the people problem not](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m10s)

[the technical problem technical problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m12s)

[I can solve that's easy I I can teach](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m14s)

[you testing Frameworks and tools and all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m17s)

[of that jazz that's not a problem but](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m19s)

[the the mental shift of deciding okay I](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m21s)

[want to write tests I want to build](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m25s)

[these out](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m26s)

[um I think those are](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m28s)

[those are the important part for people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m30s)

[to get into](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m32s)

[oh Justin Bieber no problem](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m33s)

[always happy to](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m35s)

[so yeah like I said if people if people](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m36s)

[like this and want to see some practical](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m39s)

[application ones let me know](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m40s)

[I may try to con artiman to doing stuff](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m43s)

[with me he loves testing as much as I do](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m45s)

[so it's it's usually easy for a nerd](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m48s)

[snipe so yeah blue spider thanks for](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m50s)

[coming and hanging out I appreciate all](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m53s)

[the questions and feedback too that was](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m54s)

[great](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m56s)

[so I think with that I'll tell everybody](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h10m58s)

[thanks for coming happy coding see](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h11m00s)

[everyone next time](https://youtu.be/VVBqmoAexFU?t=02h11m03s)
