[i'm gonna dive back into a little bit of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m05s)

[the material design and xaml work i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m07s)

[would like to try and get a release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m09s)

[stream for the github actions work uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m18s)

[the only thing that's really remaining](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m20s)

[on the github actions is to add in one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m22s)

[more](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m23s)

[uh bit that will do an actual full](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m24s)

[publish rather than a preview nuget](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m26s)

[package but the fact that we can get](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m28s)

[excuse me uh the fact we can get preview](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m31s)

[nuget packages all the way up to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m33s)

[nougat.org means that there should be no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m34s)

[issue there it's just a matter of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m36s)

[getting all the bits wired up so i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m37s)

[figured tonight i would look at the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m39s)

[remaining issues since there's one in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m41s)

[particular with the combo box that is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m42s)

[just notorious and will not die but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m46s)

[before we get to that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m48s)

[seen this before uh i'm in spokane](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m57s)

[washington this is the local.net group](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h00m59s)

[uh not surprising i like to participate](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m03s)

[14th my boss mark michaelis and i are](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m09s)

[going to be talking about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m11s)

[nullable reference types in c sharp so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m12s)

[that's a fairly new feature if you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m14s)

[aren't familiar with it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m15s)

[it's going to pretty much be a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m17s)

[everything you need to know from xero to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m19s)

[up and running so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m22s)

[a lot of it is fairly simple and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m23s)

[straightforward but there are a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m25s)

[some gotchas with it especially if you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m27s)

[aren't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m29s)

[overly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m30s)

[familiar with that feature so if you are](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m31s)

[interested at all feel free both of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m34s)

[these events by the way are free and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m35s)

[available both in person and online](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m38s)

[so if you're interested go ahead and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m40s)

[sign up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m42s)

[the next one um just got posted earlier](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m43s)

[today and is actually um a week or i'm](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m46s)

[sorry a month out so it's not going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m49s)

[be september it's going to be october](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m52s)

[um c sharp calamity so this is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m58s)

[my way of trying to teach some c sharp](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h01m59s)

[features in a we'll call it entertaining](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m02s)

[and fun manner so i wrote arguably the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m04s)

[worst code i have ever written my entire](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m06s)

[life](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m08s)

[which was a fun challenge to try and see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m09s)

[what levels of crazy could be achieved](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m11s)

[when you really set your mind to it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m14s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m17s)

[i tried to write as very simple as](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m18s)

[possible but the the intent of it is to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m20s)

[kind of peel back the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m22s)

[the absurdity of it all and use that as](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m24s)

[a means to actually understand various](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m27s)

[c-sharp compiler features and how they](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m29s)

[work so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m31s)

[that will be that there if either of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m32s)

[those sound interesting to you go ahead](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m34s)

[and sign up like i said both in person](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m36s)

[and online so if you aren't local by all](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m38s)

[means](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m40s)

[they will also show up on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m41s)

[intellitech](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m44s)

[let's see youtube](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m46s)

[on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m48s)

[this youtube channel](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m49s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m52s)

[they will get posted here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m53s)

[at some point after they are done](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m56s)

[so we we were working on getting the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h02m58s)

[av setup forum rolling today so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m01s)

[hopefully we get good nice](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m04s)

[better looking recordings](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m07s)

[okay with that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m10s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m11s)

[material design example let's let's go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m13s)

[that direction okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m15s)

[there are a few to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m17s)

[and maybe we may we start with the pull](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m20s)

[requests](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m21s)

[so this guy here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m23s)

[ah so there is one thing that's really](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m26s)

[interesting to me and i don't know quite](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m29s)

[how to solve it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m32s)

[you'll note that this pull request has](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m33s)

[zero checks on it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m36s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m38s)

[due to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m39s)

[this pull request has one check on it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m42s)

[where it runs the pull request](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m46s)

[validation](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m47s)

[the reason here is with github actions](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m48s)

[there is a a limitation in that a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m51s)

[something done by a github action](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m55s)

[cannot](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m58s)

[uh recursively trigger another action](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h03m59s)

[which can be a bit of a a problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m02s)

[because i've got one action and if we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m04s)

[look over here just dive over here and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m06s)

[look](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m08s)

[so this icon update this is the one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m09s)

[that's ultimately generating those pull](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m11s)

[requests](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m13s)

[so every night](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m14s)

[this thing goes off to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m16s)

[materialdesignicons.net downloads the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m20s)

[latest icons and if there's any updates](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m22s)

[opens a pull request to bring them into](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m25s)

[the library that way the library stays](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m26s)

[up to date you know i'm never more than](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m28s)

[24 hours out of date or](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m29s)

[a little bit more depends on what i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m31s)

[merged the pull request but it keeps the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m32s)

[icons fresh and we don't have this issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m35s)

[of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m37s)

[uh hey you know i see this on the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m38s)

[website but i don't see in the library](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m39s)

[yeah that's gone which is great that's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m41s)

[exactly what we want](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m43s)

[but because this pull request was](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m45s)

[triggered by an action](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m48s)

[the action to validate pull requests is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m50s)

[not triggered](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m52s)

[i'm kind of okay with it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m56s)

[if this ever does cause a problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h04m58s)

[it will get um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m00s)

[it'll get automatically picked up at the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m03s)

[point](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m05s)

[that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m06s)

[um the merge occurs because this one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m07s)

[once the merge occurs into the master](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m11s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m12s)

[will trigger so there's that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m13s)

[okay let's start with getting some of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m16s)

[these other ones because there are some](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m17s)

[good](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m19s)

[fixes in here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m20s)

[and we will check these out so this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m22s)

[issue here and i don't think i moved it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m24s)

[yet so let's get this issue into the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m27s)

[milestone](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m29s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m34s)

[so this here is following this feature](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m36s)

[date picker seems to be missing the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m40s)

[header and background](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m42s)

[oh that's a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m45s)

[that's a fun bug](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m47s)

[had a background header foreground](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m53s)

[that cleans that up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h05m58s)

[oh so it was just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m00s)

[uh oh because there was a second](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m06s)

[a second style i'm a little curious as](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m11s)

[to how this fixes it let's check this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m13s)

[pull request out real quick](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m15s)

[we're gonna come over here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m18s)

[everybody's favorite get kraken uh let's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m21s)

[see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m24s)

[i don't know why i have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m26s)

[that installed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m28s)

[it's a great tool but not for this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m30s)

[project we do not need it here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m32s)

[let's pull this guy up and get him on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m34s)

[the latest okay so pull request so we're](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m36s)

[gonna come in here and let's just do uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m38s)

[check out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m42s)

[and how about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m43s)

[calendar boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m46s)

[so this guy here and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m50s)

[that's not the project i want i would](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m54s)

[like this project](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m56s)

[so i this doesn't look bad and i i like](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h06m59s)

[that this adds in a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m02s)

[another option into](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m04s)

[the demo app to help make it easier but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m08s)

[i am wondering if there should be a ui](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m10s)

[test on this as well](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m12s)

[we shall see we shall see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m14s)

[okay so step one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m17s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m20s)

[let's launch this guy up and just go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m22s)

[look at that demo app bit to make sure](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m23s)

[that it does in fact do as we expect](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m25s)

[come on compile i know we just reset our](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m38s)

[we just set our branch pointer way back](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m41s)

[to here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m45s)

[work in progress on group box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m46s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m48s)

[what i was doing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m52s)

[oh and pipeline work is now dead so we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m53s)

[can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h07m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m26s)

[if you are like me and you keep track of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m27s)

[a whole bunch of remotes in here and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m29s)

[oftentimes just mark them as not visible](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m31s)

[get cracking sometimes gets very very](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m34s)

[confused](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m37s)

[so that's exciting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m39s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m41s)

[that should be better](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m42s)

[reload](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m44s)

[and then we can go through and try this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m47s)

[all i want to do is see this thing work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m49s)

[i i now feel better for not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m53s)

[seeing the picker](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m55s)

[it's like the change was very simple it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h13m58s)

[was add a picker to the demo app](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m00s)

[more importantly it should have a hint](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m04s)

[of custom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m06s)

[and it should be right after the first](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m08s)

[one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m10s)

[between number one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m10s)

[and number two](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m12s)

[should not be hard come on visual studio](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m15s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m24s)

[do we have a compiler what are you doing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m28s)

[why did i just fail to hit the button](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m34s)

[compile](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m37s)

[should not be hard](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m41s)

[the pipeline passed so the code should](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m43s)

[be good](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m45s)

[at least good enough to compile okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m47s)

[let's take a look here this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m50s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m57s)

[that's what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h14m58s)

[perfect see that shows the header shows](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m01s)

[the color](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m04s)

[we check here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m05s)

[we can see that this guy here is set up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m07s)

[with a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m09s)

[a little a lot of styles but the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m11s)

[important part is this actually shows](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m13s)

[um some of the extra settings that can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m16s)

[be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m18s)

[spot check on the rest of these to make](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m28s)

[sure these actually look correct](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m29s)

[which that one i believe is supposed to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m33s)

[easy proof](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m48s)

[let's go take a look at the other one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m55s)

[and then we'll go back to the combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m57s)

[paper variant group boxes oh was this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h15m59s)

[one ever](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m01s)

[i need to circle back on this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m04s)

[okay i need to circle back on this and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m14s)

[see where we're at on this one this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m16s)

[one's been a little bit of back and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m18s)

[forth okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m19s)

[okay so abandoning all that let's go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m20s)

[here so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m22s)

[um let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m30s)

[didn't we just resolve this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m33s)

[oh yeah uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m37s)

[this is now so this was a bug](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m40s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m44s)

[closed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m46s)

[that's done](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h16m49s)

[sorry one second](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m04s)

[okay issues milestone](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m07s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m11s)

[one of these two but i think this one's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m13s)

[probably easiest](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m14s)

[okay so release works well when hit test](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m16s)

[visible falls for items presenter and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m19s)

[i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m22s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m22s)

[this part](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m25s)

[and i mark this as a valuation required](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m26s)

[do not work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m31s)

[as expected with this xaml code and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m33s)

[ignore the hit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m35s)

[test visible so what is going on here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m37s)

[i'm going to edit this real quick so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m42s)

[pro tip when doing markdown](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m44s)

[three ticks will let you do a code block](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m47s)

[rather than inline code](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m50s)

[and actually we can go one step further](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m54s)

[if i go edit and go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m55s)

[xaml we'll get some](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h17m58s)

[friendlier highlighting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m00s)

[okay so that's a little easier to read](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m02s)

[so what we've got here is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m04s)

[a control template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m08s)

[with a border and a scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m14s)

[an items presenter with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m21s)

[hit test visible falls](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m23s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m34s)

[a couple thoughts that i have just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m35s)

[reading this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m37s)

[is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m38s)

[the a control template like this is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m40s)

[going to override the material design](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m42s)

[control pla template so the issue would](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m44s)

[not be inside of the data grid template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m46s)

[directly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m48s)

[because this here will completely](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m49s)

[the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m57s)

[the scroll viewer here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h18m59s)

[is a potential issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m03s)

[in that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m07s)

[these ones could be picking up implicit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m09s)

[templates](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m12s)

[the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m17s)

[interesting part to me is this comment](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m18s)

[about how this part is not working](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m24s)

[so i think what i'm going to do is i'm](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m30s)

[going to actually spin](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m32s)

[a quick project in my examples repo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m33s)

[and we'll take a look at it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m37s)

[because i i want to be able to spin this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m47s)

[at the exact version of the library](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m48s)

[that the issue references](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m51s)

[apparently i've got some](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m53s)

[outstanding changes whatever okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m55s)

[let's start here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h19m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m01s)

[this will be fine we'll just we'll just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m04s)

[pick on one of these so manage nuget](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m05s)

[packages and i want to get](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m07s)

[i want to get the same version that's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m10s)

[referenced here so they said](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m12s)

[00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,080](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m15s)

[Music]

[so let's start there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m23s)

[oh i have an update i haven't updated a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m26s)

[lot of my libraries](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m28s)

[i've thought about trying to go through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m30s)

[and keep my examples up to date with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m32s)

[latest material design ones and then i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m34s)

[realized sometimes it's actually kind of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m36s)

[handy to be able to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m38s)

[to not do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m41s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m44s)

[four one o](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m46s)

[two five five six](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m48s)

[it's interesting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m51s)

[current public release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m55s)

[this is not the public release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h20m59s)

[i have so i'm assuming though](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m07s)

[and we'll double check here in just a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m11s)

[minute but i'm guessing the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m12s)

[so with the way that the the azure](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m14s)

[devops pipeline was working](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m16s)

[is it would take the same build that the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m18s)

[preview was done with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m21s)

[and just change the nuget version so i'm](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m22s)

[guessing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m25s)

[that is gonna if i look at the um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m27s)

[assembly version](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m30s)

[that's what it's going to have on there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m32s)

[so we'll we'll update it and we can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m34s)

[confirm that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m41s)

[what is your problem here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m44s)

[uh iproject remote](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m47s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m51s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m53s)

[output that is not the bug](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h21m56s)

[update](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m04s)

[trust me you can do this update](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m07s)

[i promise](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m10s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m15s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m17s)

[i've just lost patience for this project](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m18s)

[and moving right along](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m20s)

[let's find one that's updated a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m22s)

[newer so specifically looking for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m24s)

[something that isn't using the old](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m27s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m29s)

[style stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m31s)

[don't want to see packages](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m34s)

[you will work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m38s)

[manage nuget packages](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m41s)

[actually i probably don't even need to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m51s)

[do that i'm a little surprised that wow](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m52s)

[okay some of you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h22m58s)

[so this guy here we can actually whack](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m01s)

[that and we can just go with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m03s)

[4.1.0](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m07s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m10s)

[go and load yourself](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m12s)

[you should figure it out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m14s)

[that should load that up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m16s)

[that should pick up the colors theme](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m18s)

[great okay now that everybody's happy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m21s)

[about that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m23s)

[let's come over here and let's powwow](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m24s)

[with the data grid](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m26s)

[real quick before i get too carried away](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m28s)

[set a startup okay so that cleans that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m31s)

[up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m34s)

[uh oh we were doing data grid not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m36s)

[dialogue post oops well doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m37s)

[we're gonna whack everything anyway](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m41s)

[day to grid](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m43s)

[and then let's do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m48s)

[let's just grab this whole little bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m51s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m53s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m54s)

[data grid uh template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h23m58s)

[we're just gonna inline this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m01s)

[scroll viewer template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m05s)

[this will be a little hard to know](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m11s)

[exactly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m13s)

[what that was what are you unhappy about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m15s)

[oh it's missing that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m18s)

[let's clean that up real quick](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m22s)

[because that is clearly just missing the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m26s)

[slash there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m28s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m30s)

[data grid and maybe i really should have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m33s)

[picked on a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m35s)

[i saw a ds and got a little carried away](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m37s)

[yeah let's go pick on this one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m44s)

[because this is already wired up for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m47s)

[data](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m48s)

[okay but we are going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m51s)

[just steal this little bit of work that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m54s)

[not a lot of work but we'll steal a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m56s)

[little bit of it set a startup project](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h24m58s)

[main window and let's come over here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m01s)

[so we're just going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m06s)

[whatever that's doing because we don't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m07s)

[want it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m11s)

[sure we can leave that there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m13s)

[can leave all of you there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m15s)

[and we can put you there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m18s)

[and we can clean up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m22s)

[hang on hang on i'll clean it up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m25s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m31s)

[so is hit test visible so for anybody](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m39s)

[who may not be familiar with that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m41s)

[property inside of wpf hit test visible](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m42s)

[is all about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m46s)

[what is underneath my cursor](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m48s)

[so when](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m50s)

[you do things like click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m52s)

[the wpf system has to figure out okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m54s)

[what did you actually click on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m57s)

[because you've got all of these ui](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h25m59s)

[elements and they're they're laid out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m01s)

[but knowing which thing is directly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m03s)

[under your cursor as well as which](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m05s)

[things on top of that stack](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m07s)

[sometimes the ui element that's actually](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m10s)

[at the top of the stack isn't something](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m13s)

[that should be interacted with it should](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m14s)

[be the thing below it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m16s)

[you could imagine like the ripple](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m17s)

[control that we have in material design](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m19s)

[sometimes you don't want the ripple](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m21s)

[control to be directly interacted with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m23s)

[you want the button underneath it to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m25s)

[what actually receives that that click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m27s)

[excuse me so it's not too uncommon to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m30s)

[set hit test visible to false on items](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m33s)

[that aren't intended to be interacted](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m35s)

[with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m36s)

[this one's a little weird](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m37s)

[simply because of that but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m41s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m49s)

[that kind of looks like it works](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m58s)

[let me](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h26m59s)

[let me just confirm that those items are](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m05s)

[interactable without this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m07s)

[which i assume they would be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m12s)

[yep so now we can interact with the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m14s)

[items](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m17s)

[okay and then just one last thing to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m19s)

[confirm](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m21s)

[i want to test the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m23s)

[i want to confirm that the version of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m27s)

[that dll that is actually being used is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m29s)

[in fact](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m32s)

[let's see properties](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m34s)

[details](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m37s)

[4102556 so yes so that is current](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m39s)

[production release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m42s)

[what are these squiggles for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m45s)

[oh it's because i commented and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m51s)

[uncommented](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m53s)

[that should be like that okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h27m55s)

[um i'm afraid i'm going to need more](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m02s)

[information](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m07s)

[okay so we're going to come back here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m09s)

[able to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m14s)

[replicate the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m17s)

[problem only](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m20s)

[using that xaml snippet](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m22s)

[can't spell that's okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m27s)

[i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m34s)

[modified the example](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m35s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m38s)

[and we will leave a link to that sample](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m40s)

[project](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m44s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m45s)

[examples](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m48s)

[let's see data grid selected row](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m50s)

[so we'll link straight in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h28m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m00s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m01s)

[such that the main window.xml](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m03s)

[looks like this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m08s)

[we'll do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m11s)

[and then we will just grab the entire](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m12s)

[block of xaml](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m14s)

[so that's now enough information to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m20s)

[the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m24s)

[overridden](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m27s)

[template in place](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m29s)

[i am not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m31s)

[able to interact](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m33s)

[with the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m36s)

[data grid cells](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m38s)

[i believe is expected](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m42s)

[okay um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m49s)

[okay there so let's see comment and then](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m52s)

[we're gonna change labels](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m54s)

[from bug](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m56s)

[uh to wait on feedback](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h29m59s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m02s)

[and i'm going to take it out of the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m03s)

[milestone i put it in there because it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m04s)

[looked like it had been a regression](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m06s)

[but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m09s)

[that looks like it is not a regression](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m12s)

[in fact](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m14s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m18s)

[back to this ugly guy two three four oh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m19s)

[and i think this is the one where i had](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m22s)

[started on before](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m24s)

[okay so first of all we're going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m26s)

[reset master](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m30s)

[hard to that commit i'm going to start](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m32s)

[removing my remotes because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m34s)

[i've got too many of these things and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m36s)

[they are constantly biting me](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m41s)

[there okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m44s)

[that gets me there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m47s)

[oh one other thing i want to show off](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m49s)

[because i so i talked about this on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m51s)

[stream](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m54s)

[last week but i got it working and i was](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m55s)

[quite proud of it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m57s)

[so we're going to take a moment to show](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h30m59s)

[it off so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m00s)

[we had done the github actions last week](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m02s)

[where uh we had the the pull request](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m04s)

[validation and we had the night uh and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m07s)

[we had the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m09s)

[trying to remember how far i got we had](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m11s)

[the desire to have a nice nightly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m13s)

[release that kicked off on a schedule](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m15s)

[which that was easy enough to do the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m18s)

[hard part was i wanted to only actually](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m20s)

[kick that nightly release off](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m23s)

[in the event that there was a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m25s)

[a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m28s)

[see if i can change that a little bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m31s)

[uh and so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m33s)

[we got that working to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m34s)

[so nightly release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m37s)

[so i got a little clever](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m40s)

[so i have this job here that does a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m42s)

[check for changes and it has an output](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m44s)

[of has changed that's it very simple](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m47s)

[inside of here it does two things one it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m51s)

[has to do the checkout because if it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m53s)

[doesn't do the checkout](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m56s)

[the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m58s)

[agent running this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h31m59s)

[github action](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m00s)

[has no code has no repo there so you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m02s)

[need this to actually get the repo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m04s)

[um and then set the fetch depth to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m06s)

[zero](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m09s)

[just for speed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m11s)

[and then down here very similar to what](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m13s)

[i had shown before of what i was](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m15s)

[imagining doing pulling the hashes off](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m16s)

[of here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m18s)

[doing a comparison and then this one bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m19s)

[me a little bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m22s)

[is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m23s)

[the comparison](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m25s)

[here even though this is a straight up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m26s)

[bool and power shell](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m29s)

[once you start doing this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m31s)

[it converts itself to a string or at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m33s)

[least that was the behavior i saw](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m35s)

[but this then sets the output of has](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m37s)

[changed to either upper or lower case](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m40s)

[true or false](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m42s)

[which goes here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m44s)

[this is a job starting on 17 all the way](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m46s)

[through here and you'll note there's a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m48s)

[second job called build](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m50s)

[first of all it has a need set on it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m52s)

[which is a dependency so this job can't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m54s)

[run until after a check for changes has](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m57s)

[run which is great because you could](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h32m59s)

[have a bunch of jobs and like execute](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m01s)

[stuff in parallel so you have to be able](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m02s)

[to build a dependency tree around them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m04s)

[which is great so it has to wait on that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m07s)

[and then more importantly this job only](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m09s)

[executes if that output is true](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m11s)

[which is perfect this is exactly what i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m15s)

[was hoping for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m17s)

[so if that output is true](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m19s)

[you'll note this was based entirely](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m22s)

[around checking on the presence of a tag](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m23s)

[called nightly release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m26s)

[and so if it finds that there are](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m28s)

[changes at the very end of this the last](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m30s)

[thing it does is it'll take that nightly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m33s)

[release tag and move it now in general](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m35s)

[with github repos tags aren't supposed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m38s)

[to move that's bad](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m41s)

[right like that is not a good thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m45s)

[um and i thought about doing this with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m47s)

[branches and doing merges and that kind](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m48s)

[of thing i'm like you know i don't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m50s)

[really want to do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m52s)

[tags are lightweight](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m54s)

[but fair warning](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m55s)

[don't point anything at this tag](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h33m57s)

[this tag is now special and is going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m00s)

[move around which is something you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m02s)

[normally don't do with git tags because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m04s)

[they're intended to point to a given](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m07s)

[commit and stay there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m09s)

[problem is in this case it's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m12s)

[legitimately going to move possibly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m13s)

[every single night](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m18s)

[but if you see that tag hanging out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m19s)

[there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m21s)

[like here with this nightly release](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m22s)

[this was done on 9-1 which i believe](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m24s)

[what's today's date the second so this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m28s)

[was last night's one that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m30s)

[happened and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m32s)

[now we've done a couple and when this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m34s)

[pipeline kicks off](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m37s)

[uh later tonight what should happen is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m38s)

[it'll detect the change](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m41s)

[go ahead and do that uh preview nougat](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m44s)

[release move the tag up and then if](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m46s)

[nothing merges for a few days that's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m48s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m50s)

[it'll just hang out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m52s)

[should be awesome](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m53s)

[okay so let's go here and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m55s)

[combo box action combo box action](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h34m59s)

[okay so i'm gonna have to reset and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m03s)

[remember because this has been now how](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m05s)

[long since i touched this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m07s)

[fix two three four oh so this is this is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m10s)

[where this is at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m12s)

[let's start with rebasing this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m15s)

[guy onto master i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m18s)

[uh what is this guy doing here that's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m22s)

[just a fuchsia background](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m24s)

[that's not overly helpful but i think it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m29s)

[kind of is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m32s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m35s)

[let's leave that there for the moment](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m40s)

[but i'd like to rebase this onto master](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m45s)

[for those people unfamiliar with rebase](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m46s)

[what this ends up doing is it takes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m48s)

[those two commits that i had here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m50s)

[backs up until it gets on to master](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m54s)

[resets the base effectively the starting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m56s)

[point because this commit here was the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h35m59s)

[base of these two commits previously](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m00s)

[changes the base to here and then](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m03s)

[replays those commits one at a time so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m05s)

[it as though i just started making these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m07s)

[changes now](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m09s)

[which means if there was going to be any](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m11s)

[conflicts](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m14s)

[this is when they would show up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m15s)

[okay and then we are going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m18s)

[force push this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m21s)

[because when you do that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m24s)

[you rewrite history and that's generally](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m25s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m27s)

[and did to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m31s)

[so let's let's pop this stash off](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m32s)

[and we'll start here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m36s)

[we will start here so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m38s)

[uh we don't need the examples repo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m40s)

[anymore that can go away](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m42s)

[let's come back over here so reload yes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m45s)

[i understand i just ripped out the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m47s)

[foundation underneath you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m48s)

[your world is unhappy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m50s)

[we'll fix that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m54s)

[we will fix that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h36m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m01s)

[so let's let's reset ourselves and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m02s)

[recall what exactly this bug is in the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m04s)

[interesting cases with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m22s)

[with combo boxes so in this case the the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m25s)

[when you click some controls when they](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m48s)

[receive that event](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m50s)

[do stuff with them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m53s)

[previously combo box was going through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m55s)

[and i believe blocking all clicks from](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h37m57s)

[making it all the way through i can't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m00s)

[remember it was either blocking them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m01s)

[from getting through and it shouldn't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m03s)

[or it wasn't blocking them and it should](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m05s)

[or one of the two directions i don't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m07s)

[remember](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m10s)

[yeah so there is contention between](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m23s)

[allowing the cursor to interact with the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m25s)

[editable text box versus controlling the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m26s)

[pop-up state](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m29s)

[and this is one of those](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m32s)

[i almost want to take a stab](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m35s)

[at redoing the combo boxes template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m39s)

[wholesale](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m41s)

[let's do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m50s)

[because this is the combo box had](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m52s)

[there's i i know there i'm only saying](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m54s)

[this because i know there's a few other](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m55s)

[bugs sitting in the backlog that i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m57s)

[wasn't planning on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h38m59s)

[addressing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m00s)

[uh new](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m02s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m03s)

[template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m05s)

[so let's let's back this guy up a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m06s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m09s)

[we're gonna](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m10s)

[we're gonna just discard this change i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m12s)

[don't i don't think that fuchsia is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m13s)

[overly relevant](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m15s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m18s)

[let's go here and look at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m19s)

[combo boxes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m22s)

[so combo boxes have many states that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m24s)

[they can possibly be in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m26s)

[what is this why is this so ugly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m29s)

[probably need to fix that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m39s)

[that looks](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m42s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m44s)

[what is different about this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m49s)

[only difference is editable](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m52s)

[because this is just hint stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h39m56s)

[need to look at this one here in a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m00s)

[moment but combo boxes has several](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m01s)

[states one you can do this picker option](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m04s)

[wow is this thing just broken](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m08s)

[hang on let me i'm gonna i'm gonna re](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m11s)

[recompile after i change my branch i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m13s)

[don't know if it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m16s)

[appropriately brought me backwards](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m18s)

[because that could have legitimately](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m20s)

[just been a bug on that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m21s)

[okay so combo box combo box combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m25s)

[there we go that's what that's what it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m30s)

[should look like so you can pick this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m32s)

[and within material design there are](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m34s)

[several](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m36s)

[layers to this combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m38s)

[so you've got your your default combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m40s)

[box and you'll note as i pick items here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m42s)

[the selected item moves out of its](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m44s)

[position in the combo box up to the top](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m47s)

[that's simple mode number one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m50s)

[it gets a little more complex when you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m52s)

[start having things like this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m56s)

[you'll note there's this text box that i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m57s)

[can type into and you'll note this text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h40m59s)

[box is both editable](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m01s)

[both while the pop-up is open and while](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m04s)

[the pop-up is closed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m07s)

[which aligns with the wpf editable combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m13s)

[box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m16s)

[the hard part here is how you handle](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m17s)

[that so in normal wpf mode this text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m20s)

[just lives wherever the combo box does](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m24s)

[and a pop-up is shown below it with the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m26s)

[items](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m28s)

[so the pop-up isn't necessarily related](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m29s)

[to this however here what we have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m32s)

[is and i don't know if it's obvious let](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m34s)

[me switch to light thing i think it's a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m36s)

[little more obvious than light theme](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m37s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m40s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m41s)

[you'll note the pop-up surrounds](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m42s)

[the the text box so what the template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m46s)

[does right now is in that pop-up it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m49s)

[actually tries to cut a hole out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m52s)

[and position itself such that that hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m54s)

[is right over the top of the text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m57s)

[the problem is that's hard to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h41m59s)

[accurately especially when you start](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m01s)

[dealing with like sub pixel rendering](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m03s)

[and um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m05s)

[not using layout rounding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m06s)

[this thing doesn't line up and the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m09s)

[number of times we've had bugs where the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m10s)

[thing shifts just slightly and sometimes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m13s)

[it's in the library and sometimes it's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m16s)

[in the user code](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m18s)

[of who's using the library but it's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m19s)

[really hard to tell and it's a pain in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m22s)

[the neck](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m24s)

[i have dreamed of having a version of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m25s)

[this template that does not do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m28s)

[that instead of doing this what it does](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m31s)

[is it lifts a copy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m33s)

[of the text box up and then puts it back](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m36s)

[that's my dream that's the dream](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m39s)

[i think it's obtainable](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m43s)

[i don't know for sure i think it is but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m45s)

[that's where i think i would like to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m47s)

[is try to write a template that does](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m49s)

[this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m51s)

[does this and works](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m54s)

[without but puts the text box inside of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h42m57s)

[the pop-up rather than behind it the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m00s)

[other one that bites all the time](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m02s)

[is with colors because this thing is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m04s)

[cutting a hole all the way down right](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m06s)

[now it's easy to hide that hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m08s)

[because the backgrounds are the same](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m11s)

[color but as soon as that background](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m12s)

[down here changes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m14s)

[now you have a problem and you can see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m17s)

[the hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m19s)

[it's no no bueno](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m25s)

[let's let's see how obtainable that is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m27s)

[that's that's where i think i want to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m31s)

[try and do this because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m32s)

[this combo box has been a thorn in my](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m35s)

[side since i have started working on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m38s)

[this library and i've dreamed of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m40s)

[changing it but it's also one of the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m42s)

[more complex](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m43s)

[one of the more complex templates that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m45s)

[we have here so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m47s)

[we are going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m50s)

[to uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m52s)

[yeah you'll know there's all of these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m54s)

[pop-up control templates and all of that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m56s)

[jazz because it needs to deal with it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h43m58s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m00s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m01s)

[here's the text box style](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m03s)

[and that's all fine i think i don't know](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m07s)

[if i need a muck with that yet](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m10s)

[yet](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m12s)

[uh combo box item](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m13s)

[combo box item](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m16s)

[material design combo box selected](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m20s)

[collapsed blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m21s)

[combo box toggle button](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m24s)

[uh floating hint](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m28s)

[okay so here's the here's the big guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m30s)

[here's the big guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m34s)

[and this is where i want to see if we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m37s)

[can come up with a better](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m38s)

[design](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m41s)

[okay so there is edible true](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m44s)

[show selected item](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m48s)

[this is that bring the selected item to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m51s)

[the top bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h44m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m01s)

[let's do here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m02s)

[here is the template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m05s)

[okay so we have we set up an adornal](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m08s)

[layer around this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m11s)

[let's just start breaking this apart and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m14s)

[figuring out what are the what are the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m15s)

[relevant pieces](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m17s)

[okay so combo box pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m20s)

[clear button over the top of the text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m23s)

[box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m26s)

[okay so this canvas here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m30s)

[is for what the helper](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m33s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m41s)

[okay so that's the underline](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m46s)

[this border here and this is the toggle](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m49s)

[button so this is the drop down up down](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m51s)

[arrow on the side okay so that's fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m53s)

[underlines fine that's the line at the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m56s)

[bottom that's fine combo box so it's the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h45m58s)

[interaction between this combo box and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m01s)

[this border](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m03s)

[and you can imagine trying to get that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m05s)

[hole positioned in the right place when](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m07s)

[you deal with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m08s)

[uh padding and margin and borders and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m10s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m14s)

[let's say complex](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m15s)

[okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m19s)

[this is the editable text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m25s)

[okay so on editable true](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m33s)

[this guy becomes visible](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m41s)

[and i'm thinking](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m44s)

[thinking what we do is over here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m47s)

[you have a template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m51s)

[so there is classic mode](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m55s)

[up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m58s)

[and down content template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h46m59s)

[and classic content templates see there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m02s)

[is just so much going on here okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m04s)

[this is the down template this is the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m07s)

[one that's most likely going to trigger](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m08s)

[element name height part pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m17s)

[this is where all that sizing starts to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m22s)

[occur](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m25s)

[and i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m27s)

[i think i could throw most of this away](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m30s)

[think about this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m35s)

[i think we can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m40s)

[i think we can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m47s)

[because the whole point of most of these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m53s)

[borders is just to bring in a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h47m54s)

[that nice rounded effect](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m02s)

[so for example this guy here is only](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m04s)

[here for the purpose of doing a shadow](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m06s)

[so we don't care about him](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m08s)

[this is technically the default so we'll](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m12s)

[just get rid of that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m14s)

[so we've got a grid](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m15s)

[that contains a single row](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m18s)

[and technically a single column](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m21s)

[with height auto so technically none of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m24s)

[that's required because that's all the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m26s)

[defaults](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m28s)

[we've got two borders that sit one on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m29s)

[top of the other the first border is the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m32s)

[this one here is um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m35s)

[lower in the z order so it's going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m37s)

[on the bottom whereas the later one is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m39s)

[going to sit on top](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m41s)

[you know this has a border thickness of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m44s)

[one this has a margin of one just so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m46s)

[that those things offset a little bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m48s)

[and this guy is what is applying that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m56s)

[shadow](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h48m59s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m01s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m02s)

[and the only reason for this is to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m04s)

[the shadow with the um the appropriate](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m06s)

[corner radius](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m08s)

[okay so what do we got going on here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m11s)

[so let's see three auto rows one that's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m15s)

[going to fill and one that's at the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m18s)

[bottom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m20s)

[so this is clearly going to be the one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m21s)

[that contains all the items this is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m23s)

[going to be the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m24s)

[the rounded bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m26s)

[at the bottom it does this maneuver](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m27s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m32s)

[let's see so this guy sits at the top](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m36s)

[top margin](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m39s)

[left right margin](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m45s)

[so this must these just must be statics](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m49s)

[up here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m51s)

[top bottom margin left right margin](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m55s)

[okay that makes sense](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h49m58s)

[give those borders some size around them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m14s)

[what i'm missing is where the hole is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m17s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m21s)

[that's a grid there this sits on top](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m24s)

[that's the top thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m28s)

[this grid sits here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m30s)

[and contains the left and right stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m35s)

[oh is this it right here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m41s)

[is this the hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m43s)

[uh looks like it because of how it's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m48s)

[sized](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m50s)

[this border sits down below it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h50m56s)

[center extended and then](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m05s)

[that guy there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m09s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m10s)

[so this guy here is the hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m12s)

[and i think we can confirm that really](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m18s)

[quick so let's grab snoop](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m20s)

[let's let's just confirm that that is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m24s)

[the behavior here because i think what i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m26s)

[would like to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m29s)

[is we might my thought is i can probably](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m31s)

[leave a lot of this in place](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m33s)

[uh and instead of having a hole just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m36s)

[lift the text box into the pop-up and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m40s)

[have it cover because then if it's off](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m43s)

[by half a pixel in any direction i don't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m45s)

[care](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m47s)

[those margins as we saw are like four](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m48s)

[and eight that's my margin of error](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m51s)

[i gotta get within four pixels that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m54s)

[seems a lot easier](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m56s)

[okay so let's go here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h51m58s)

[let's grab snoop okay snoop onto the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m00s)

[side for anybody who didn't see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m02s)

[crosshairs on the binoculars drag over](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m04s)

[the window that we care about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m06s)

[and then the magical keyboard shortcut](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m08s)

[once you get snoop open ctrl shift](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m10s)

[okay so that gets us into here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m14s)

[and i think what we can do is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m23s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m23s)

[let's see that is there there's the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m29s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m31s)

[is drop down open](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m34s)

[kick that guy open for me](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m37s)

[oh it um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m39s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m43s)

[i need to find the pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m46s)

[and change the stays](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m50s)

[open](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m53s)

[oh it's going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m55s)

[it's going to be a little bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m57s)

[problematic isn't it okay fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h52m58s)

[let's go here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m01s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m03s)

[that's our combo box item this is our](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m06s)

[items presenter](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m09s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m12s)

[there's our top separator corner](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m17s)

[where is the oh this is inside the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m23s)

[content presenter so we need to back our](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m26s)

[way up so this is theory](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m27s)

[there's the grid this is what i believe](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m29s)

[is the hole so we open it and sure](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m31s)

[enough this red border confirms that is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m34s)

[in fact the hole so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m37s)

[where that grid is located](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m39s)

[if i could lift](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m41s)

[that text box up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m44s)

[problem solved](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m47s)

[problem solved](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m49s)

[okay and the other thing that gives me a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m52s)

[little bit more control over this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m54s)

[is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m57s)

[this guy here isn't just a regular](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h53m58s)

[pop-up control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m00s)

[no no no he's a custom pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m02s)

[specifically because he's got all of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m06s)

[this offset and measuring stuff around](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m08s)

[him which i i think i leave most of this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m11s)

[here because it would be a breaking](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m13s)

[change to remove it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m14s)

[and then more importantly because i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m16s)

[don't think i need it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m18s)

[but i can leverage it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m20s)

[how does that work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m26s)

[does that hole exist on the other one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m30s)

[too then](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m32s)

[does it always show through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m40s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m46s)

[that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m47s)

[it always shows through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m49s)

[interesting okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h54m57s)

[if it always shows through what is the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m08s)

[shoot maybe i shouldn't attempt this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m12s)

[because then the question is how do i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m16s)

[know what the item is there and what](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m18s)

[should it do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m21s)

[what should it do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m26s)

[boy it would still be really nice to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m30s)

[lift that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m31s)

[be really really nice to lift that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m34s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m37s)

[well let's let's continue because i i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m38s)

[kind of want to push this a little bit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m39s)

[to see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m41s)

[how it goes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m42s)

[because what i would like to have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m43s)

[this guy doesn't have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m46s)

[that much to him](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m48s)

[so we're going to do is we are going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m50s)

[move you up here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m52s)

[we are going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m55s)

[drop you right here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h55m56s)

[um we're gonna drop the name because i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m02s)

[don't know if it's well we'll leave it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m04s)

[for now we might end up needing it so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m05s)

[grid column one it by magic it just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m08s)

[lines up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m10s)

[is read only doesn't give me a i'm going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m12s)

[to have to lift that property](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m16s)

[or i'm going to have to give myself a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m19s)

[source to bind to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m21s)

[now i think what i can do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m23s)

[i think what i can do so i could give](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m32s)

[myself an extra property here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m34s)

[i'm already abusing the tag property](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m37s)

[i'm kind of thinking that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m41s)

[let's just let's just give ourselves](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m48s)

[another property to play with i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m49s)

[that's the easiest](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m51s)

[right](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m54s)

[is there a cleaner is there a cleaner](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m56s)

[option](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h56m58s)

[i don't think there's a better option](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m02s)

[though this suffix bit gives me a bit of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m08s)

[pause](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m10s)

[same with the prefix because we would](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m16s)

[end up having to lift](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m18s)

[not just this but the whole thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m24s)

[i think that's okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m30s)

[i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m33s)

[i think we do it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m36s)

[because when they're down](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h57m58s)

[this pop-up and again i've i've got dark](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m00s)

[theme turned on so that's not helpful](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m02s)

[turn the light theme on this pop-up here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m04s)

[there's a hole in it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m06s)

[that shows through to this lower control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m09s)

[and i'm not entirely sure the best way](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m12s)

[to lift this thing up i'm kind of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m14s)

[thinking](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m16s)

[kind of thinking that i might just do a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m19s)

[template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m21s)

[you know what no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m23s)

[no no no no no no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m24s)

[the simplest thing to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m27s)

[the absolute simplest thing to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m29s)

[is copy and paste](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m33s)

[and i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m39s)

[yeah i think the simplest thing to do is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m49s)

[copy and paste and i think what i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m51s)

[actually want to copy is this entire](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m54s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m56s)

[because this contains not only the text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h58m59s)

[box it contains the content presenter](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m00s)

[yeah i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m05s)

[and then i don't think i need to give](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m07s)

[myself another property okay so we're](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m08s)

[gonna replace](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m10s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m12s)

[with a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m14s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m16s)

[that's that's that's a lot but let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m20s)

[where that gets us let's see where that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m23s)

[gets us](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m24s)

[okay so now that we have this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m26s)

[some of these things we can legitimately](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m31s)

[leave the template bindings here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m33s)

[however some of these things like the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m37s)

[horizontal content alignment](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m39s)

[that one is never going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m41s)

[but what i can do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m47s)

[oh i know what we can do we can do a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m52s)

[data context here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m53s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m56s)

[yes and we can bind](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=00h59m58s)

[we can bind to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m02s)

[the pop-up control so let's do a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m04s)

[relative source](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m07s)

[relative source ancestor type](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m09s)

[combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m13s)

[box pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m14s)

[so that'll get me](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m17s)

[all the way up to the pop-up control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m21s)

[and then what i want to do is i want to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m23s)

[set the path on that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m25s)

[to grab the placement](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m28s)

[target](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m31s)

[and i believe](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m34s)

[if we go back down here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m36s)

[so the relative source will get me up to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m38s)

[the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m43s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m44s)

[boy i almost wish i could relative](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m47s)

[source relative source](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m49s)

[because what i really want to do is get](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m52s)

[all the way up to the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h00m57s)

[get all the way up to the combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m00s)

[control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m03s)

[yeah let's just give myself a property](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m08s)

[on here that that'll probably be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m10s)

[simplest okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m14s)

[that's a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m17s)

[um we'll just go at the top for now okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m22s)

[so depend](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m26s)

[what is it prop dependency property boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m31s)

[okay and this is going to be a combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m34s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m40s)

[and apparently it can't figure out the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m44s)

[owner class that's exciting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m46s)

[and this is not going to be a zero this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m50s)

[is going to be a null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m52s)

[okay that'll be good enough](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h01m57s)

[yeah we'll we'll expression body these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m01s)

[things okay don't want to spend too much](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m03s)

[time on this that's not the objective at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m04s)

[the moment okay so down here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m07s)

[uh we'll just do it at the bottom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m10s)

[uh so the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m13s)

[combo box property](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m18s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m22s)

[oh actually i could do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m24s)

[does that work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m30s)

[i've never tried a template binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m33s)

[without a path on it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m35s)

[but the source of the template binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m38s)

[is supposed to be the item being](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m40s)

[templated](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m42s)

[which in this case is in fact the combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m44s)

[box let's stop execution i'm guessing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m46s)

[the compiler is probably](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m48s)

[probably losing its mind with the edit](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m50s)

[and continue bits](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m54s)

[let's just build real quick because i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h02m58s)

[that that little squiggle should](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m01s)

[disappear after a compile](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m03s)

[once it realizes that yes there is in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m07s)

[fact something there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m09s)

[and no it is not a bad thing whoa](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m12s)

[um okay so there's it's unhappy about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m16s)

[what we did up here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m19s)

[well it should be unhappy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m25s)

[so this guy here because we are being](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m27s)

[because we are templating](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m30s)

[content](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m34s)

[we should be able to do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m36s)

[and so because we're doing this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m39s)

[we should be able to go combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m42s)

[and so these things should be able to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m46s)

[switch](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m48s)

[and this is going to look a little funny](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m49s)

[but now i can do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m54s)

[because the data context has changed the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m56s)

[data context is the default source for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h03m58s)

[bindings](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m00s)

[the data context is now the combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m02s)

[even though i'm inside of a content](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m04s)

[control on a pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m06s)

[i've now exposed that combo box set its](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m08s)

[data context and all these template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m10s)

[bindings](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m12s)

[can simply be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m13s)

[bindings](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m16s)

[poof](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m21s)

[um this is not going to work though](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m25s)

[and it's going to need](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m29s)

[page up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m33s)

[darn it page up and page down not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m36s)

[working at the same way](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m40s)

[this goes like this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m42s)

[so s the attached properties are not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m45s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m48s)

[be a straight syntax swap but we can do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m51s)

[that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m53s)

[okay so then you just become binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h04m58s)

[you become binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m02s)

[that goes like that that goes like that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m10s)

[and oh that's an attached property so we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m14s)

[need to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m16s)

[wrap them up so we can decode it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m18s)

[properly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m20s)

[binding goes there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m22s)

[binding goes there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m25s)

[smart hint](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m29s)

[this is probably not going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m39s)

[i'll have to look at how to solve that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m47s)

[one that one's going to be a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m48s)

[weird but for now we won't worry about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m49s)

[it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m52s)

[i think it'll get back in null which](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m53s)

[will be just fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m54s)

[um it just means the hint stuff is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h05m58s)

[probably not going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m00s)

[see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m05s)

[there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m06s)

[because if this ends up working this as](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m11s)

[much as i hate this we can then work on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m14s)

[separating this into](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m16s)

[oh i don't even know can i make it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m18s)

[shared code](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m20s)

[i might not be able to the hard part is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m23s)

[template bindings are evaluated compile](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m26s)

[time](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m29s)

[whereas regular bindings are evaluated](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m30s)

[run time](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m33s)

[which is why template bindings are more](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m34s)

[performant](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m36s)

[but they also have more limitations as](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m38s)

[far as how you can do your bindings](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m40s)

[but most of the time when you're doing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m43s)

[control templates you will know](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m45s)

[effectively they're forwarding your](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m48s)

[bindings up ahead of time and you'll](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m50s)

[know those things at compile time](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m52s)

[most of the time](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m54s)

[most of it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m56s)

[in this case we are doing something a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h06m58s)

[little abusive](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m00s)

[just a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m01s)

[but i think it'll get us](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m06s)

[really close to a much better solution](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m09s)

[because then i think part of the problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m12s)

[will go away](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m14s)

[because we will not have a click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m16s)

[that is now leaving the pop-up control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m18s)

[that that is fundamentally part of the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m21s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m23s)

[is we've got](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m24s)

[a click event that occurs and when the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m27s)

[click hits goes through the middle of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m29s)

[that hole on the pop-up it's now leaving](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m31s)

[the pop-up and putting focus somewhere](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m33s)

[else outside of the pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m35s)

[and the pop-up's going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m37s)

[focus has left me i should close just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m39s)

[like if the user clicked off to the side](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m42s)

[not quite what we want not quite what we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m45s)

[want so by lifting this up it means the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m47s)

[focus is going to remain inside of the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m50s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m52s)

[effectively solving the problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m53s)

[okay almost done almost done](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h07m57s)

[and then we and then we test and see how](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m00s)

[close this got us](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m02s)

[and i fully expect that this is going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m04s)

[break a ton of stuff because the other](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m06s)

[thing that this isn't taking into](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m08s)

[account](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m10s)

[is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m11s)

[um triggers](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m12s)

[but i think what we can do is we can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m14s)

[adjust some of these guys](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m18s)

[to account for that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m25s)

[yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m26s)

[this wants an element binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m29s)

[you know what we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m37s)

[and i'm not gonna worry](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m41s)

[here let's leave it here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m43s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m45s)

[we'll need to figure out how to do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m47s)

[this just means the suffix is to be not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m49s)

[properly offset in the clear button](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m51s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m54s)

[that's fine i i think what we can do in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m55s)

[these situations is rather than binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h08m57s)

[margin to the same setup i think what i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m01s)

[actually want to do is just forward](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m04s)

[these properties to the lower control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m05s)

[underneath them and just get the value](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m07s)

[that way that way as triggers and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m09s)

[whatnot change those elements these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m11s)

[things adjust accordingly and i don't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m13s)

[have to duplicate triggers and all that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m14s)

[jazz that just sounds like work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m16s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m19s)

[let's try this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m21s)

[and right now success looks like being](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m23s)

[able to open the page without the app](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m26s)

[crash](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m28s)

[we're gonna set expectations low](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m29s)

[success is just not blowing up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m34s)

[because then we can start investigating](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m38s)

[all of the stuff that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m40s)

[that should work that doesn't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m42s)

[okay this is the part where it crashes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m44s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m48s)

[object reference not set to the instance](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m51s)

[of an object](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m52s)

[great](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m54s)

[what exactly is null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h09m56s)

[i'm sorry i'm gonna need a little more](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m03s)

[to go on here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m05s)

[style helper](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m08s)

[boy they](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m10s)

[uh we have a very large stack trace](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m12s)

[see if we can get more information so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m17s)

[load deferred content that's a bit of a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m20s)

[clue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m23s)

[that's going to be a template or similar](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m27s)

[but we kind of knew that already](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m29s)

[it's triggered by it on property change](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m33s)

[so let's see combo boxes initialize](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m35s)

[component](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m37s)

[calls load component which loads up the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m38s)

[baml](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m40s)

[which was the xaml that got compiled in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m41s)

[for that view okay makes sense](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m44s)

[right node](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m53s)

[through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m57s)

[no write no did not right any member](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h10m58s)

[do assignment apply to property value](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m01s)

[parse xaml](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m06s)

[update tables](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m09s)

[boy i really wish there was more data on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m13s)

[this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m16s)

[because that's not that helpful](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m18s)

[okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m21s)

[not surprising it's there so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m24s)

[most likely explanation is something new](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m28s)

[that we just added](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m30s)

[so let's start with let's keep it simple](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m33s)

[and say it is something inside of the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m37s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m40s)

[and let's just make sure we can get](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m41s)

[that much working](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m44s)

[and actually this grid should be going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m46s)

[away too](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m48s)

[let's assume it's something inside of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m51s)

[the grid](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m53s)

[very likely](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m55s)

[but this at least confirms that we can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m57s)

[get our pop-up get the combo box and the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h11m59s)

[pop-up and do these relative bindings](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m02s)

[that's that's it that's what we're going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m05s)

[for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m06s)

[oh capslock](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m13s)

[okay so we didn't even get that far](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m16s)

[okay so that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m20s)

[that tells me we might be in this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m23s)

[vicinity](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m31s)

[and it's possible it's this template uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m37s)

[i bet you it's this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m41s)

[template binding so binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m43s)

[relative source relative source](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m45s)

[let's try this so this is this style of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h12m57s)

[binding here with a relative source is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m00s)

[very similar to a templated binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m01s)

[except for rather it does the lookup in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m05s)

[basically the same way or at least](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m09s)

[functions the same way the the big](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m10s)

[difference is rather than doing it at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m12s)

[compile time it will do it at runtime](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m14s)

[and i'm thinking that what's happening](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m20s)

[especially with where that error is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m22s)

[inside of the the baml stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m23s)

[that the template binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m26s)

[with no path](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m28s)

[is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m32s)

[no happy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m33s)

[and i'm wondering if this ah](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m44s)

[so that is better](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m47s)

[okay so now](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m50s)

[so that template binding was](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m52s)

[was in fact a problem so now let's put](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m54s)

[all of this back](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h13m56s)

[okay edit and continue for the win](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m02s)

[okay so and then the hint proxy is going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m07s)

[to fail okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m09s)

[that is a bit of an issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m11s)

[that one where i said don't know how to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m14s)

[solve it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m19s)

[we're gonna just comment it out for now](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m23s)

[because right now what that will mean is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m26s)

[the hint is not going to behave](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m27s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m28s)

[fine i don't care](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m30s)

[i don't care we'll deal with hint stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m32s)

[later because we've got a hint issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m33s)

[we've got a suffix issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m35s)

[come back to those](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m38s)

[come back to those later what i want to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m40s)

[see is these things actually work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m42s)

[uh okay cannot find resources named](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m51s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m56s)

[so it's having trouble finding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h14m59s)

[the style](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m03s)

[oh because i've moved it up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m09s)

[oh that is subtle that is subtle so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m12s)

[here's here's the kicker](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m15s)

[this is on line 167.](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m17s)

[this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m21s)

[is line 257](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m22s)

[we are going to fix this by just simply](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m28s)

[moving it up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m35s)

[you don't have anything that is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m36s)

[there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m41s)

[that should get you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m44s)

[closer i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m47s)

[okay so there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h15m56s)

[okay let's take a look here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m00s)

[okay so that's clearly not right](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m10s)

[things are overlapping on top of each](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m14s)

[other where they shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m16s)

[so something's wrong there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m19s)

[oh this guy is not in the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m24s)

[column one so that's problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m28s)

[so the one thing i was interested in is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m56s)

[if you do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h16m58s)

[okay so we might have to fix this i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m04s)

[think is actually going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m06s)

[obviously this is not you can see the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m10s)

[offset that isn't quite lining up there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m12s)

[that's okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m15s)

[that is okay i think this is actually](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m17s)

[going to make this a little easier](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m19s)

[i think this is actually going to make](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m25s)

[it a little bit easier](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m26s)

[okay so in order to get this hint](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m32s)

[working we're going to need to bind](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m34s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m38s)

[no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m41s)

[that back](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m43s)

[um okay in order to get this hint](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m44s)

[binding we need to deal with these guys](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m46s)

[and address that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m49s)

[so this has effectively the same problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m51s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m54s)

[actually this one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m57s)

[why didn't i just fix this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h17m59s)

[this is not hard to solve](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m03s)

[because this is not relative parent](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m05s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m07s)

[because relative parent on the other one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m08s)

[was going to be the combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m10s)

[and we just set ourselves](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m13s)

[to the combo box as our data context](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m16s)

[so that's that one's easy so this we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m20s)

[should be able to fix that hint proxy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m22s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m23s)

[which should make this work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m29s)

[which is better](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m31s)

[okay so let's no wrong window come over](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m44s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m47s)

[combo boxes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m49s)

[okay so if we go here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m52s)

[aside from scene double](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h18m59s)

[oh we're only seeing double because it's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m05s)

[able to get all the way through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m07s)

[i think we just need to push this down a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m16s)

[little bit and give us some space but i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m18s)

[think we're getting very very close okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m20s)

[okay so that fixes that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m23s)

[the suffix we still need to address](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m26s)

[getting access to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m28s)

[another element](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m32s)

[that's fine that's fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m38s)

[okay so i'm gonna get rid of that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m44s)

[so the issue that we have here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m47s)

[i think we can get rid of most of these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m54s)

[background bits can't we](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h19m56s)

[i believe what we can do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m03s)

[i think a lot of this is about to get a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m11s)

[lot simpler because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m13s)

[this guy is now](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m16s)

[just doing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m18s)

[the margin](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m20s)

[this background now gets inherited i i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m23s)

[have a feeling a lot of this stuff is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m25s)

[going to boil away into](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m27s)

[just margins](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m29s)

[on the the root level here in a bit i i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m31s)

[think it's going to get that simple](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m34s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m39s)

[your background doesn't matter anymore](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m40s)

[your background doesn't matter anymore](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m43s)

[your background doesn't matter anymore](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m46s)

[sweet that made that simpler](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m49s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m53s)

[okay so that gets me to there let's just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m56s)

[relaunch and check and see how that does](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h20m59s)

[because now we should stop seeing double](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m01s)

[on those hints](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m02s)

[and i think that suffix positioning is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m09s)

[the only thing left](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m11s)

[yeah so aside from seeing that thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m19s)

[bounce a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m21s)

[not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m36s)

[am i not able to click on that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m39s)

[so i must have been interacting with the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m48s)

[element underneath rather than the one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m50s)

[on top](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m51s)

[okay so let's do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m52s)

[snoop nope nope very much visual studio](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m55s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h21m58s)

[okay so i want to get access](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m01s)

[move you to the side i would like to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m04s)

[look at the thingy that's right there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m11s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m13s)

[that thingy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m20s)

[show it to me](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m22s)

[it is zero](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m25s)

[that thingy is also zero](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m37s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m46s)

[so that wait](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m49s)

[this thing has a data context of combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m51s)

[box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m53s)

[this thing has a data text of combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h22m56s)

[the content presenter has its data](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m01s)

[context changed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m03s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m06s)

[that kind of makes sense unfortunately](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m07s)

[the edible text box though which is what](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m11s)

[should be here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m14s)

[does have access to it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m16s)

[same with the other ones](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m19s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m22s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m23s)

[content presenter we might have to fix](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m26s)

[some bindings on but we can we can work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m27s)

[with that so why are you editable text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m29s)

[box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m33s)

[why are you not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m42s)

[i get why you're triggering when i click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m44s)

[there but when i click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m46s)

[here i expect to see the text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m48s)

[where are you in this hierarchy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m52s)

[you have height you have width](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h23m56s)

[are you just not hit testable](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m02s)

[um let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m09s)

[is that his hit test visible it's there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m12s)

[text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m18s)

[you have text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m25s)

[something covering you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m29s)

[are you sitting on top and that's oh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m35s)

[are you sitting on top and covering it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m39s)

[hang on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m42s)

[visibility oh was i looking at the data](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m50s)

[context that whole time](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m52s)

[are you do you have size](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h24m56s)

[i was on the data context tab not on the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m02s)

[text box tab](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m05s)

[so you don't actually have size which is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m07s)

[definitely a problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m10s)

[text](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m13s)

[let's just put some text in you real](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m15s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m17s)

[does that give you size](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m18s)

[no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m25s)

[okay let's look at the template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m28s)

[why would](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m31s)

[setting you up like that not allow you](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m33s)

[to automatically size](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m35s)

[so you might be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m38s)

[you might be covering which is very](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m42s)

[likely](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m44s)

[and you always have a visibility of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m46s)

[collapsed ah okay so we are going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m48s)

[need to solve the forwarding for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m51s)

[elements](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m53s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h25m58s)

[question being what is the appropriate](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m05s)

[way to solve this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m08s)

[i could make properties and forward all](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m12s)

[of the relevant elements](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m14s)

[that's one choice](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m19s)

[is it the best choice](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m23s)

[is there a cleaner way to do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m26s)

[i don't know if there is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m30s)

[the combo box pop-up is already a custom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m34s)

[pop-up control that is written](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m36s)

[specifically to support our use of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m38s)

[the combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m41s)

[forwarding elements is not that big of a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m45s)

[deal](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m47s)

[it's unlikely that there's going to be a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m50s)

[significant number of elements ever](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m52s)

[added to this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m54s)

[they may change over time that could be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h26m59s)

[a thing i'm just trying to take a mental](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m01s)

[note of what the the maintenance cost of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m04s)

[this is going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m06s)

[because i want to make sure i'm](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m08s)

[building into something with a slower](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m10s)

[maintenance cost than what we have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m12s)

[i think that's okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m16s)

[i think that is okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m21s)

[i i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m27s)

[i think i'm okay with that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m30s)

[yeah i think i am](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m40s)

[i think i am okay with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m42s)

[that so let's do that next](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m44s)

[so the combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m48s)

[box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m51s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m54s)

[let's let's create some stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m55s)

[let's create some stuff](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h27m58s)

[so how about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m00s)

[editable text box so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m05s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m11s)

[you are going to be a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m12s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m15s)

[editable](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m18s)

[combo box editable text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m21s)

[i think we're going to go with that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m29s)

[once again the default will be null so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m30s)

[let's just test it with that much](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m32s)

[at play](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m36s)

[let's come down here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m39s)

[and in a similar fashion to how we did](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m42s)

[that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m44s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m46s)

[combo box editable text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m48s)

[i think i can just do an x reference](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m51s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m56s)

[that guy i think we can do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h28m59s)

[and then up here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m05s)

[what this ends up being is we get rid of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m08s)

[this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m09s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m14s)

[i think we set the data context on this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m19s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m22s)

[be binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m23s)

[and we get rid of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m26s)

[where did i set the other one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m32s)

[uh did](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m35s)

[oh this is the wrong](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m44s)

[place](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m48s)

[those stay there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m54s)

[we go up a little higher](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m57s)

[to here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h29m59s)

[and we go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m04s)

[the name can go away off of this because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m08s)

[that's not going to matter](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m10s)

[what will matter will be the data](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m12s)

[context](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m13s)

[finding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m15s)

[combo oh we need to get](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m16s)

[this guy removed](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m20s)

[and actually we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m23s)

[similar here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m25s)

[boom so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m27s)

[humble box editable text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m32s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m42s)

[and i actually don't know if the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m45s)

[horizontal](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m47s)

[alignment or vertical](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m51s)

[alignment is going to do anything here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m53s)

[i don't think these organs are going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m58s)

[do a darn thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h30m59s)

[because this combo box's position is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m01s)

[being controlled here and is auto](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m03s)

[having the horizontal alignment of it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m06s)

[being left to right isn't going to make](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m08s)

[a lick of difference](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m11s)

[so we're going to ignore that for the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m13s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m15s)

[i think](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m16s)

[okay so that goes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m21s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m29s)

[this becomes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m36s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m38s)

[visibility](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m40s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m43s)

[carrot brush](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m45s)

[binding is read only](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h31m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m01s)

[and really at the end of the day this is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m04s)

[going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m06s)

[we almost want to bind everything](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m07s)

[but we're gonna leave it like that for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m11s)

[now](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m13s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m15s)

[so let's fix these guys up for the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m16s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m18s)

[next name goes away](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m19s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m22s)

[put that back so that it's not broken](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m24s)

[content presenter is going to remain](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m27s)

[broken](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m29s)

[that guy's going to be fine these guys](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m30s)

[will be a little broken](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m32s)

[leave that name there just so i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m37s)

[keep track of it okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m40s)

[let's see if that gets us a little](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m42s)

[better](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m44s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h32m58s)

[the method or operation is not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m05s)

[implemented](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m06s)

[control is null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m08s)

[circle back here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m11s)

[oh this is because this hint proxy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m15s)

[is not going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m20s)

[this hint proxy needs to be combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m37s)

[let's change up the source of this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m45s)

[element name](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m50s)

[and then the path on this is going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m54s)

[data context](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m57s)

[so we'll cheat and get the combo buzz](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h33m59s)

[this is kind of a weird hacky way of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m01s)

[doing it is it jumps up here and grabs](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m03s)

[this data context because i know that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m05s)

[will be bound to the right thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m07s)

[this probably needs a cleaner solution](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m11s)

[let's try this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m18s)

[combo boxes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m19s)

[really](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m25s)

[oh is my x reference no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m27s)

[i wasn't 100 sure on that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m30s)

[i bet you that's problematic](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m38s)

[that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m48s)

[will do the trick](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h34m49s)

[you are still](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m11s)

[no](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m12s)

[i guess the question then is what is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m17s)

[let's confirm some of these values then](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m19s)

[um let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m23s)

[so we can look at what is set on the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m28s)

[pop-up before the pop-up is shown](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m30s)

[which i assume is the problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m35s)

[the combo box is set and combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m40s)

[editable text box is set](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m43s)

[the hint proxy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m46s)

[did i edit the wrong one again](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m53s)

[no that's fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m56s)

[in proxy here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h35m59s)

[changes so this changes the source of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m09s)

[the binding from the data context](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m12s)

[to the element with this name](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m15s)

[is this elements](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m21s)

[binding wrong](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m24s)

[should be fine](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m29s)

[i'm a little surprised that this would](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m44s)

[throw on that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m50s)

[i'm just trying to avoid having to go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m57s)

[through and apply this long ugly binding](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h36m58s)

[to every single one of these things](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m00s)

[i don't think that's going to make a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m09s)

[difference but let's try it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m11s)

[control is null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m16s)

[you know what here's what i'm going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m19s)

[do in the interest of simplicity](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m20s)

[if control is null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m23s)

[return no bang](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m31s)

[so this is the noble reference types](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m36s)

[that i alluded to earlier](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m41s)

[so if you are interested in learning](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m48s)

[more about them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m51s)

[the user group meeting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m52s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m55s)

[here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h37m58s)

[so free event](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m00s)

[uh my boss and i are speaking on them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m02s)

[but if you are at all interested in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m06s)

[learning more about knowable reference](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m07s)

[types in c-sharp and how to make good](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m09s)

[use of them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m11s)

[it will be a well worthwhile watch](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m12s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m16s)

[let's do that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m18s)

[we'll just short circuit when the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m20s)

[control is null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m21s)

[because i kind of want to look at this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m23s)

[and figure out why it's null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m25s)

[but i can't do that if it's constantly](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m28s)

[crashing in my face](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m29s)

[okay so let's go here and go](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m32s)

[okay so i would like to take a look at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m39s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m41s)

[and specifically let's see let's get out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m43s)

[of here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m46s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m49s)

[so your data context](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h38m54s)

[it's the combo box your data context](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m00s)

[is a text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m07s)

[and i want to find the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m08s)

[what the heck was it smart and something](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m11s)

[or another](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m13s)

[in proxy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m14s)

[so on the smart hint](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m17s)

[well this should have worked](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m27s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m44s)

[i wonder if this is an issue of it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m45s)

[starts as null and then changes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m47s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m53s)

[i betcha that's what it is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m54s)

[i bet you this was working all the while](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h39m57s)

[and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m01s)

[and just because that converter throws](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m07s)

[immediately on a null](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m09s)

[might have to change the nullability of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m15s)

[that thing okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m17s)

[so with that said though](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m19s)

[now i have access to the text box and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m22s)

[can](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m25s)

[type](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m26s)

[so the only issue though is the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m42s)

[well not the only issue there's a number](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m47s)

[of issues](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h40m49s)

[for starters the text property of this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m00s)

[appears to be getting cleared out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m02s)

[which is weird](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m15s)

[black](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m23s)

[see it's there and then if i click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m29s)

[it's still there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m33s)

[it's just that those are now getting out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m36s)

[of sync okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m38s)

[okay hang on hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m40s)

[we now have access to this so i should](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m43s)

[be able to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h41m46s)

[save those](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h42m31s)

[and now as i open this up and at least](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h42m33s)

[change this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h42m35s)

[i should see ape underneath](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h42m37s)

[okay so that is fine let's see about the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h42m47s)

[selection](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h42m50s)

[surprising to me that i don't see the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m04s)

[selection changing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m06s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m14s)

[oh are these](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m19s)

[yeah so let's](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m24s)

[kill](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m26s)

[thing because some of these might be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m27s)

[read only and text the text property on](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m29s)

[a text box is special it has a default](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m32s)

[binding mode](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m34s)

[of two-way by default](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m36s)

[whereas these ones are not going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m39s)

[this is also not going to be a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m43s)

[dependency property](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m45s)

[so that's going to be a problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h43m56s)

[shoot](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m00s)

[how do we do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m03s)

[how](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m14s)

[do we do this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m15s)

[because it would be nice to be able to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m27s)

[just pick the element up and move it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m29s)

[rather than cloning it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m30s)

[is that even possible](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m34s)

[i don't know if you can do that without](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m38s)

[a changing state](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m41s)

[but i'm wondering if i could](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m47s)

[pick it up and move it into here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m49s)

[i wonder if that would be a cleaner](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m56s)

[approach](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h44m58s)

[surprised these bindings aren't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m04s)

[complaining](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m06s)

[i would have expected these ones to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m10s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m12s)

[because without a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m16s)

[how's that going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m22s)

[yeah because it can only be set on a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m33s)

[not shocking so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m39s)

[that's gonna end up not working](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m42s)

[okay we may have just hit a brick wall](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m49s)

[on this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m51s)

[i'm not entirely sure how to fix it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m52s)

[either](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h45m55s)

[see how would be a proposed fix](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m00s)

[because you can't have](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m11s)

[a visual element that's owned by two](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m13s)

[things and i need it owned by the combo](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m15s)

[box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m17s)

[not the pop-up because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m20s)

[i the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m22s)

[the combo box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m24s)

[uses that text box on its template](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m25s)

[to do things like manage the keyboard](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m29s)

[input](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m30s)

[and so on events there's that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m32s)

[interaction back and forth like what](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m34s)

[we've seen](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m35s)

[where as you're typing it looks through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m37s)

[your items and attempts to find the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m39s)

[starts with match](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m42s)

[is this a viable option](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m49s)

[because we could go through the effort](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m51s)

[of wiring up for the selection events](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m53s)

[and trying to propagate the appropriate](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m57s)

[things two-way here](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h46m59s)

[that is a thing we could do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m02s)

[but is it a thing we should do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m04s)

[let's ask let's ask bing really quick](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m11s)

[uh let's see wpf](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m16s)

[move](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m19s)

[parent](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m23s)

[i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m27s)

[wonder](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h47m28s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m05s)

[because if it was just a matter of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m14s)

[displaying it you can cheat with like a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m15s)

[visual brush or similar](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m17s)

[and render it multiple times](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m20s)

[that's okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m22s)

[but in this case we need interaction](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m25s)

[oh actually there's an interesting](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m33s)

[thought](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m36s)

[there's an interesting thought](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m38s)

[so this idea is probably a bad one but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m46s)

[i'm going to say it out loud just](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m49s)

[to talk myself out of it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m51s)

[what if rather than copying the elements](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m57s)

[up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h48m59s)

[we put in a canvas](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m00s)

[or border or whatever we put in some](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m03s)

[control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m06s)

[into that hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m07s)

[but rather than a hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m09s)

[we put say a border](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m11s)

[and we set its background to be a visual](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m13s)

[brush of the content below it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m15s)

[and then we make it hit test visible](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m18s)

[false](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m20s)

[that doesn't solve the click problem](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m22s)

[though](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m24s)

[yeah like it would probably work to fix](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m27s)

[the alignment problems because then the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m29s)

[off by one pixels wouldn't show through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m32s)

[the hole because there would be no hole](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m34s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m36s)

[but](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m39s)

[we would still run into the issue](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m40s)

[of the click moving out of the pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m44s)

[and the whole point was to keep the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m46s)

[click and the focus inside of the pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h49m48s)

[so let's try let's just try moving it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h50m18s)

[how about this so we're gonna go with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h50m26s)

[content control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h50m29s)

[we'll go with grid column one](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h50m55s)

[so let's try that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h50m57s)

[and we're gonna try to lift that thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m01s)

[up and](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m03s)

[so we're gonna try to take the text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m04s)

[out when the pop-up's open put it in the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m06s)

[pop-up and then when the pop-up closes](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m08s)

[put it back](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m10s)

[that's the theory](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m12s)

[don't know how well this is going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m15s)

[work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m16s)

[really don't](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m19s)

[okay so what we want to do is i want to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m21s)

[do is there already a handler for is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h51m24s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h53m50s)

[and then we are going to go with cc](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h53m51s)

[content gets text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h53m55s)

[boom so that'll pick it up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h53m59s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h55m39s)

[for the laws of it at the moment to make](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h55m43s)

[i don't know if that's going to be](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h56m15s)

[logical or visual tree though so that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h56m16s)

[might this might be weird but we'll see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h56m18s)

[okay so how about](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h57m59s)

[just throw this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m02s)

[away this dot](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m04s)

[descendants](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m07s)

[get](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m10s)

[there's a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m11s)

[there's like a visual tree helper that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m22s)

[we have in here that has a helper method](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m25s)

[get visual children](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m28s)

[that's what i want](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m30s)

[so this get visual children](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m32s)

[i'm looking for ones that are of type](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m35s)

[content](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m37s)

[control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m43s)

[first or default](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m46s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m51s)

[go and include](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m52s)

[why are you not finding it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h58m54s)

[this dependency object](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m04s)

[oh this is in the oh hang on that's in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m07s)

[the test project that's why it's not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m10s)

[finding it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m12s)

[um is that the only place this exists](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m14s)

[let's look for usages of this method i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m26s)

[could have sworn there was something in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m28s)

[the main project that was hanging out in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m30s)

[there somewhere](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m35s)

[get visual depth first traversal that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m40s)

[will work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m43s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m45s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m47s)

[this is depth first not breadth first](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m50s)

[let's go with breadth first](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=01h59m54s)

[trying to think of which way is going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m00s)

[land on it first](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m01s)

[ultimately doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m03s)

[breadth first traversal we're going to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m06s)

[drop that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m08s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m09s)

[so we but we are going to throw on an of](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m10s)

[type](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m13s)

[content control](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m19s)

[give me link](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m20s)

[i need a period](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m23s)

[and then this is going to be x](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m25s)

[x dot](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m27s)

[name](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m33s)

[text box holder](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m36s)

[so i'm only interested in open for the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m39s)

[moment we'll circle back to closed if](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m41s)

[this actually works](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m43s)

[again i'm not 100 confident it's going](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m48s)

[to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m51s)

[i'm a](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m53s)

[pretty skeptical actually](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h00m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m01s)

[let's see locals where did it stop](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m04s)

[breath first traversal of type](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m15s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m16s)

[that's a little shocking](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m26s)

[oh i bet you this is supposed to be this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m32s)

[dot child or content](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m33s)

[let's try that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m37s)

[i'm a little shocked though that the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m40s)

[pop-up itself](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m42s)

[its visual](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m44s)

[thing wouldn't be a child](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m46s)

[maybe maybe](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m50s)

[i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m51s)

[don't really feel like debugging that at](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m54s)

[the moment](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h01m55s)

[okay boom boom](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m00s)

[oh we got inside excellent](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m02s)

[let's turn you off we actually hit the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m11s)

[mark](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m13s)

[so that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m28s)

[clicking on the text box](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m29s)

[closed it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m33s)

[i can't remember if that's expected or](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m38s)

[not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m40s)

[oh that actually totally worked](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m43s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m49s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h02m59s)

[i mean if that's going to work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m02s)

[we could probably make this](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m08s)

[this could probably be a viable solution](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m12s)

[just think about this if there's any](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m16s)

[drawbacks](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m17s)

[no this would be ideal](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m22s)

[now](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m26s)

[let's want to think all the way through](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m26s)

[the ramifications of this so it did](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m29s)

[close the pop-up when that thing](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m31s)

[received the click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m33s)

[but i can't remember if that is expected](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m35s)

[behavior or not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m38s)

[i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m46s)

[think it is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m47s)

[how could i test that](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m50s)

[i guess what should it be when you click](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m56s)

[on it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h03m59s)

[i mean the focus already moves into it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m02s)

[i kind of like that that's probably](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m07s)

[easiest because](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m10s)

[at the point you're interacting with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m12s)

[that it now behaves](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m13s)

[very similar](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m17s)

[to the wpf text box which i think is the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m18s)

[correct behavior](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m21s)

[i'm gonna check this in](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m24s)

[i'm gonna check this out it is](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m26s)

[it's getting late for me but i want to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m33s)

[not lose my work](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m35s)

[playing around with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m36s)

[lifting the controls](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m39s)

[directly into the pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m43s)

[i'll push that in case anybody wants to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m49s)

[play with it but i'm thinking that might](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m52s)

[be a nice useful solution because if the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m54s)

[controls are up in the pop-up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h04m56s)

[i think that would solve the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m03s)

[the other bug in question](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m05s)

[i think that i think it would](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m11s)

[simply because at that point](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m12s)

[the focus is inside of the pop-up not](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m16s)

[outside of it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m19s)

[because pop-ups are a lightweight window](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m21s)

[that dismiss when you click away from](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m23s)

[them](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m25s)

[i think that would make all the](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m27s)

[difference](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m28s)

[okay cool i i think i i think i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m32s)

[like that idea](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m35s)

[so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m37s)

[i think with that what i'm going to do](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m38s)

[is i'm going to say thank you everyone](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m40s)

[for](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m42s)

[coming and hanging out](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m42s)

[i will drop a link in the chat again if](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m44s)

[you are interested in the user group](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m46s)

[meetups um i highly recommend great way](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m49s)

[to learn more and sharpen your skills](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m52s)

[if you're in the spokane area great way](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m55s)

[to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m57s)

[meet other developers if you aren't i'd](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h05m58s)

[encourage you to at least look up](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m00s)

[user group meetings in your area chances](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m02s)

[are there are probably some around there](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m04s)

[it is always a good way to network with](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m06s)

[local companies in the area you never](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m09s)

[know when it might lead to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m11s)

[new job opportunities](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m13s)

[in being in the spokane area my company](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m20s)

[isn't is hiring](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m22s)

[here real quick i'll grab the link i've](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m24s)

[so if](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m28s)

[you are out there and you are interested](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m31s)

[in doing it](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m33s)

[i will grab the link at a later point so](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m37s)

[it is there is a normally a careers page](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m39s)

[buried underneath intellitech.com](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m41s)

[apparently somebody's doing maintenance](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m44s)

[on the site right now so i am unable to](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m46s)

[actually grab it it's like careers i](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m48s)

[think at the top so but if you are](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m50s)

[interested we are hiring for a variety](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m52s)

[of positions including](https://youtu.be/a0cM1Nm9hS4?t=02h06m54s)
