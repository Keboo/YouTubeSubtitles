[hello everyone welcome back uh tonight I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m01s)

[figured I'm going to dive back into the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m04s)

[material design and xaml stuff uh want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m06s)

[to poke at the 5-0 stuff I've done a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m08s)

[little work on it the last uh week or so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m10s)

[hacking on the new theme Russians](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m12s)

[brushes stuff doing some code generation](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m15s)

[with that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m18s)

[um would like to get it close to the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m19s)

[point where the 5-0 branch is gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m20s)

[possibly going to merge I have a four](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m23s)

[nine Milestone sitting in the repo right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m26s)

[now kind of as a placeholder I wasn't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m28s)

[real sure whether there was going to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m30s)

[a four nine release or whether we were](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m31s)

[just gonna hold off and all of that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m33s)

[stuff was gonna make it into 5-0 so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m35s)

[still on the fence we're gonna see how](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m38s)

[far we get see how it goes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m43s)

[real quick before we get before we get](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m44s)

[too too deep into it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m46s)

[let's jump real quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m48s)

[so tonight's brain teaser for anybody](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m50s)

[who didn't catch the uh the image up on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m52s)

[the the pre-roll](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m55s)

[it's a very simple one there's a test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h00m57s)

[there are only three lines in this test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m00s)

[the goal is to make this test both](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m04s)

[compile and pass but you are not allowed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m06s)

[to edit the test in any way](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m09s)

[so that's the task](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m12s)

[it's rather fun it's rather it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m15s)

[exciting](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m17s)

[um it absolutely abuses](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m19s)

[um some of the async and weight stuff if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m23s)

[you haven't figured that out just from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m24s)

[kind of the the fun syntax here of how](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m25s)

[it goes but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m28s)

[and as the assert equals implies this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m29s)

[probably not something you should do in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m33s)

[your production app this is a learning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m35s)

[experience not a a guiding software](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m37s)

[principle so for what it's worth there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m41s)

[let's jump back over oh I also wanted to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m44s)

[show this off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m47s)

[um last Thursday uh Stephen Taub posted](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m49s)

[a absolutely](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m53s)

[amazing blog post now there's a general](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m56s)

[rule of thumb when you're writing blog](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h01m59s)

[posts and I don't remember what it is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m01s)

[like two thousand twenty five hundred](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m03s)

[words somewhere in that range is once](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m04s)

[you get over a certain length your](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m07s)

[viewership drops off right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m09s)

[um because if people wanted to read a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m12s)

[book they'd read a book blogs are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m14s)

[generally not considered to be overly](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m16s)

[long](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m18s)

[um you can tell by the little scroll bar](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m20s)

[up here uh yeah this is a long uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m22s)

[yeah so this is this is not for the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m28s)

[faint of heart](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m31s)

[um but if you are interested in knowing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m32s)

[about how async and gonna wait really](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m34s)

[works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m38s)

[Steven is potentially one of the best](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m39s)

[people to learn it from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m42s)

[um and this write-up that he has done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m44s)

[here is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m46s)

[excellent absolutely excellent the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m47s)

[answer to tonight's brain teaser is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m50s)

[technically inside of this blog post but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m53s)

[yeah it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m56s)

[I won't tell you where but it is in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h02m59s)

[there somewhere](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m01s)

[yeah it's it's a very long](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m06s)

[take it in chunks but if you really want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m06s)

[to dive into the inner workings and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m08s)

[understand how how it goes um he does a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m10s)

[really amazing job at kind of breaking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m13s)

[down the history of how did we get to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m16s)

[where we are today](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m19s)

[um why did we get there and then how it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m20s)

[works under the hood it is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m22s)

[absolute goal](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m25s)

[absolute goal okay so material design](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m27s)

[and xaml stuff uh that is oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m31s)

[I suppose I could do this uh if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m35s)

[is there not an open branch on oh I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m39s)

[guess I can do it over here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m41s)

[wait for anything](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m44s)

[there's an open on GitHub where is it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m47s)

[or is it delete open](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m51s)

[I want to open in browser I guess I have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m54s)

[to go up to the origin](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m57s)

[if you go on GitHub so if anybody does](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h03m58s)

[want to go and play with it I have not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m00s)

[pushed the solution Branch for it yet so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m03s)

[that's to be determined or that will be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m07s)

[pushed in a little bit it's sitting](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m09s)

[right there it's just it's just hanging](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m11s)

[out it's waiting it's waiting](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m12s)

[uh okay oh and I may go fix my.net](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m16s)

[templates](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m19s)

[I found a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m21s)

[arguably a bug with them earlier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m22s)

[today and I logged an issue to go back](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m25s)

[and fix it and haven't done it yet uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m27s)

[anyway okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m30s)

[color thoughts so there is a for those](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m31s)

[people who are unfamiliar there is a 5-0](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m35s)

[Branch sitting out on the repo it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m37s)

[contains right now basically a bunch of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m39s)

[removal stuff that that's out there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m42s)

[um and then I started slapping in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m46s)

[uh on top of it this color thoughts of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m49s)

[how are we going to do the new theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m52s)

[brush stuff and I think I I think we've](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m54s)

[narrowed it down I I think I think we've](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m56s)

[got a good path forward so a couple](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h04m59s)

[things a couple things a couple things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m02s)

[one the the goal is to maintain the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m05s)

[Simplicity of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m09s)

[uh of the app as well as to give people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m12s)

[uh an easy migration path forward so we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m15s)

[want things like the bundled theme to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m18s)

[continue to work I want things like the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m21s)

[custom color theme to continue to work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m23s)

[um but I also want to allow people to if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m26s)

[they want to set their their theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m29s)

[brushes this way to have this work as](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m31s)

[well the other thing that we are doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m33s)

[because I am intending to rename](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m36s)

[I think every single brush in the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m39s)

[library now for some people you may not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m42s)

[care](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m45s)

[right if you're just using the Styles](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m46s)

[and you don't have a lot of like Dynamic](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m48s)

[resources pointed at the brushes you're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m49s)

[golden this won't affect you don't worry](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m52s)

[about it but if you've referenced like a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m55s)

[bunch of the old ones what uh the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h05m58s)

[compromise that I'm doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m01s)

[is I've got this guy here is if you want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m03s)

[to have both the old brushes and the new](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m07s)

[brushes loaded into your app so that you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m09s)

[don't or so that you can slowly work on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m11s)

[migration this will be an option for you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m14s)

[at some point this will probably go away](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m21s)

[but it's not a terror it's not a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m22s)

[terribly difficult thing for me to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m25s)

[support for now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m27s)

[so we're going to leave it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m30s)

[so it's worth noting the the underlying](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m31s)

[stuff in the library is going to use all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m35s)

[the new brushes this is only needed for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m37s)

[your dynamic or static resources inside](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m41s)

[of your apps so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m43s)

[um that will be the I figure a one-liner](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m45s)

[in the update notes for the the 5.0](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m48s)

[release is probably not terrible for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m51s)

[people to do like it's a major release](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m54s)

[there's braking changes we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m57s)

[intentionally deleting a lot of old](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h06m59s)

[obsolete members that kind of thing like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m00s)

[there is there is going to be some](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m02s)

[renames and breakages that occur but I I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m03s)

[figured I can at least one document them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m06s)

[well because most of them are simple](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m09s)

[renames](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m10s)

[that should be straight fine and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m11s)

[replaces but then I realize brushes are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m13s)

[a major pain to deal with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m16s)

[um I will leave both the mapping up so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m19s)

[if people want to do a find and replace](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m21s)

[or I'll leave this in in so that it can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m22s)

[go through and work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m25s)

[how we are actually going to do the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m27s)

[generation then is we've got this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m29s)

[resource gen thing and I have started](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m31s)

[building out this and I think I did this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m34s)

[a few weeks ago on a prior stream there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m37s)

[is this theme colors.json file and I I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m39s)

[need to do a little Cleanup in here but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m43s)

[the basic premise is this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m45s)

[is that we will have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m48s)

[all of the brushes inside of here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m50s)

[declared like this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m54s)

[and they'll be declared with so they get](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m56s)

[a name they have alternate keys because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h07m58s)

[oftentimes even though we may want a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m02s)

[whole bunch of distinct brushes at the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m04s)

[end of the day](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m06s)

[even though we may have a bunch of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m07s)

[distinct brushes those are there for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m09s)

[customization points not necessarily](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m11s)

[because the library is going to Define](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m13s)

[85 different colors right those are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m14s)

[there for if you say hey I want all my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m17s)

[card backgrounds to be to to use this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m19s)

[alternate thing great like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m23s)

[the library is basically going to use](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m25s)

[the one but these are extension points](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m27s)

[that we can add in new brushes later](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m29s)

[that kind of thing but these are going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m31s)

[to be the defaults](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m33s)

[all right the other thing they could do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m34s)

[is they could just be hard-coded RGB](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m36s)

[codes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m38s)

[so simple easy but you'll note they also](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m39s)

[have this obsolete keys so that I can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m42s)

[generate what goes into that obsolete](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m44s)

[dictionary so if we add stuff remove](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m46s)

[stuff hopefully this works for going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m48s)

[forward to try to give people a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m50s)

[backboarding way of uh catching up to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m52s)

[things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m55s)

[um the when we run this guy and so let's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h08m57s)

[set startup project here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m01s)

[uh so the other thing I did and this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m03s)

[something I think people should be aware](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m07s)

[of uh so inside of your c-sharp projects](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m09s)

[you can always do these launch](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m12s)

[settings.json files you don't have to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m14s)

[remember how to create them uh if you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m16s)

[just right click and go to properties](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m18s)

[under debug](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m23s)

[you can hit up open this open launch](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m25s)

[profiles and you can actually just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m27s)

[Define them here when you define these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m29s)

[you'll see the launch settings.json file](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m31s)

[pop up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m33s)

[and start filling in this information](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m34s)

[but for people who prefer to work in a a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m37s)

[GUI rather than remembering Json schema](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m39s)

[syntax and how to do all this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m43s)

[it's a nice easy way to get here so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m45s)

[right click project properties debug](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m47s)

[open debug launch profiles UI so easy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m49s)

[way to get in but I've defined up a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m53s)

[bunch of just command line arcs so I can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m56s)

[easily change this drop down from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h09m58s)

[generate brushes swatches icons all that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m00s)

[stuff boom easy mode so if we run the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m02s)

[generate brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m05s)

[it might take a moment since I just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m08s)

[switched into this branch](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m10s)

[so even before I could drag it over the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m12s)

[thing was done great so what has it done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m14s)

[and it probably needs some logging](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m17s)

[output there's a whole bunch of stuff in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m19s)

[here I want to clean up a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m20s)

[stuff whole bunch of cleanup to do a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m22s)

[whole bunch of cleanup uh but it ginned](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m24s)

[a whole bunch of files for me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m27s)

[so files that it generated so inside of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m29s)

[here uh it it is going to have generated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m32s)

[by](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m35s)

[well one the obsolete brushes so it gens](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m37s)

[up this for me which is great ignore all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m40s)

[the squiggles](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m44s)

[so this is this is built in forwarding](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m46s)

[appropriately wonderful that's what we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m49s)

[want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m50s)

[um it gens up my where's the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m52s)

[it ends up the dark and light uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m56s)

[resource dictionaries for me perfect](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h10m59s)

[that's what we want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m01s)

[um it creates uh underneath](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m03s)

[uh is it here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m07s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m11s)

[so it creates this file here for this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m13s)

[theme class and this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m17s)

[breaking API change because right now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m19s)

[um the object that you get back used to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m22s)

[be an eye theme the I theme is gone this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m25s)

[is a uh a partial class and this this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m28s)

[part is probably familiar to some people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m32s)

[where there's a base theme and a dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m34s)

[theme I might even go as far as to whack](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m35s)

[the eye base theme this interface may](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m38s)

[die too these I these interfaces aren't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m40s)

[providing a lot of value and I'm just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m42s)

[I'm axing them wherever wherever](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m44s)

[possible](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m48s)

[yeah I don't know I don't think it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m51s)

[actually providing a lot of value we may](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m53s)

[end up asking that as well but the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m55s)

[important part is this half of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h11m58s)

[partial](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m00s)

[is with all of the colors in it is auto](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m02s)

[generated you'll note it populates out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m05s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m08s)

[I have a a subclass here for card](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m10s)

[background so this this same uh where is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m12s)

[it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m17s)

[yeah so this key here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m18s)

[it goes through and strips off the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m21s)

[prefix knows that I want a card class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m22s)

[knows that I want a background property](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m25s)

[inside of that so it goes through and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m26s)

[goes I got you there's your card class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m28s)

[there's your background property](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m30s)

[um leverages humanizer to pluralize it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m33s)

[so that you know check boxes yes rather](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m35s)

[than just slapping an s on the end of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m39s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m40s)

[so that all of this kind of flows nicely](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m41s)

[all the way through here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m44s)

[that way when you go through and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m46s)

[retrieve out one of these objects all of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m47s)

[these things are populated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m50s)

[the the palette helper is probably about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m51s)

[to die next](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m55s)

[or it's one of the things that's about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m57s)

[to die but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h12m58s)

[and I think it's going to die it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m01s)

[mostly going to be a rename I think but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m03s)

[the the get theme and set theme methods](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m05s)

[that exist in here I need to clean up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m08s)

[some of this because some of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m10s)

[doesn't need to to still exist](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m11s)

[but a good portion of this down here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m14s)

[you'll note is doing the load theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m17s)

[colors which is a once again a partial](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m18s)

[method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m21s)

[if we actually jump to the other half of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m22s)

[it you can see that it's generated out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m25s)

[all of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m27s)

[the the loading of the colors out of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m29s)

[resource dictionary and it's also](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m32s)

[populated it with fallback choices so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m34s)

[it's going to first look for something](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m37s)

[that contains background then it's going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m39s)

[to fall back to some of the old keys and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m41s)

[go hunting for them so which makes it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m43s)

[much cleaner uh in terms of trying to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m45s)

[deal with all of this stuff that way I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m49s)

[don't have to I don't have to think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m51s)

[quite as hard as I used to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m53s)

[and in theory this should be somewhat](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m55s)

[backwards compatible I I think it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m57s)

[really unlikely we're going to run into](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h13m59s)

[a situation where somebody's defined](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m01s)

[their own but I figured if I'm Auto](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m02s)

[generating this I can be as as crazy as](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m04s)

[I want to be and then this guy here is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m06s)

[the the same thing so the apply theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m09s)

[colors is Now setting those brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m11s)

[which feeds us back over here all the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m15s)

[same all the same stuff that existed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m16s)

[before](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m18s)

[I am noticing it's slapping color here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m20s)

[and I'm wondering if this should be dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m22s)

[color now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m24s)

[good question I'm wondering how valuable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m28s)

[it is to even slap the color in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m30s)

[we'll consider it I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m40s)

[this may just be adding noise that isn't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m43s)

[necessary the other thing is this causes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m45s)

[a boxing operation every time because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m47s)

[color is a struck](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m49s)

[I'm not too concerned about it because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m51s)

[we're already slapping stuff in and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m53s)

[this isn't the point of contention but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m56s)

[palette helper is probably going to get](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m58s)

[renamed into something a little bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h14m59s)

[cleaner since it's more like a theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m01s)

[manager at this point we do have a theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m02s)

[manager](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m05s)

[um I'm trying to be cautious uh as well](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m06s)

[of the control ZX library because a lot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m09s)

[of their naming overlaps](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m12s)

[with what I'm doing here and I don't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m14s)

[want to collide I did look at what they](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m16s)

[were doing and came to the conclusion](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m19s)

[that it wasn't quite what I wanted it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m20s)

[wasn't quite there so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m23s)

[we're going this route](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m26s)

[For Better or Worse we're going this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m28s)

[route](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m29s)

[uh um yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m30s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m35s)

[so there's that there's that okay and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m37s)

[then I decided I'm already in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m40s)

[generating code let's generate the test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m42s)

[too because why not right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m44s)

[for if we're gonna we're already gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m47s)

[have the the thing generated Let's test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m48s)

[this thing to make sure that it works so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m51s)

[down inside of here naturally I once](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m53s)

[again the um being able to abuse partial](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m56s)

[classes is so wonderful](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h15m59s)

[um I built up a little a little helper](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m01s)

[here so normally inside of this uh UI](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m04s)

[test where we use xaml test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m08s)

[this guy has a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m10s)

[a bunch of stuff uh in the the base](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m13s)

[class for doing the initialization so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m16s)

[it's got these nice helpers I've written](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m19s)

[for you know init your tests with the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m21s)

[material design Library](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m23s)

[go ahead and start up a new window with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m25s)

[some basic xaml it'll wrap it up all in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m27s)

[the nice stuff for you you know load it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m30s)

[up create a window with a user control](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m33s)

[all like it's very convenient the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m34s)

[problem is is these tests I don't want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m37s)

[any of that right I'm I'm intentionally](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m39s)

[trying to test the the app.xaml portion](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m41s)

[of it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m44s)

[so what I did here is I was like well](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m45s)

[what I'd really like to do is I'd like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m48s)

[to do an initialize and feed in the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m50s)

[various](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m53s)

[um resource dictionaries to start](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m54s)

[and say okay here's here's what we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m57s)

[looking to get right we we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h16m59s)

[verify that bundle theme works so this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m01s)

[is one test I'm anticipating writing out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m03s)

[one for each of those other cases](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m06s)

[including the obsolete brushes just to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m08s)

[say hey let's make sure all of these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m10s)

[things work but then the important part](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m12s)

[I'll write out the condition right but I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m14s)

[don't want to go through an assert on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m17s)

[every single brush that sounds like work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m18s)

[and why should I work when I've got](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m20s)

[something that's willing to write code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m22s)

[for me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m24s)

[so naturally what I did is I was like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m25s)

[well what I'd really like it to do is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m27s)

[generate a large block of xaml that's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m29s)

[some blind text blocks](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m32s)

[and I cleaned up the text on them a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m34s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m36s)

[um and I intentionally use static](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m37s)

[resources here generally you want to use](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m40s)

[Dynamic resources for anything that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m42s)

[could change at runtime your theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m43s)

[brushes if you're going to allow](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m45s)

[um your theme to change dynamically you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m48s)

[need to use Dynamic resource not static](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m51s)

[but in this case I intentionally am](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m53s)

[looking to cause failures if the brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m55s)

[doesn't exist and this already caught](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h17m58s)

[some some issues for me just as I was](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m00s)

[writing this first test to get it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m01s)

[working so this generates up the the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m03s)

[wrap panel which is what gets uh passed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m07s)

[in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m11s)

[where was it inside of initialize so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m12s)

[that that big wrap panel gets fed into](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m15s)

[this and I wrap it up inside of uh an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m17s)

[initialize so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m20s)

[I do the theme dictionary inside of an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m22s)

[app.zamo bit and then that wrap panel](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m24s)

[goes inside of a window](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m27s)

[and then for the assert all theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m29s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m31s)

[I just did this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m32s)

[right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m34s)

[and I ran through it why is this thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m36s)

[unhappy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m37s)

[oh interesting it knows that this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m39s)

[auto-generated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m42s)

[and it's squawking because I flagged it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m43s)

[as nullable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m46s)

[that's a good okay let's fix that real](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m47s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m50s)

[um but so this is something people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m52s)

[sometimes forget about scoping in C](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m54s)

[sharp is roughly between your enclosing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m57s)

[curly braces that's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h18m59s)

[not a Perfect Analogy but it's close](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m02s)

[right uh in a lot of cases the scoping](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m05s)

[of the variables between the curly](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m07s)

[braces and you can arbitrarily just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m09s)

[introduce scope](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m10s)

[and I didn't want to think about reusing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m13s)

[things and it was especially when](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m15s)

[generating code this was really easy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m17s)

[I could have refactored it into a method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m20s)

[that was easy we did that so I just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m25s)

[ripped through that and said you know](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m28s)

[what we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m30s)

[and so all it does is it goes and hunts](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m32s)

[out the the text block whose text](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m34s)

[property matches the the thing here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m36s)

[it pulls the app resource from that key](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m39s)

[and says Okay I want to verify that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m42s)

[these things match it should probably](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m44s)

[also have an assert](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m46s)

[this should probably be an assert](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m48s)

[not null here on brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m51s)

[I think it should probably assert that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m57s)

[the brush is found let's let's clean](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h19m59s)

[these both of them up real quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m00s)

[okay so so this thing in here it's got a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m02s)

[whole bunch of stuff oh I should put](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m07s)

[this header on that file too so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m11s)

[this guy here generate brushes async is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m12s)

[the entry point and then it just calls a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m16s)

[bunch of other things so generate theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m17s)

[brushes test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m19s)

[um and I think we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m21s)

[and we're gonna do this and we're gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m25s)

[do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m27s)

[this guy and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m28s)

[what did I call it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m31s)

[uh generated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m33s)

[header boom slap that in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m35s)

[and then we want to turn on null ability](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m39s)

[so I want to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m42s)

[hey copilot turn on null ability](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m44s)

[I'm still convinced copilot can listen](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m47s)

[listen to me uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m49s)

[uh there was a whole bunch of cool](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m52s)

[GitHub copilot stuff that got announced](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m54s)

[I think earlier today](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m56s)

[it's like copilot chat](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h20m57s)

[what's up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m00s)

[I was seeing I was seeing uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m03s)

[uh uh GitHub](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m13s)

[yeah this thing I was seeing a bunch of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m19s)

[chatter about it and I haven't actually](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m22s)

[I haven't had a chance to play around](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m24s)

[and try it yet](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m26s)

[it looks kind of cool it look because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m27s)

[since chat GPT came out I usually have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m31s)

[either](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m34s)

[um chat GPT open or I will just use the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m36s)

[the new Bing chat here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m39s)

[at](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m42s)

[this is why I'm convinced that it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m46s)

[listening to me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m48s)

[see that see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m50s)

[now admittedly it's not a rocket](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m54s)

[scientist for it to realize when I pop](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m56s)

[this open that this is the tab I'm of it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h21m58s)

[still](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m00s)

[it is spookly accurate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m06s)

[but it's one of those it's like oh yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m09s)

[summarize this for me done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m11s)

[I can't decide if I hate this button or](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m14s)

[love it I'm leaning on the love it side](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m16s)

[I'm leaning there I've seen a lot of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m20s)

[people hate it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m22s)

[but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m23s)

[here if anybody's interested in checking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m25s)

[like I said I haven't actually had time](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m27s)

[to play or use it yet but it looks](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m30s)

[really slick and it bare minimum sign up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m32s)

[for private preview that sounds like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m35s)

[something I want to save for later](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m37s)

[that sounds exactly like something I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m39s)

[want to say for later](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m41s)

[okay nullable enable blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m43s)

[blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m45s)

[great okay send me some brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m48s)

[okay and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m53s)

[there we go so that goes away oh I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m56s)

[forgot the assert not null](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h22m57s)

[excuse me okay so let's go back here to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m02s)

[do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m06s)

[I may have gotten a little crazy with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m09s)

[some of my variables](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m10s)

[I wanted to be able to customize my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m12s)

[indent randomly and I probably should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m14s)

[have just hard-coded it and called it a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m16s)

[day but you know what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m17s)

[I was paranoid at one point uh okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m20s)

[so I wanted to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m24s)

[thank you for helping me with my indent](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m27s)

[now knock it off uh let's see we want an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m29s)

[assert not null](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m31s)

[hey razor God's fire away with the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m37s)

[question](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m39s)

[okay so we'll put that in put that in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m43s)

[Regen](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m47s)

[should I use Linux or Windows uh a very](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m49s)

[loaded question](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m54s)

[I think I'll say it depends on what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m55s)

[you're doing there uh are you talking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m57s)

[for like development General use](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h23m59s)

[because there's there's pros and cons to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m06s)

[both of them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m08s)

[um I mean you can see here I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m10s)

[playing in a Windows environment right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m12s)

[now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m16s)

[but there are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m17s)

[I can't say windows is the perfect](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m20s)

[solution for everything it's a good](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m22s)

[solution for a lot so it's a lot's going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m24s)

[to depend on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m26s)

[what you're trying to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m28s)

[for example there there's a lot of Dev](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m31s)

[tools](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m32s)

[um that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m34s)

[are just really written and built around](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m36s)

[Linux type stuff there's a lot of repos](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m39s)

[that have bash scripts and whatnot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m41s)

[Windows does have the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m44s)

[um the windows subsystem for Linux so if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m47s)

[you play in Windows you can drop into a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m48s)

[Linux terminal which for a lot of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m51s)

[development tasks is all you need](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m57s)

[with that said there there's other](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h24m59s)

[things that are nice about it like the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m01s)

[Ubuntu stuff for like uh build agents](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m03s)

[and whatnot just run circles around](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m06s)

[windows just absolute circles and a lot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m08s)

[of it's the difference because one's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m11s)

[really heavy weight the other's not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m12s)

[but Windows does a lot of features](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m14s)

[so I like I said a lot of it'll depend](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m19s)

[on on on what you're wanting to do if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m22s)

[you're deving I think it depends uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m24s)

[teach myself how to code program like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m27s)

[database stuff I don't know some](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m28s)

[um a little of everything okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m32s)

[so one more question then so learning to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m34s)

[code what do you want to what do you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m38s)

[want to code like a lot of people will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m40s)

[start off with asking like what language](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m42s)

[you want to work in or what framework](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m44s)

[my usual recommendation to people is to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m47s)

[say](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m49s)

[come up with uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m50s)

[a little project or something that you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m52s)

[want to build yourself](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m57s)

[and then and then and then work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h25m58s)

[backwards from there because I found](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m00s)

[that when people want to learn something](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m02s)

[they're a lot more motivated uh to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m04s)

[actually get it done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m07s)

[for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m09s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m11s)

[my personal preference is uh C sharp but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m13s)

[I'm heavily biased so take that with a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m16s)

[the big a big grain of salt](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m18s)

[oh oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m20s)

[created](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m23s)

[sorry](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m24s)

[Shameless self-promotion Shameless](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m25s)

[Shameless self-promotion](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m27s)

[I have to show thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m29s)

[I teased this like three months ago](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m36s)

[on the note of learning if anybody is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m39s)

[interested in learning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m41s)

[C sharp the essential C sharp book](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m43s)

[series uh by Mark Michaelis uh and hey](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m46s)

[look that's me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m50s)

[um has been moving online so I I will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m51s)

[warn you not all of the chapters have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m56s)

[been updated through C sharp 11.](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h26m59s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m01s)

[some of the content doesn't have latest](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m03s)

[language features added into it yet but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m05s)

[this is a a work in progress we have put](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m07s)

[way too many development hours into a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m11s)

[pipeline process so that we can go from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m16s)

[editor copy editor](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m19s)

[publish out to site like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m22s)

[the number of hours that have gone into](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m24s)

[this is astronomical](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m26s)

[um I I think if we realized how big it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m29s)

[was going to be we might not have bitten](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m31s)

[it off at the beginning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m32s)

[but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m34s)

[um there is all of this stuff in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m35s)

[very much uh feedback welcome you'll](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m37s)

[know the the feedback button ends up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m40s)

[taking you just to the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m42s)

[um the repository](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m44s)

[um the the repository for the website](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m46s)

[contains the the shell of the website](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m49s)

[but it doesn't actually contain the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m51s)

[content so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m53s)

[due to various contractual rules](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m55s)

[um the content even though it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h27m59s)

[available for free on the website](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m01s)

[is somewhat set up in a way that makes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m03s)

[it somewhat difficult if you were trying](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m05s)

[to download everything](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m07s)

[um just due to publisher restrictions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m09s)

[and whatnot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m11s)

[but if if the the website what we've set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m13s)

[up here the like I said the shell of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m17s)

[website](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m19s)

[without the content](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m21s)

[is an open source repo and feedback and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m22s)

[everything is very welcome](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m25s)

[um we have a backlog that's sitting on a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m28s)

[private repo](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m30s)

[um and this repo may end up moving](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m32s)

[I think we were going to relocate it one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m34s)

[more time we've moved this repo around](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m36s)

[like three or four times we've got too](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m38s)

[many orgs we're dealing with but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m39s)

[regardless essentialcsharp.com will stay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m41s)

[fixed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m44s)

[um and the feedback button will always](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m45s)

[point to where you should go so if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m47s)

[anything if the repo moves again don't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m49s)

[panic](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m51s)

[you may not want to Fork it yet I'll](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m53s)

[just say that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m56s)

[um but if you're interested in learning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h28m58s)

[C sharp uh there is a ton of great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m00s)

[information again I am a heavily biased](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m03s)

[Source I'm one of the tech editors so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m06s)

[yeah I'm I'm biased](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m10s)

[um but we have we have a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m13s)

[coming](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m15s)

[um and at some point we do want to get a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m16s)

[uh client-side compiler setup similar to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m18s)

[how like on the Microsoft learn docs you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m21s)

[can have like the run my c-sharp snippet](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m23s)

[right here in the browser](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m25s)

[we've got a proof of concept of that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m26s)

[done and we would like to get that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m28s)

[plugged in here as well and all kinds of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m29s)

[stuff so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m32s)

[stuff is coming stuff is going things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m34s)

[are changing rapidly on this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m36s)

[we've got a small team of people working](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m39s)

[on things so again if you're interested](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m41s)

[in learning C sharp I definitely](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m44s)

[recommend this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m45s)

[um if you are learning so going back to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m47s)

[your question uh Razer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m51s)

[um as far as what you should use](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m53s)

[what I would say is find a project that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m56s)

[you want to work on or an idea of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h29m58s)

[something that you want to build](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m00s)

[um I would use that to let it drive kind](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m02s)

[of what language uh and framework type](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m05s)

[stuff that you want to use if you end up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m08s)

[picking C sharp I recommend Windows](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m09s)

[because most of the tools that have been](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m12s)

[around for c-sharp started like even](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m15s)

[though C sharp is cross-platform you can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m17s)

[run it on Mac Windows Linux whatever](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m19s)

[um the tooling support has in for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m23s)

[Windows has been around longer so it has](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m25s)

[more maturity](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m27s)

[with that said people use vs code to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m29s)

[like I've got colleagues that use it for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m31s)

[their day job and do just fine I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m33s)

[personally like all of the fancy stuff](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m36s)

[that's in Visual Studio that's a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m38s)

[preference there's also things like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m40s)

[jetbrains writer that is another tooling](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m42s)

[option that runs](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m45s)

[um cross-plat for like uh I don't know](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m47s)

[if they have a Linux Port but I know it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m51s)

[runs on at least Mac and windows and I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m52s)

[have a bunch of colleagues that love](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m55s)

[that as well so start with a project](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m56s)

[that you like let that guide uh kind of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h30m58s)

[the the framework Tech stack that you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m01s)

[want to to build out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m03s)

[um people will have a lot of opinions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m05s)

[about what language people should learn](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m07s)

[first uh my opinion is you should pick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m09s)

[one of the big ones like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m12s)

[one one of the big popular ones and go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m15s)

[from there now what's big and popular is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m17s)

[a little bit debatable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m19s)

[um but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m23s)

[protect overflow](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m24s)

[survey 2022. when in doubt this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m28s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m32s)

[there's ever a question of what's what's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m35s)

[big and popular](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m37s)

[any anything that lands](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m39s)

[anything that lands on this list this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m41s)

[like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m43s)

[if you get down if you get down below](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m44s)

[like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m47s)

[I would tell you to stay out of probably](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m50s)

[the single digits of percentages kotlin](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m52s)

[and rust are probably okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m58s)

[once you start getting further down](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h31m59s)

[things things start to get a little more](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m01s)

[interesting if you decide that you want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m03s)

[to build iOS apps obviously Swift is a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m04s)

[very reasonable choice so sometimes you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m07s)

[got to take a little bit of this with a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m09s)

[grain of salt because this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m10s)

[this is Technologies without regard for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m12s)

[Target platform or what you're building](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m16s)

[but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m18s)

[something in the something in the top](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m20s)

[part of this is probably reasonable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m22s)

[um as far as starting to learn stuff for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m25s)

[things like database](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m27s)

[um the two big options are going to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m29s)

[either a SQL based one or a a nosql](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m36s)

[as basically the two options I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m37s)

[like if you go nosql [ __ ] is going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m40s)

[be quite popular](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m43s)

[um as an option](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m45s)

[uh in the net Tech stack we usually go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m47s)

[with like uh Cosmos DB](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m49s)

[um so I I don't know if that's helpful I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m53s)

[I hope that is but that's usually what I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m55s)

[I would tell people again if you ask me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m57s)

[to recommend something I'm going to tell](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h32m59s)

[you to pick Windows pick C sharp](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h33m01s)

[um and for your database I would tell](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h33m04s)

[you to use Entity framework core back it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h33m07s)

[a reasonable resource to take a look at](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h33m34s)

[they might just be pushing for Cosmos](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m08s)

[Cosmos I will warn you too if you're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m10s)

[looking to learn database stuff Cosmos](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m13s)

[is a funny one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m15s)

[um because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m16s)

[um it can unlike a lot of databases it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m18s)

[it can take different front ends and so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m21s)

[you can set Cosmos up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m23s)

[to run in SQL you can have it run and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m25s)

[talk to it with [ __ ] and so it's kind](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m28s)

[of this weird thing where you can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m31s)

[interact with it in a bunch of different](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m32s)

[languages so it's it gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m33s)

[it's one of those it is a global scale](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m36s)

[database it is a nosql database but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m39s)

[again you can talk to it with a SQL](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m41s)

[front end](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m43s)

[so that your code doesn't necessarily](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m44s)

[have to think too hard about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m46s)

[you know changing my mindset out of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m51s)

[nosql in the SQL](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m55s)

[hopefully all of that's helpful like I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m57s)

[said happy to help guide if if you've](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h35m59s)

[got more specifics like I said if if you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m01s)

[were to ask me to just blindly recommend](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m04s)

[something uh that would be the uh path I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m05s)

[would head down](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m09s)

[okay so there's the test there's that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m15s)

[I think that it that gets me back to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m16s)

[where I wanted to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m18s)

[theme tests this is all generated that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m21s)

[looks better](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m24s)

[I think I want to run this test really](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m26s)

[quick just to make sure it passes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m28s)

[it passed the last time I ran it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m31s)

[from my test window go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m34s)

[my test window launched and I saw it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m36s)

[Flash and then it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m37s)

[it's over there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m40s)

[this window](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m45s)

[stay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m46s)

[this is the this is the problem I have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m49s)

[multiple monitors and occasionally I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m51s)

[lose things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m53s)

[okay so that worked](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h36m59s)

[it does mildly concern me that my test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m01s)

[may be wrong because all of the uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m04s)

[the colors all appeared black](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m11s)

[but I can see it ran through all of them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m19s)

[pulled them all out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m21s)

[did the checks on all of them so it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m24s)

[I might want to just pause it and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m29s)

[we're going to pause it real quick and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m33s)

[just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m35s)

[uh turn off the debugger](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m36s)

[so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m42s)

[we're gonna do a little little test here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m43s)

[with Snoop just just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m46s)

[it's not that I don't trust my own work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m48s)

[I just don't trust my own work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m50s)

[okay so this guy should fire up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m54s)

[boom hit my break point good okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h37m57s)

[that's paused at the break point and now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m00s)

[we take Snoop and we go hey Snoop](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m02s)

[because the fact that I see one red](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m05s)

[rectangle and no other rectangles kind](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m07s)

[of worries me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m09s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m11s)

[background](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m13s)

[yeah see that's what concerns me is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m24s)

[every single one of these things is the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m26s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m29s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m30s)

[so it launched](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m33s)

[attack](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m35s)

[that's not good](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m37s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m39s)

[that's not what that's supposed to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m47s)

[okay so the other thing we can do is we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m50s)

[can come up here and we can go a little](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m52s)

[a little spelunking through the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m54s)

[resources](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m55s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m57s)

[this is a wonderful thing in Snoop so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h38m58s)

[you can actually grab the uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m00s)

[that was weird](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m05s)

[that was very weird](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m07s)

[oh it's it's sitting on top oh it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m11s)

[topmost that's why it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m13s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m15s)

[Snoop](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m17s)

[uh hang on let me turn off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m18s)

[where is the enable topmost](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m24s)

[uh save and close](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m29s)

[think that gets it to be not topmost](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m34s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m36s)

[okay that's not quite what I wanted but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m40s)

[okay we'll go with it we'll go with it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m43s)

[um you can use there we go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m46s)

[you can use the application tab here to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m49s)

[then go hunting through all of your](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m51s)

[resource dictionaries that got loaded in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m53s)

[so you can see that this first one here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m54s)

[has 151 resources and then there's the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h39m57s)

[generic and the default so these ones](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m00s)

[are all of our Styles and whatnot this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m02s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m04s)

[has the interesting bits](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m05s)

[so for example this thing is set up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m08s)

[um and I want to see your color property](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m14s)

[okay that's non-zeros](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m17s)

[that's zeros that's zeros that's zeros](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m19s)

[so these brushes are all set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m21s)

[but they're all set to zeros](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m25s)

[okay and I think what we've said is that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m28s)

[these things shh we probably should add](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m31s)

[something to these tests to make sure](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m33s)

[that all these brushes aren't duplicated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m35s)

[values because that is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m36s)

[that is incorrect so that is not working](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m40s)

[despite so that so the problem one the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m44s)

[test is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m47s)

[going green when it really should be red](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m49s)

[so we should probably add something to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m51s)

[the test to make sure that it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m54s)

[uh guarante that it actually fails](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h40m56s)

[um I think what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m00s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m01s)

[um hash set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m03s)

[color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m05s)

[but I'll see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m06s)

[same colors gets new right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m09s)

[and then something like uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m13s)

[assert true](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m17s)

[scene colors add](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m20s)

[brush color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m24s)

[all right so the add method on a hash](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m28s)

[Set uh returns a Bool indicating whether](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m30s)

[the item was added and because hash sets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m33s)

[go off of the hash code uh duplicate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m37s)

[values won't get added to them so they](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m40s)

[can be a great way to get yourself to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m42s)

[the distinct set they're also a great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m43s)

[way to check if something's there so if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m45s)

[this returns true it means the item or](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m49s)

[I'm sorry I have that backwards](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m51s)

[false if the item is already present](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m54s)

[all right so assert true that the item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m57s)

[was added okay we got it right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h41m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m02s)

[I think what we want to do then is add a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m03s)

[message that something along the lines](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m05s)

[of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m10s)

[uh contains a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m14s)

[duplicate theme color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m17s)

[uh add the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m21s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m24s)

[rush to the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m29s)

[uh what it What was the name of that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m33s)

[alter alternate keys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m36s)

[to the other](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m40s)

[uh brushes alternate keys and theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m44s)

[colors.json so I just like writing the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m49s)

[code like this so that I can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m52s)

[kind of get a grasp of what I'm writing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m54s)

[and then we go back over here to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h42m57s)

[let's see close close U](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m00s)

[H you uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m03s)

[uh so this is the we don't care about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m07s)

[the wrap panel one this is the method we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m10s)

[care about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m12s)

[is your what's being iterated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m14s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m18s)

[and this is where we want the assert](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m19s)

[and we want this guy to go here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m26s)

[and I want that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m30s)

[and then I want this guy to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m33s)

[the brushes.name](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m38s)

[that goes here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m41s)

[and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m47s)

[yeah the rest of that should be fine and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m51s)

[then we just need to add up above](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h43m53s)

[we want to do the double indent](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m00s)

[here and then we want to declare a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m04s)

[hash set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m09s)

[there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m12s)

[and then that should work okay send me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m15s)

[some new code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m18s)

[one of the other things I'm hoping to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m21s)

[get to is actually](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m24s)

[setting up some Ms build properties so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m26s)

[that these things I I don't I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m28s)

[still on the fence whether I should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m31s)

[check in these dot g files or whether I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m32s)

[should let them be autogen I kind of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m35s)

[leaning towards Auto gen](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m42s)

[it does make them harder to find on like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m44s)

[GitHub or something so it's like maybe I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m46s)

[should leave those in place](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m49s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m55s)

[okay so there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h44m59s)

[there's that let's go back to our](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m02s)

[test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m05s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m07s)

[okay so this test we're gonna turn off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m10s)

[this break point we're gonna just run it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m13s)

[because the test should now hit that a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m15s)

[certain fail so in general I like to see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m17s)

[my tests go red before making beating](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m19s)

[them into submission and having them go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m24s)

[green](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m25s)

[so in an ideal situation that's what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m29s)

[we're looking for Tess](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m31s)

[okay good and hopefully it airs with the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m33s)

[okay uh we should probably actually also](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m38s)

[add in the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m42s)

[the the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m44s)

[bad color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m45s)

[contains a duplicate theme color we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m47s)

[gonna put the the dupe value in here as](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m49s)

[well](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m52s)

[uh um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m54s)

[what's the easiest way to go and grab](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h45m57s)

[there's a way](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m04s)

[I think if I just do two string it works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m07s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m13s)

[we're gonna go here so this is where](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m16s)

[it's going to get weird we're inside of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m18s)

[a string literal with double uh dollar](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m20s)

[signs here to make the double curly](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m24s)

[braces our interpolated values and in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m27s)

[this case we want to actually have this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m29s)

[string](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m32s)

[itself be an interpolated string so this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m33s)

[actually is going to end up being](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m37s)

[that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m40s)

[it starts to get really fun when you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m46s)

[when you uh use these string literals to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m48s)

[write code that contains other string](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m51s)

[literals](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m53s)

[round and round and round you go okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m54s)

[that should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m57s)

[compiles good uh let's run it I just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h46m59s)

[want to look at the air](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m02s)

[this is one of those](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m04s)

[very rarely use skill sets of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m05s)

[uh writing good error log messages](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m09s)

[I was actually mentioning this to a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m13s)

[colleague the other day that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m15s)

[a prior employer that I worked at didn't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m17s)

[usually like to hire entry-level devs](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m20s)

[what they like to do is promote from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m21s)

[their QA and testing Department](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m24s)

[yeah that looks better](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m28s)

[um and promote them into the the dev](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m30s)

[roles because people who had had to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m32s)

[spend time uh looking at logs helping](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m35s)

[other people diagnose problems we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m39s)

[very likely to be conscious of those](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m42s)

[problems and not Implement them in code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m43s)

[so at the time it seemed weird](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m46s)

[the longer I've been doing this the more](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m49s)

[I think there there's I don't think it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m51s)

[a good principle to say we aren't going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m53s)

[to hire devs we are only going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m54s)

[promote from QA but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m56s)

[I don't think it's a bad idea either](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h47m59s)

[like the people who come out of people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m01s)

[who have had to spend time doing that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m04s)

[are very conscious of making sure that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m05s)

[their error messages are good so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m08s)

[every time I've tried to just get myself](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m11s)

[in the habit of every time I don't have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m13s)

[enough information from an air message](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m15s)

[and I have to go back to like a break](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m17s)

[point to look it up I try to think about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m19s)

[okay what should the error message have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m21s)

[been to give me enough information so in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m23s)

[this case this is enough information to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m25s)

[tell me okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m26s)

[it thinks that foreground light has a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m28s)

[color of zero zero zero zero zero](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m31s)

[that's not true](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m34s)

[and that means there is something else](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m36s)

[wrong when we do the set theme so we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m38s)

[want to track that down now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m42s)

[because in this case we are using the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m45s)

[bundled theme and the bundled theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m47s)

[uh does not have all the stuffs so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m51s)

[before we get too carried away I'm going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m54s)

[to just add](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h48m59s)

[when using built-in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m03s)

[uh light uh light xaml theme dictionary](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m04s)

[I'm gonna just do this to start because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m10s)

[I want to see this work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m12s)

[um and then we'll because I have a hunch](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m14s)

[I know what's falling apart here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m17s)

[but I want to see the most basic of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m19s)

[basic work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m22s)

[and then we'll we'll work backwards into](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m23s)

[the solution](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m26s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m28s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m34s)

[yeah so this is what I want to see work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m38s)

[is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m40s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m41s)

[we're going to come back over here to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m45s)

[our theme test this is what we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m46s)

[see work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m48s)

[right there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m50s)

[nothing fancy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m52s)

[at all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m55s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m57s)

[um I want to see this guy launch because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h49m58s)

[I have a I have a suspicion this one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m00s)

[will actually see a bunch of because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m02s)

[what I want to see is a bunch of colored](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m03s)

[boxes like that's that's what we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m05s)

[going for a bunch of boxes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m07s)

[with color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m09s)

[okay see that looks a lot better to me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m11s)

[not perfect but it looks a lot better](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m15s)

[okay you move to the side](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m19s)

[stay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m21s)

[continue](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m23s)

[okay you failed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m27s)

[uh uh yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m30s)

[okay so this this may be a legitimate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m33s)

[failure okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m35s)

[because I think I made a mistake and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m37s)

[added a bunch of brushes when I should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m39s)

[have done it otherwise so this this one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m41s)

[will actually clean this up okay so this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m42s)

[is this is perfect this is perfect we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m45s)

[gonna get this test working and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m48s)

[that will clean up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m49s)

[this is why we write tests this is why](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m51s)

[we write tests okay so the one in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m54s)

[question that it flagged was hey stop](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h50m56s)

[scrolling](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m00s)

[I'll go get the other darn it okay fine](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m01s)

[where's my other test window](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m04s)

[you come back](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m05s)

[sit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m07s)

[stay good boy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m09s)

[stop scrolling I just want to highlight](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m12s)

[okay so let's come back over to my Json](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m16s)

[file boom](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m18s)

[okay so this one here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m20s)

[oh interesting so it's Jenny](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m24s)

[it's getting this for the test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m30s)

[do I care](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m33s)

[I think I should be more intelligent](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m42s)

[with the test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m45s)

[rather than blindly doing this assertion](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m50s)

[oh because this guy takes in the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m54s)

[this guy gets the flattened set of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h51m58s)

[brushes doesn't he](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m00s)

[he does](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m06s)

[he does interesting okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m15s)

[yeah we should not pass this in and we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m34s)

[should do something a little more](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m37s)

[intelligent](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m41s)

[I think what we're gonna do is we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m42s)

[going to pass the brush tree and rather](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m43s)

[than the alternate brush tree so there's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m45s)

[there's two ways to approach this this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m47s)

[one here builds up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m49s)

[um so the brush tree is basically the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m52s)

[Json file as it sits the the alternate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m54s)

[one is where it inverts it and selects](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h52m57s)

[every alternate key gets a duplicate uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m00s)

[object instance with these values in it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m03s)

[that way the rest of the code can just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m05s)

[for each and doesn't need to think and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m07s)

[deal with like pulling those apart but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m09s)

[in this case I think we want to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m12s)

[smarter about it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m17s)

[so this guy here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m19s)

[I uh look at that I can't spell](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m26s)

[uh we'll deal with that problem real](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m32s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m35s)

[spelling](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m36s)

[so I almost want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m40s)

[I almost want this as not a local](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m45s)

[function and maybe what I should do is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m47s)

[let all the other ones do it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m54s)

[yeah I think I'm gonna move this out and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h53m59s)

[make this a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m01s)

[an alternate thing uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m05s)

[we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m13s)

[I'm wondering if I should actually](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m22s)

[overload this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m23s)

[and do an i enumerable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m27s)

[I think this is what I actually want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m33s)

[do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m34s)

[and then I think I move this guy back](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m38s)

[inside](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m40s)

[as a local function](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m42s)

[it's C sharp has local functions which](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m44s)

[is awesome](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m46s)

[and then we go back up here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m48s)

[because this guy was just doing a select](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m52s)

[mini on it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m53s)

[so then this guy just returns](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m55s)

[to rename this it's a bad name](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h54m58s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m00s)

[return](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m01s)

[brushes select Mini](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m02s)

[get alternate brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m06s)

[and then rather than building it up once](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m10s)

[it's a little wasteful but we will just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m13s)

[make each](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m15s)

[alternate one do it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m22s)

[brush tree](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m25s)

[and then we'll have each of these guys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m28s)

[be intelligent about what they're doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m30s)

[so where do you use it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m31s)

[uh right tree item brushes so we'll just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m34s)

[have you uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m38s)

[get all alternate brushes I'll just feed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m42s)

[that in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m45s)

[and that'll work great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m46s)

[uh what is your problem](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m49s)

[tree item why do you need the tree item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h55m57s)

[because you iterate on children](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m05s)

[why do you have children](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m13s)

[right that's right because it builds](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m17s)

[those up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m21s)

[got it that might be a little more](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m35s)

[problematic what was the return type of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m37s)

[that thing a second ago](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m39s)

[I'm wondering if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m41s)

[because I was called a build brush tree](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m47s)

[as the input](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m52s)

[okay let's back this out a little bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h56m56s)

[I think what we can do let's let's do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m08s)

[this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m10s)

[we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m14s)

[because this guy is taking a tree item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m20s)

[but I don't think he cares](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m22s)

[I don't think he matters if I convert](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m26s)

[this to an iron numerable I don't think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m28s)

[he cares so tree item is my own class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m30s)

[it's a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m33s)

[basic tree structure](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m35s)

[has a set of values set of children](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m38s)

[underneath it effectively each level of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m40s)

[this tree](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m43s)

[um you can think of it as if each of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m46s)

[these dots were a nesting level so all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m48s)

[the ones that are under material design](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m51s)

[are under One Direction then all the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m53s)

[brushes and then for example brush Dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m55s)

[card all the card ones end up together](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m57s)

[which is how it ends up doing the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h57m59s)

[grouping when it's generating the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m01s)

[c-sharp nested classes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m02s)

[which is what the that all represents](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m06s)

[but in this case](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m09s)

[this guy goes here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m13s)

[yeah so this guy is going to get this in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m26s)

[and this thing really just wants to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m34s)

[wait is that gonna be a problem though](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m43s)

[because the enumerator iterates over the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m45s)

[values and the children](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m47s)

[I don't think that's a problem](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m53s)

[I don't think that's a problem okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h58m59s)

[sorry I have to remember how my own code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m02s)

[works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m04s)

[it's probably an indication that it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m05s)

[not great code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m07s)

[so this is going to get a get all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m09s)

[alternate brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m11s)

[okay so this guy here we we want to be a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m12s)

[little more explicit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m16s)

[because we want to pull each brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m21s)

[oh but if we try to mutate this thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m30s)

[because what I really would like to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m32s)

[is I would like to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m34s)

[only do the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m37s)

[the hash set based on the top level item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m39s)

[and not the alternate ones](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m43s)

[that's kind of what I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m46s)

[so how would that what would that end up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m49s)

[looking like so the top level one would](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m51s)

[mean](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m53s)

[we would do this work for the top level](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m54s)

[one and then I would want for the given](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=00h59m57s)

[brush I would want to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m00s)

[almost the same thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m02s)

[I would want to do almost the same thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m07s)

[but not with its alternate keys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m10s)

[yeah because the keys aren't going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m18s)

[build brush tree](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m25s)

[so I'm trying to remember how this gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m28s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m30s)

[iterates through breaks up the container](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m32s)

[parts](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m35s)

[these are all based on the name](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m37s)

[yeah so these are base okay so this yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m40s)

[this is fine](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m42s)

[which is perfect](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m48s)

[but in my case none of that matters](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m54s)

[because all I really care about is to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h00m58s)

[iterate over the alternate keys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m00s)

[yeah so here what I want to do is I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m04s)

[to go for each](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m07s)

[uh VAR alternate key in Brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m09s)

[uh alternate keys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m16s)

[and numerable Dot empty so in this case](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m20s)

[we do have notable reference types](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m23s)

[turned on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m24s)

[and in general what I tell people is if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m26s)

[it's serializable it is probably](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m29s)

[nullable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m31s)

[it's really hard to find a use case](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m33s)

[where it's not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m39s)

[and then we don't care about that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m41s)

[we don't want that do I have double](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m45s)

[semicolons at the end of that I do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m46s)

[that's just done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m48s)

[feels like I should be able to redo used](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m50s)

[some of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m52s)

[yeah we won't worry about it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h01m58s)

[we won't worry about it for now uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m00s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m04s)

[lots of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m06s)

[should probably separate out reuse some](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m11s)

[strings that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m12s)

[okay so let's look at the tests that you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m19s)

[end up now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m22s)

[that should have done better so for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m23s)

[example this guy here adds in the scene](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m25s)

[colors but the alternate one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m28s)

[it doesn't bother to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m35s)

[uh oh I didn't swap out the brush that's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m44s)

[why it looks duplicated because it is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m46s)

[duplicated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m49s)

[um so this is alternate key so what we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m50s)

[want then to do is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m56s)

[uh brush uh gets brush with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h02m59s)

[uh let's see name gets alternate key](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m04s)

[uh because we basically want to do the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m10s)

[same thing that we're doing down here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m12s)

[alternate Keys gets no](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m14s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m19s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m22s)

[you want to do that and this should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m28s)

[probably not be a VAR](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m30s)

[so we can leverage the new with keyword](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m32s)

[because these are records](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m35s)

[I can easily clone them and just mutate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m37s)

[the properties I care about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m40s)

[oh that just works so let's try that one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m48s)

[more time](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m50s)

[see what the test looks like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m52s)

[there we go so it generated the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m54s)

[background the background one has the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m56s)

[hash set check it generated the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h03m58s)

[alternate key one no hash set check that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m01s)

[moves on to the next one okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m03s)

[given that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m08s)

[this probably still fails but it should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m13s)

[fail on a different one than it did last](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m15s)

[time](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m18s)

[which is what we're going for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m22s)

[okay expected true was false check box](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m25s)

[disabled yeah this is one where I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m29s)

[Kevin was Dumb and duplicated it so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m32s)

[let's go and look at checkbox disabled](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m36s)

[because I have a suspicion if I go if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m39s)

[go looking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m42s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m44s)

[boom check box disabled](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m46s)

[oh I wonder I don't Whoa man I can't do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m53s)

[this duplicate check can I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h04m57s)

[suck](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m00s)

[suck that's disappointing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m03s)

[sorry what I'm noticing is that the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m09s)

[duplication isn't across a single brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m12s)

[as you'll know in this case it's 700 700](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m17s)

[700 300.](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m19s)

[well that just bites okay so we should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m21s)

[probably abandon that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m24s)

[okay so let's look at what did we do in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m27s)

[the resource gen](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m29s)

[do we need any of these changes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m35s)

[discard](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m37s)

[um discard](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m41s)

[put all of this back](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m44s)

[now we'll leave that out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m47s)

[those are all fine](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m52s)

[that's a spelling fix that's the auto](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m54s)

[gen stuff which we want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m57s)

[this we don't want anymore](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h05m59s)

[this we don't want anymore](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m03s)

[we still want the null check on the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m06s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m08s)

[I don't want that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m10s)

[and I don't want this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m13s)

[and that can stay out here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m20s)

[rerun oh what did I mess up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m23s)

[oh hush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m26s)

[oh this I got a little too carried away](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m29s)

[with my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m33s)

[with my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m35s)

[deletions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m37s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m42s)

[so this may actually be in a working](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m46s)

[State I just I just don't know a good](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m48s)

[way to put the other one into a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m51s)

[into a failure state so I might just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m54s)

[have to abandon that for the moment and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h06m57s)

[accept that it's going to be passing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m01s)

[so both of these probably show green but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m04s)

[one of them probably doesn't have a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m07s)

[bunch of different colors to it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m08s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m19s)

[in reality I should probably have this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m21s)

[thing be asserting on the brush values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m23s)

[probably be a different test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m28s)

[should probably be a different test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m30s)

[but for now I want to I want to track](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m34s)

[down why the other one's not working](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m36s)

[properly and then we'll](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m38s)

[Circle back to the other problems okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m40s)

[so the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m42s)

[one that's not loading properly is the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m43s)

[bundled theme so let's go here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m46s)

[and I have a feeling I broke this fairly](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m49s)

[recently](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m52s)

[because it should come in here it should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m55s)

[hit apply theme apply theme should call](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m57s)

[set theme set theme should come in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h07m59s)

[these should get applied everything](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m01s)

[should work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m03s)

[that's the theory](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m05s)

[that is the theory and I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m08s)

[so let's uh we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m13s)

[I want to turn on the debugging so I can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m17s)

[debug the other half of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m20s)

[not that I want the bass class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m23s)

[uh debug the remote process true](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m27s)

[debug](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m31s)

[get me over to the other side](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m43s)

[okay so apply theme resources](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m47s)

[let's start with this do we have the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m51s)

[theme loaded that we expect](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m53s)

[because I kind of suspect the answer is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m55s)

[no](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h08m57s)

[it's the value of theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m06s)

[so that has a bunch of stuff in it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m12s)

[and they're all set there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m18s)

[let's go into here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m21s)

[right like theme background](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m24s)

[all of these seem](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m30s)

[the themed values are incorrect](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m37s)

[these are basically all white or all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m42s)

[black so something has gone](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m44s)

[horribly awry](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m46s)

[uh how did we get the theme object where](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m49s)

[did you come from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m52s)

[uh passed in from the collar Chase it up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m54s)

[the call stack](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m57s)

[theme create](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h09m59s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m02s)

[this is probably the issue](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m03s)

[I'm guessing get bass theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m07s)

[Dark theme light](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m11s)

[yeah see these are the these are the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m15s)

[ones that I kind of want to kill off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m17s)

[or at least Auto jet](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m19s)

[but I thought these were auto-chinning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m22s)

[oh these are autogening but these are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m28s)

[the right thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m30s)

[yeah okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m32s)

[um I think what we're gonna do is we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m45s)

[gonna change the way this works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m48s)

[I think we're gonna kill off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m51s)

[I base theme altogether](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m54s)

[because it doesn't serve because the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m57s)

[only purpose of the eye base theme okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h10m59s)

[yeah so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m01s)

[we're just gonna act some stuff real](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m03s)

[quick so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m05s)

[this guy here what this really needs to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m07s)

[be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m10s)

[is not this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m11s)

[I want the following method to work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m13s)

[we're gonna start here because I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m16s)

[this to really just be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m18s)

[bass theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m24s)

[and most of these these things are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m40s)

[probably about dead now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m43s)

[yeah because this this code is going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m47s)

[end up dying Okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m49s)

[this is the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h11m55s)

[this is the code that I want to work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m01s)

[we're just gonna keep going set bass](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m04s)

[theme I want an overload of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m06s)

[that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m17s)

[that just works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m19s)

[uh okay we're gonna file scope that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m22s)

[namespace while we're in here because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m25s)

[that's what I do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m27s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m31s)

[so we're gonna do something like uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m36s)

[switch on the enum](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m40s)

[a co-pilot write all the code for me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m42s)

[make me write code copilot how dare you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m51s)

[uh yeah that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m54s)

[can you put the break statement for me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m56s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h12m58s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m00s)

[and the default and we're going to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m01s)

[default thanks](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m03s)

[uh no default we're just gonna do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m05s)

[nothing because if it says inherit we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m07s)

[just don't want to change it okay so if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m09s)

[we come into here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m11s)

[what I think I want to do is on this guy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m14s)

[this needs to become a partial](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m19s)

[and then we're just going to abuse](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m22s)

[partial methods again I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m28s)

[because I think what I want is a public](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m31s)

[static void set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m33s)

[Dart theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m36s)

[this theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m38s)

[turn that off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m41s)

[and I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m44s)

[I want that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m49s)

[uh let's see partial method must have an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m52s)

[implementation it will hush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h13m56s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m01s)

[technically I've been doing these things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m04s)

[in the other order](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m06s)

[not that it's a big deal but uh set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m08s)

[light theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m11s)

[it's that dark theme theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m15s)

[okay so that's what I want to work I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m18s)

[want all this code to work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m20s)

[and then my test will be in a happier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m22s)

[place](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m24s)

[then we can obsolete this method and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m25s)

[kill it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m27s)

[um but let's so in order for this to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m30s)

[work we need to generate up this theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m33s)

[mixins class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m35s)

[let's look at where it lives first of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m36s)

[all show me your spot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m38s)

[okay so you're right alongside theme so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m41s)

[we come back](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m43s)

[out of here and go here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m45s)

[you collapse uh generate theme class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m49s)

[copy paste generate theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m51s)

[mixins](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m55s)

[I think we started standard did we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m57s)

[standardize on mixins](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h14m59s)

[yeah I think we're going to be renaming](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m07s)

[this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m12s)

[uh theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m19s)

[while we're in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m22s)

[I think we're gonna just standardize on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m27s)

[extensions and call it a day](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m29s)

[uh hello didn't I just rename you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m32s)

[okay we'll do it here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m38s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m43s)

[don't think do what I told you okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m46s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m53s)

[so I want a partial get the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h15m55s)

[extensions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m02s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m06s)

[trying to think of what's the pro what's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m12s)

[the so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m15s)

[I want to think about what's the code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m17s)

[that I actually want to want to set here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m18s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m21s)

[what I really want to do is I want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m23s)

[iterate through theme like background](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m25s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m30s)

[what's the lowest cost way to create a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m33s)

[color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m36s)

[what is the lowest cost I assume it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m38s)

[Constructors probably the lowest cost](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m41s)

[because I don't really because I could](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m47s)

[go from RGB](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m48s)

[but isn't is this just a convenience](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m50s)

[thing over the color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m52s)

[yeah I'm wondering is the Constructor](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h16m58s)

[you know from argb might be the cleanest](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m07s)

[approach](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m12s)

[so we'll do we'll generate a bunch of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m13s)

[calls like this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m16s)

[yeah so 0x0 so we'll just do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m21s)

[we'll do something like well gen so we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m25s)

[want to iterate over all of the brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m27s)

[and we want to do this maneuver](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m28s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m31s)

[okay so we want to generate uh Set Dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m33s)

[set light theme brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m36s)

[uh and we want it to be very similar to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m41s)

[this so we're gonna just copy that one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m43s)

[and generate theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m46s)

[extensions class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m50s)

[okay and this is going to be theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m53s)

[extensions.g.cs](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h17m58s)

[at some point I'm gonna do some Ms build](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m01s)

[work so these get nested and kind of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m04s)

[hidden away from people since I don't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m05s)

[want them touching them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m06s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m08s)

[so step one we need to make sure our](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m10s)

[namespace is correct which it should be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m13s)

[and then we're gonna do this guy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m15s)

[and we're gonna go here and I generally](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m19s)

[like to let the other half of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m21s)

[partial Drive](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m24s)

[the access modifier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m26s)

[the generation shouldn't care it's just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m28s)

[its job is to generate one thing and one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m31s)

[thing only](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m33s)

[um I don't think I want this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m35s)

[uh let's see what is this doing right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m43s)

[tree item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m45s)

[yeah so I do want to iterate through](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m50s)

[this thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m53s)

[I don't know if I actually care though I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m57s)

[can kind of just rip straight can't I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h18m59s)

[I think what I can do is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m06s)

[I don't need to go through the children](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m13s)

[I think I can just go straight](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m20s)

[iteration over all of it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m25s)

[because I think what we can do is rather](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m31s)

[than doing this this type of stuff here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m33s)

[we can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m37s)

[we'll we'll do a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m39s)

[a write method uh what were we calling](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m41s)

[it they were called set something](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m44s)

[uh write set theme method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m47s)

[set theme method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m52s)

[we'll do that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m54s)

[because I'm I basically want to do the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m56s)

[same thing for light and dark and go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h19m58s)

[crazy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m02s)

[so here what we want to do we don't need](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m06s)

[this iteration garbage](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m12s)

[uh very bad practice I would say](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m17s)

[uh what's up Andrew](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m20s)

[uh sorry my my chat's a little delayed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m21s)

[you want to give a little context](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m26s)

[okay so I don't want to deal I don't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m31s)

[think I want any of this garbage](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m33s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m36s)

[so let's let's write the method that I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m37s)

[actually want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m39s)

[I want to pass in all of the brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m41s)

[I want the rider](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m44s)

[the indent level is probably a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m47s)

[meaningless thing for the moment but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m49s)

[we're gonna leave it until I have a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m52s)

[reason to change it so in this case](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m54s)

[we're already inside the class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h20m57s)

[um technically our indent level starts](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m01s)

[at one in this case because we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m03s)

[indent four spaces](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m05s)

[and then I want to implement this method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m07s)

[here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m11s)

[functionally what we want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m13s)

[stop it stop it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m15s)

[need more Mountain Dew to think straight](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m21s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m23s)

[so the teacher](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m25s)

[let's see so the first thing is I guess](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m32s)

[we just start with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m37s)

[uh writer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m39s)

[right line and then we're gonna go with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m42s)

[the newer stuff because reasons](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m44s)

[and then we're gonna do two levels of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m48s)

[interpolation because we've we're gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m52s)

[have curly braces here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m54s)

[so step one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m56s)

[we want this guy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h21m59s)

[is the first bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m03s)

[and we want to prefix it with an indent](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m05s)

[very close to just going and grabbing an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m09s)

[an indented Stream Rider](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m12s)

[very very close](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m16s)

[uh see and then that becomes that with a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m19s)

[curly brace](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m22s)

[and then just so that we don't forget](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m24s)

[about it somewhere at the end of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m26s)

[we're going to end up doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m28s)

[the opposite curly brace because we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m30s)

[going to need that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m33s)

[that's way too much stuff to write a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m35s)

[single curly brace but I'm not sure if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m36s)

[need more stuff yet so we're gonna wait](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m38s)

[and then we want to rip through all of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m42s)

[the brushes and generate out something](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m44s)

[that looks kind of like this so let's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m46s)

[just go for each](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m52s)

[uh brush and tree item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h22m54s)

[rush I want to see my type](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m01s)

[and then let's go with uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m03s)

[face](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m08s)

[and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m10s)

[open that up and then we want to do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m20s)

[ugly mess here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m24s)

[so theme will be fine this is going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m26s)

[end up needing to be the name of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m29s)

[brushes property path](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m32s)

[so that is going to be property name I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m35s)

[think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m39s)

[yeah so we want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m40s)

[that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m43s)

[oh I jumped the wrong place](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m47s)

[brush property name](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m53s)

[color should be fine though we're going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m56s)

[to be lacking a using statement](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h23m58s)

[we need to make sure we put that into](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m01s)

[the partial up above](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m03s)

[oh we've already got it great okay great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m06s)

[um and then we need to pull out the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m10s)

[brushes color the problem being](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m12s)

[this guy may not know his color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m18s)

[that is an interesting problem he may](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m25s)

[not actually know his color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m28s)

[because at the end of the day these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m34s)

[colors are defy like even though these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m37s)

[things are set up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m39s)

[they may be an RGB value they may not be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m43s)

[they may be a resource key and I need](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m47s)

[these things to stay in sync](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m49s)

[so in code if I want to pull these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m52s)

[things out what's the easiest way to get](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m55s)

[at them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m57s)

[because ultimately these things are kind](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h24m58s)

[of fixed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m01s)

[they're kind of fixed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m06s)

[right so where's the file that has them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m08s)

[there's a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m10s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m12s)

[this guy has all the magical things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m16s)

[I'm wondering if I need to move some of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m35s)

[this so that I have access to these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m38s)

[values elsewhere](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m40s)

[because the fact that this isn't easily](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m48s)

[accessible is kind of a problem](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m50s)

[or is it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h25m55s)

[it's kind of a problem because at the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m00s)

[end of the day I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m03s)

[for people who don't want to go the Zam](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m06s)

[approach and need to be able to pull the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m08s)

[color values directly](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m10s)

[I'm wondering if it makes sense to gen](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m19s)

[these because right now this is just a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m22s)

[file I put together I could also](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m24s)

[I'm kind of wondering about just making](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m28s)

[a class here for it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m31s)

[I'm kind of wondering about just doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m42s)

[this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m44s)

[that might be easiest](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m52s)

[that might be easiest okay we're gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m56s)

[do coding by regex](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h26m59s)

[Cody by regex is what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m05s)

[uh what I did so copy there we are uh uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m08s)

[let me grab](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m12s)

[just move this real quick to make sure](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m15s)

[because I don't know what I'm on real](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m17s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m18s)

[there okay so uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m20s)

[you big okay so step one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m24s)

[turn regex matching on Match white space](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m29s)

[any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m33s)

[from the beginning of the string replace](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m35s)

[with empty okay so that flattens up all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m37s)

[of those](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m39s)

[we want to now match uh X colon key](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m40s)

[equals quote uh pren](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m45s)

[um match any character that is not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m50s)

[quote](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m54s)

[uh some number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h27m57s)

[close paren quote](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m00s)

[that's our key](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m04s)

[we ultimately want this to turn into uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m07s)

[public](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m10s)

[color and I think all of these are valid](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m12s)

[names so we'll just do dollar sign one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m20s)

[uh public](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m23s)

[static read-only color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m24s)

[uh gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m28s)

[can we just do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m33s)

[I just want to check this real quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m36s)

[because I think what I want it to become](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m38s)

[is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m45s)

[who gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m46s)

[import the type for me please thank you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m49s)

[new](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h28m53s)

[color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m00s)

[from uh argb](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m02s)

[and then I just want zero X](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m06s)

[blah blah blah blah blah so that's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m10s)

[that's that's what we're aiming to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m11s)

[implement right there okay so we're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m13s)

[gonna do that so color gets one gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m15s)

[color from argb](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m18s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m21s)

[okay so then we need to match over to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m23s)

[here so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m26s)

[uh anything pick it all up until you hit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m28s)

[color equals quote](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m32s)

[uh pound and then I want to match](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m35s)

[uh the first character exactly two](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m40s)

[repetitions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m43s)

[uh and we're gonna just object group](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m45s)

[this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m47s)

[so we don't care too much and we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m49s)

[repeat this four times](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m51s)

[uh one two three four](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m54s)

[and then we'll match any character any](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h29m58s)

[number of reputations all the way to the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m01s)

[end of the line just so we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m03s)

[clean that mess up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m05s)

[and then start a line](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m08s)

[that okay so each of those lines are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m11s)

[going to match we're going to come into](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m14s)

[here this is going to become 0 x](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m15s)

[uh dollar side two comma zero X right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m18s)

[because it's a r g b right a r g b good](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m23s)

[so we're doing this in the right order](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m27s)

[uh zero X dollar sign three zero X](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m28s)

[dollar sign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m34s)

[four and zero X dollar sign five close](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m35s)

[print semicolon replace all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m41s)

[oh I got an extra closing parenth](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m45s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m49s)

[uh so undo](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m50s)

[and we go here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m53s)

[semicolon](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m54s)

[try again](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m56s)

[that's pretty good copy paste](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h30m59s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m07s)

[X coating](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m11s)

[I'll take it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m17s)

[actually I can probably answer it the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m27s)

[resource dictionary functionally is so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m29s)

[this Pro there's no reason for the this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m31s)

[not to be it's under an internal](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m34s)

[namespace so that should hopefully give](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m36s)

[people some pause before they do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m38s)

[anything crazy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m40s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m43s)

[so then that means that makes this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m45s)

[generation a little bit easier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m49s)

[we're going to need a little bit of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m52s)

[logic here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m53s)

[because it either is going to match](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h31m58s)

[it's either going to match one of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m03s)

[other one it's either gonna match one of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m05s)

[these names here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m07s)

[uh let's put the using statement in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m12s)

[boom that goes there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m16s)

[uh so we will do if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m18s)

[brush dot uh what is it value](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m22s)

[theme values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m31s)

[uh you put the theme in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m39s)

[bring value gets like that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m43s)

[uh so if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m47s)

[value dot starts with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m49s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m57s)

[uh string comparison](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h32m58s)

[ordinal don't do anything fancy to me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m01s)

[please](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m05s)

[uh so if it starts with a pound we can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m07s)

[do it we can do the this maneuver](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m10s)

[uh else we're gonna do the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m15s)

[put you up here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m21s)

[else we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m26s)

[so this then changes to become](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m28s)

[base theme colors](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m37s)

[uh Dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m38s)

[value](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m40s)

[boom so that goes like that that goes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m43s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m45s)

[let's indent these a little bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m47s)

[maybe one more](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m50s)

[okay so that handles that half of it the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m55s)

[other one up here if it starts with this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h33m58s)

[uh let's just do uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m02s)

[uh color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m06s)

[they're a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m09s)

[they're color parser](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m17s)

[am I just crazy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m20s)

[seriously](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m25s)

[oh do I have to go through the type](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m28s)

[converter if I want to come from string](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m29s)

[that is a little annoying](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m36s)

[I have to parse the values or I have to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m39s)

[go from the type converter](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m45s)

[oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m50s)

[uh uh type converter](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m52s)

[uh no type descriptor](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h34m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m01s)

[uh get converter](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m03s)

[right what is the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m06s)

[type of color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m20s)

[convert from string value](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m22s)

[there I'm too lazy to think to think too](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m28s)

[hard on this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m30s)

[this is going to become](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m33s)

[uh see oh and this needs to be a hard](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m42s)

[cast because it returns](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m45s)

[object](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m48s)

[unboxing and possibly null value yep](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m50s)

[I get it no uh let's see a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h35m55s)

[and this I believe is X2 is the format](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m01s)

[string we want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m04s)

[doing this for memory so we'll see how](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m08s)

[how it works let's see a r](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m10s)

[it's getting really long and my Fat](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m13s)

[Head's about to get in the way](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m15s)

[RG](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m17s)

[B](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m21s)

[okay something like that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m24s)

[we get rid of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m28s)

[who does some sort of generation like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m32s)

[that let's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m34s)

[let's run it and see how close we are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m36s)

[because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m37s)

[first one never works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m45s)

[Unknown theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m51s)

[oh because I just passed an empty okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m53s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m55s)

[if you pass empty string that's not a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h36m57s)

[it's not a theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m00s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m01s)

[uh string theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m05s)

[so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m14s)

[you know light first I guess](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m17s)

[go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m23s)

[do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m26s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m27s)

[two birds one stone theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m29s)

[two lowered variants](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m33s)

[should work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m37s)

[try again](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m40s)

[rinse repeat](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m42s)

[okay well it did something](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m49s)

[uh theme extensions take me to your spot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m53s)

[there's the generated class so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h37m55s)

[okay so not bad it got](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m00s)

[most of what we wanted](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m04s)

[it did not appropriately generate out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m07s)

[the entire](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m09s)

[uh property pattern path that is okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m11s)

[that is okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m18s)

[I think if we look at](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m19s)

[one of these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m22s)

[one of these other ones I already did](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m25s)

[that work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m27s)

[I think it was the resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m28s)

[one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m32s)

[uh apply theme colors I think use it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m33s)

[does it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m37s)

[uh let's see here get resource keys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m39s)

[uh so let's just look at the generated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m48s)

[code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m50s)

[yeah so I want to look at the load theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m55s)

[colors method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h38m57s)

[load theme colors](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m00s)

[uh property prefix](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m03s)

[ah so I did this maneuver](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m07s)

[so we want to do something where we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m11s)

[write it out and have a prefix](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m14s)

[that starts like that and then gets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m19s)

[tacked onto got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m21s)

[got it got it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m24s)

[understood I understood I remember what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m25s)

[I did now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m28s)

[uh okay that's the one above it not the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m29s)

[one below it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m33s)

[is that extra space](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m39s)

[so down here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m41s)

[we want to have nope not what I told you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m44s)

[to do do that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m47s)

[okay property prefix goes there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m49s)

[and these ones are both going to start](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m53s)

[with uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m55s)

[uh theme Dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h39m56s)

[that way I can slowly add on to it as we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m01s)

[go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m04s)

[so those ones go there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m06s)

[um this then becomes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m09s)

[really braces](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m14s)

[uh property prefix](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m16s)

[and then what did we do here so is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m20s)

[property prefix property name great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m22s)

[and then we iterate over children and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m24s)

[recursively call](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m27s)

[and do that okay so we come up here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m30s)

[um we can probably just drop this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m34s)

[garbage](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m38s)

[and drop all pretenses of indentation](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m40s)

[because we aren't going to use it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m43s)

[um okay so this is going to be recursive](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m49s)

[in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m52s)

[so this needs to iterate not over](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m54s)

[brushes though this needs to iterate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m56s)

[over values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h40m58s)

[yeah tree item dot values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m02s)

[so I actually want to do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m06s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m10s)

[try them Dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m12s)

[values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m14s)

[and then rather than](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m16s)

[doing something funky we want to do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m19s)

[after we've done all the values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m24s)

[we want to iterate over the children and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m26s)

[the children want to call into here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m29s)

[uh uh this is going to be problematic](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m35s)

[because I can't I only want the inner](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m38s)

[stuff being recursive not everything](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m41s)

[and this for each needs to be below the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m45s)

[values call so this little bit I want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m48s)

[bring into a function](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m54s)

[uh let's bring you down here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h41m59s)

[uh right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m02s)

[three item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m07s)

[so I want to do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m11s)

[this maneuver into here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m14s)

[I want right oh my word thank you for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m18s)

[helping but that's not helpful](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m22s)

[uh um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m27s)

[just duplicate this string I'm not real](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m35s)

[concerned about it oh string allocation](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m37s)

[even in a recursive message like this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m40s)

[it's not going to be huge](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m42s)

[this here string is causing me grief](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m54s)

[I'm just trying to keep track where I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m56s)

[at so I will want that I don't want that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h42m57s)

[I do want child.name](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m00s)

[you want to append that and we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m06s)

[pass](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m09s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m10s)

[um but I think we're gonna drop the two](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m17s)

[lower here and have the color do that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m19s)

[because we're going to go up here right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m25s)

[tree item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m27s)

[tree item](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m30s)

[writer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m32s)

[beam to lower invariant](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m34s)

[and we can actually take this out of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m43s)

[here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m45s)

[so we don't need it here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m47s)

[that doesn't need to exist clean that up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m51s)

[a little bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m54s)

[only pass what you need](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m55s)

[okay so that goes there that goes there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h43m59s)

[this one this is doing the theme dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m01s)

[because it's declaring it there that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m03s)

[sets that up this comes in this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m05s)

[recursive this alliterate over the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m07s)

[children get rid of all the dead white](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m09s)

[space will generate and it'll work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m11s)

[flawlessly and everyone will be happy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m13s)

[and that will make me very excited](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m14s)

[well we got closer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m23s)

[oh yeah well this isn't quite right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m27s)

[flat click](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m34s)

[I do wrong here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m37s)

[okay so let's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m48s)

[first](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m53s)

[so this should have been buttons dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m54s)

[flat click](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h44m56s)

[why did I only get some of these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m00s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m03s)

[wait what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m06s)

[very awkward](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m10s)

[okay I think we're gonna rerun here in a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m13s)

[minute after we fix this first bug](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m16s)

[um because this is child name](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m19s)

[pluralize](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m23s)

[because that really should be the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m25s)

[generation there okay so that should go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m29s)

[there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m32s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m40s)

[that surprises me that that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m43s)

[must have missed something here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m46s)

[uh oh because I've got](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m48s)

[okay so there's a couple things going on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m51s)

[here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m53s)

[it's gonna be one of the problems when](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m56s)

[when you fix the problem you can see and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h45m59s)

[then deal with the one you can't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m00s)

[always fix the problem you can see first](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m04s)

[um okay so this thing is not iterating](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m08s)

[the way I expect](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m11s)

[why](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m14s)

[why you no do what I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m16s)

[why you no do what I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m19s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m22s)

[extensions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m25s)

[I mean let's just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m28s)

[just debug it I guess and jump in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m30s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m38s)

[yeah so uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m41s)

[launcher debugging and let's step and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m44s)

[see what's going on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m47s)

[okay so we come in here that much is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m49s)

[fine that much is fine](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m51s)

[our tree item has four values 14](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m53s)

[children](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m56s)

[that's fine we'll step in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h46m58s)

[we iterate over the four values great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m00s)

[great great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m02s)

[I'm a little surprised wait](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m15s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m20s)

[should not be seeing this writer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m22s)

[writing this out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m27s)

[I guess I don't have auto flush turned](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m32s)

[on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m34s)

[but shouldn't expect to see it in the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m35s)

[fly okay that's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m37s)

[so we got through there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m42s)

[it's very so one two three four](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m46s)

[and then it this is where then we get](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m50s)

[Lost In The Weeds](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m53s)

[all right okay so there it's done now it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m56s)

[should go into its first child okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h47m58s)

[this is the child of card](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m02s)

[so the property fees should be theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m04s)

[cards uh Dot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m07s)

[all right so we go in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m10s)

[property prefix is themes Dot cards](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m13s)

[finds the brush](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m16s)

[the brush value is white 100](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m18s)

[it comes in here and I only put the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m21s)

[property prefix implemented in one place](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m24s)

[and that's the problem](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m26s)

[I am a [ __ ]](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m28s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m30s)

[see little debugging is all it takes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m34s)

[and then a sip of Mountain Dew to fix](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m37s)

[the uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m40s)

[the stupid](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m42s)

[okay now we got something a little](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m46s)

[prettier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m48s)

[okay so aside from wanting a little bit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m52s)

[of white space there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m55s)

[pretty close](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m57s)

[so we're gonna do uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h48m59s)

[right or right line right in the middle](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m02s)

[there and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m05s)

[just to make it a little cleaner to look](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m07s)

[at even when it even though this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m08s)

[generated I want it to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m10s)

[legible](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m14s)

[okay so all of this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m16s)

[so that the base theme stuff works as](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m21s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m24s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m25s)

[so we were we were dealing with a test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m26s)

[in yield days uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m28s)

[uh bundled theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m34s)

[right because this guy was going to come](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m37s)

[in here and this guy was not going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m38s)

[call get base theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m40s)

[in fact we are going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m42s)

[well so when this works we're going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m46s)

[just go through and ax all that here in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m48s)

[a minute but this guy now becomes much](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m49s)

[simpler you just passed the E Newman](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m51s)

[and I think that works a lot better](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m57s)

[these two things die we don't need any](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h49m59s)

[of the the fancy references and all of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m02s)

[that stuff](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m04s)

[this is going to make it's gonna be a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m05s)

[mess but whatever](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m08s)

[I think it's much cleaner to just work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m11s)

[with that directly](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m13s)

[rather than having to do look up stuff](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m15s)

[um let's go back to the test then really](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m19s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m24s)

[and I want to see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m25s)

[when using this guy I want to see you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m28s)

[show up and show me a nice colored](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m32s)

[palette](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m34s)

[like what your friend did](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m36s)

[uh debugger false](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m39s)

[uh test Explorer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m43s)

[and then debug test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m47s)

[these should fire up but we should see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m51s)

[the colored boxes again that's the goal](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m52s)

[that's the goal](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h50m54s)

[some point I might get fancy make the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m02s)

[boxes bigger or something but yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m04s)

[uh that looks worse not better](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m11s)

[let's just confirm what we're looking at](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m17s)

[so our wrap panel](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m19s)

[there's a whole bunch of things and if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m22s)

[we look at the background color of all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m24s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m25s)

[I did not set the theme appropriately](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m30s)

[lovely okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m32s)

[show](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m35s)

[let's come back here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m36s)

[and I would like to look at this method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m39s)

[and I would like to promote you and I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m43s)

[would like to turn debugging back on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m45s)

[for the remote host](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m48s)

[and then let's go and see why that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m51s)

[didn't do what I expected](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m53s)

[because we should have landed on that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h51m59s)

[new overload](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m00s)

[okay so base theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m06s)

[oh base theme is set to inherit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m09s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m15s)

[what was base theme doing if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m18s)

[how was it figuring out the base theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m25s)

[uh let's see oh this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m32s)

[get bass theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m36s)

[ha ha](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m39s)

[this is what we need](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m42s)

[got it we need to do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m52s)

[so the default case uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h52m56s)

[uh we just do an or](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m03s)

[uh uh we'll just do a case](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m07s)

[inherit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m10s)

[when](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m12s)

[no I think we're gonna go down here and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m22s)

[just do something like if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m24s)

[boy I really wish I could recurse this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m27s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m29s)

[oh probably should do a little debugging](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h53m45s)

[we'll just we'll just double switch it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m08s)

[it's kind of ugly but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m10s)

[thank you co-pilot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m12s)

[show off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m16s)

[yeah I don't like it that much but ugh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m18s)

[I don't like it that much but it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m23s)

[at the moment make it work make it right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m26s)

[make it fast](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m28s)

[make it work make it right make it fast](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m30s)

[make it work make it right make it fast](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m32s)

[just gotta remember that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m35s)

[dude come on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m49s)

[this time colored boxes all I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m51s)

[colored boxes Hallelujah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m55s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h54m59s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m04s)

[so now that that's working let's go ax](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m06s)

[the rest of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m08s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m11s)

[well hold on let's do a commit first](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m15s)

[uh getting the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m17s)

[custom theme uh getting the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m20s)

[bundled theme resource](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m24s)

[dictionary working okay so I should](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m28s)

[should probably start killing some of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m31s)

[the old apis so that I stop](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m34s)

[so I'm forced to then go and fix it so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m36s)

[bundled theme custom color theme is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m39s)

[going to be basically the same boat](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m42s)

[where it's going to do the same thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m45s)

[we're gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m47s)

[just get rid of that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m49s)

[yeah because the only difference is this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m54s)

[one doesn't look up on the enum this one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m55s)

[just passes the color straight through](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h55m57s)

[great great](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m02s)

[let's ax base theme I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m03s)

[how many references do you have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m08s)

[enough to be obnoxious](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m18s)

[well we'll start by deleting you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m19s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m24s)

[uh go to delete you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m30s)

[which makes me feel like I am on the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m36s)

[right path for a better designed in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m38s)

[general if I can delete code and add](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m41s)

[functionality](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m43s)

[you know you're doing something right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m49s)

[so that should cause just a handful of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m51s)

[compile errors](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m54s)

[then we're gonna go chase those down so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h56m59s)

[that'll probably clean up a bunch of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m02s)

[this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m04s)

[okay so you and you are gonna die](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m06s)

[we no longer need you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m09s)

[I no longer need you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m12s)

[um I probably should be killing off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m17s)

[most of these things as well](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m20s)

[yeah so your usages are all going to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m27s)

[drop real quick](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m30s)

[um once we get rid of the apis that use](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m34s)

[it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m37s)

[that gets rid of that that gets rid of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m39s)

[that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m41s)

[okay that makes life](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m44s)

[a lot easier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m47s)

[a lot easier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m49s)

[did I ever turn on the accelerated build](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h57m55s)

[oh I should turn on the ETC accelerated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m01s)

[build](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m03s)

[oh I should turn that off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m05s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m07s)

[now let's look at what we've got set Bay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m09s)

[State value so this thing then just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m11s)

[becomes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m15s)

[bass theme dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m16s)

[and bass theme light boom done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m20s)

[they seem dark based in light done](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m28s)

[uh uh next ones probably identical boom](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m32s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m36s)

[uh uh yep](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m40s)

[yep](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m48s)

[thank you and telecode you are awesome](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m54s)

[okay did we get most of them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h58m59s)

[it's a good chunk of them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m03s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m09s)

[is dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m13s)

[hold on what are we doing here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m16s)

[That Base theme is dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m19s)

[face themed dark otherwise](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m23s)

[bass theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m26s)

[light](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m28s)

[that seems that seems like a better API](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m32s)

[uh that's cleaned up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m36s)

[uh okay verify I like colors and theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m40s)

[this entire test gets to die I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m47s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m54s)

[those are all dead](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=01h59m59s)

[this is dead this is this entire thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m01s)

[is worthless now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m04s)

[excellent oh I love deleting code](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m08s)

[oh it's like spring cleaning when you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m12s)

[have a huge mess and you finally get it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m14s)

[cleaned up and you feel so much better](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m16s)

[that's what the leading code feels like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m18s)

[love it love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m21s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m24s)

[so this is looking what is this trying](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m28s)

[to do here and all values are set theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m31s)

[is set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m34s)

[uh this is trying to verify that the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m37s)

[theme comes out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m40s)

[uh this is looking to make sure that the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m45s)

[light theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m48s)

[value is set from the body](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m56s)

[come back to that in a moment](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h00m58s)

[as I haven't necessarily said a clean](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m00s)

[way of doing that yet](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m02s)

[uh let's see here this is once again](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m07s)

[another is dark ternary](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m10s)

[uh let's see base theme dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m13s)

[I'll space the light](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m18s)

[cleaned up cleaned up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m27s)

[okay so it's just that one test where](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m30s)

[I'm not entirely clear](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m32s)

[that I have a replacement API for it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m34s)

[so basically the same test only in two](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m41s)

[different places verifying that the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m44s)

[research dictionaries apply their themes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m47s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m49s)

[so this thing when it calls get theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m51s)

[it is expected to pull it out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h01m55s)

[and really what we want to check is just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m01s)

[to verify that the the body brush was](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m03s)

[set is the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m07s)

[seven total in real really these things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m09s)

[should be using a generated test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m12s)

[now that I can generate the list of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m14s)

[these brushes to make sure they're all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m16s)

[set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m17s)

[honestly because these are so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m34s)

[somebody wanted to get the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m41s)

[because the body is like the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m46s)

[foreground text](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m48s)

[so if somebody wanted to pull that off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m51s)

[of the light theme what would be the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m53s)

[appropriate API to do that with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m55s)

[so we've just kind of deleted](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h02m59s)

[the easy way of getting access to that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m02s)

[what is the best way of doing that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m09s)

[because we have a way of setting the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m14s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m16s)

[I mean I I so I think the easiest way is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m36s)

[set light theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m37s)

[all right so our](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m41s)

[light theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m44s)

[I'm just worried that this is a little](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m57s)

[bit recursive in the test of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h03m59s)

[but this is the generated method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m03s)

[so I think the idea being that it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m06s)

[it's not default](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m13s)

[and it's equal I think it's the the way](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m16s)

[to do this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m19s)

[light theme and it's not going to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m20s)

[body it's going to be like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m23s)

[foreground](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m25s)

[uh where did this come from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m29s)

[I do wonder if I should make these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m39s)

[things equatable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m40s)

[would anybody want to equate themes by](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m43s)

[value](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m46s)

[I mean I kind of do in a test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m47s)

[I don't know if that's a valuable](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m50s)

[functionality for people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m51s)

[because if I do that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m54s)

[oh I really can't make him records dang](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m56s)

[it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m58s)

[uh so the the drawback with records](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h04m59s)

[specifically](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m04s)

[well if I don't use positional records I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m05s)

[think I can get away with it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m07s)

[because the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m11s)

[um init keyword](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m13s)

[you have to assume that people are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m15s)

[operating under a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m17s)

[a version that supports it and I still](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m20s)

[support yield and versions of C sharp](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m31s)

[so let's do](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m32s)

[let's do that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m46s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m48s)

[hey papa how you doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m50s)

[okay I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h05m57s)

[I'm not sure I love it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m02s)

[but I think it'll work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m07s)

[doing well I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m09s)

[I'm poking away at the uh material](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m12s)

[design theming stuff for the 5.0 release](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m14s)

[and deleting code as I go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m17s)

[it's gonna be it's going to be a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m21s)

[breaking change for a lot of people but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m23s)

[hopefully not that big of a break I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m25s)

[think most people are just using the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m28s)

[public apis or the the big obvious apis](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m30s)

[and not doing a lot of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m33s)

[lower stuff](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m35s)

[because I I had a bunch of convenience](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m39s)

[methods that that I suspect most people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m41s)

[are probably using](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m43s)

[and I think that's that's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m46s)

[probably the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m48s)

[I mean it's a major version rev of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m51s)

[library so people should expect breaking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m53s)

[changes but I always try to I try to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m55s)

[mitigate the pain as much as I can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h06m57s)

[because nobody likes to uh try to Revel](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m01s)

[library and then realize they've got 2](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m03s)

[000 compilers and have to spend](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m05s)

[days of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m07s)

[days of cleanup that just that just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m09s)

[kills adoption](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m12s)

[but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m15s)

[we just deleted a bunch of code so that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m17s)

[makes me feel better so let's see uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m19s)

[removed I base theme](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m22s)

[interface dead](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m25s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m28s)

[much more convenient](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m30s)

[okay so let's go back and make sure that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m34s)

[and make sure that the other test works](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m37s)

[and then I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m39s)

[I think that's that's getting us in a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m41s)

[lot better shape](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m44s)

[so I've got a little CLI app that is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m46s)

[it's it's not using Source generators](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m49s)

[only because some of the stuff that I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m52s)

[want to generate is xaml files and you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m55s)

[can't use a c-sharp source generator to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h07m57s)

[generate a xaml file](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m00s)

[because the xaml compile happens before](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m02s)

[the c-sharp compile which is when the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m04s)

[c-sharp source generators run](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m06s)

[so to get your xaml file included you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m08s)

[have to generate it before that point](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m11s)

[so that's it's mildly obnoxious](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m18s)

[and in theory most of these files aren't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m20s)

[going to to change that much I've just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m22s)

[got basically I've been defining out my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m25s)

[theme brushes like this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m28s)

[so that they're simple and easy to work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m30s)

[with and then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m31s)

[in theory only when this thing changes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m34s)

[will those other files going to be uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m36s)

[change](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m39s)

[don't worry about Papa I uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m43s)

[I I usually warn people that I can talk](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m47s)

[for hours about coding even if I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m49s)

[talking to myself](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m51s)

[my poor colleagues have to deal with me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m53s)

[uh just chatting away](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m55s)

[yeah Justin Bieber I looked at T4 and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h08m58s)

[I've used it in the past](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m01s)

[this just felt a little bit easier to me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m03s)

[so it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m08s)

[yeah like like T4 is fine but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m09s)

[in in my case sometimes it's just easier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m14s)

[to read in a Json file](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m17s)

[and do the manipulation C sharp](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m19s)

[yeah I can understand it there are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m28s)

[certainly days where coding is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m30s)

[it's it feels like a frustration and a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m32s)

[chore but for me it is also my uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m35s)

[it's also my relaxation activity](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m39s)

[so people think I'm weird because I will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m42s)

[that people think I'm weird I am](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m46s)

[definitely weird](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m48s)

[uh let's see we're gonna do that clean](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m51s)

[this up because we don't need all that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m53s)

[are you unhappy about oh double Escape](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h09m57s)

[there we are](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m00s)

[although I didn't help myself by picking](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m03s)

[an old language how old did you go like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m04s)

[C](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m07s)

[are we are we talking yield in days like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m08s)

[like cobal or](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m11s)

[Pascal or how old can we go heaven](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m14s)

[forbid Cobalt](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m17s)

[does it say it could have been worse it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m21s)

[could have been Punch Cards](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m23s)

[it could have definitely been worse](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m24s)

[Fortran as well ah there's the one I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m28s)

[miss](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m31s)

[yeah though](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m35s)

[people who have there's only a handful](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m37s)

[of places that that hire like Cobalt and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m39s)

[Fortran developers but the places that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m42s)

[are still stuck on Cobalt and Fortran](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m44s)

[like they're really stuck and they pay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m46s)

[really well](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m49s)

[like I've heard some ridiculous uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m51s)

[numbers that some old Cobalt developers](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m54s)

[are like yeah why would I update I I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m56s)

[make six figures and usually like three](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h10m59s)

[four hundred thousand dollars I'm like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m02s)

[I'm sorry what that's like it's because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m03s)

[there's you know no one out that does it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m09s)

[it's like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m10s)

[man for for for that dollar figure I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m11s)

[might have to go learn Cobalt and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m15s)

[Fortran](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m17s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m20s)

[okay a lot oh that's right I was going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m24s)

[back to my test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m26s)

[that's where I was going](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m27s)

[oh thanks for the follow-up I appreciate](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m29s)

[it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m31s)

[uh uh okay we have some tests that we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m32s)

[were doing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m36s)

[hey why is the test red](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m38s)

[test should be green now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m40s)

[run](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m42s)

[oh I probably I probably terminated it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m45s)

[there that's okay good whoo sorry relief](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m51s)

[unit tests should be green](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m53s)

[okay so let's go in here and we're gonna](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m55s)

[slap on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m57s)

[if you want to test light we want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h11m59s)

[test Dark theme as well because Dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m01s)

[theme is a thing](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m04s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m06s)

[as I can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m32s)

[uh she asked me a few weeks ago she's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m33s)

[like if I let you inherit the Mac will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m35s)

[you promise to not get rid of it I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m38s)

[like okay I make fun of Max yes but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m44s)

[but this thing is uh is a genuine](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h12m44s)

[uh it definitely is I will say learning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h13m55s)

[C is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h13m58s)

[it feels like a very worthwhile](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m00s)

[um endeavor](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m04s)

[it's one of those because it's at the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m07s)

[core](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m09s)

[um of so many languages depending on](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m11s)

[what you're trying to do on Unix it's C](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m14s)

[plus plus might be a little bit easier](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m16s)

[like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m19s)

[C plus plus is still close to the metal](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m20s)

[with so but it's not like true antcc](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m24s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m30s)

[oh that's actually going to be a problem](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m42s)

[isn't it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h14m57s)

[uh oh interesting so the way I've tested](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m00s)

[this it doesn't actually matter if it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m02s)

[light or dark just that the brush is set](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m04s)

[it's recorded now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m08s)

[back from 91. yeah I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m13s)

[remember which](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m15s)

[because she's showing it to me and it is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m18s)

[ye tiny screened](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m24s)

[but yes she did make me promise to not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m28s)

[get rid of it which I which I did](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m30s)

[it's like don't worry we will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m34s)

[we will guard it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m36s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m38s)

[make sure the new tests run](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m41s)

[and in theory](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m44s)

[this whole theming thing should just](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m48s)

[work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m50s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m53s)

[there we go colorful boxes colorful](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m54s)

[boxes yes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h15m58s)

[yeah this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m17s)

[this doesn't quite match](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m20s)

[yeah this is somewhat similar to the one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m27s)

[that she has](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m31s)

[it's somewhere in this vicinity this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m35s)

[isn't exactly right but it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m37s)

[of the images I'm seeing this kind of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m40s)

[thing here is very similar so hers must](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m42s)

[be an apple II or similar as well](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m45s)

[uh it is well hang on let me think I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m53s)

[trying to remember now yes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m55s)

[yes color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h16m58s)

[yes I'm pretty sure the answer is yes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m01s)

[some occasionally I get my my memories](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m05s)

[confused when I at a a long time ago](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m08s)

[before I actually got a job in software](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m12s)

[development I worked at a motorcycle](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m14s)

[shop and I did](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m20s)

[uh they they found out that I was tech](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m21s)

[savvy and at a motorcycle shop pretty](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m24s)

[much no one there is tech savvy ever at](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m26s)

[least in my area I I worked with several](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m29s)

[different shops and no one there knows](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m31s)

[computers at all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m33s)

[um so it didn't take much to be the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m35s)

[techie but I was working with an old](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m36s)

[Unix server and they would use](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m39s)

[um wise 50 dump terminals](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m46s)

[uh and these things were just a beast to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m49s)

[deal with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m51s)

[I yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m53s)

[these these ugly things](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m56s)

[these were a pain](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h17m59s)

[um though the keyboards we had actually](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m02s)

[had the old school function buttons all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m04s)

[the way up to f24](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m08s)

[uh not classic](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m09s)

[oh yes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m17s)

[yes I this is looking much closer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m23s)

[this is looking closer](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m30s)

[I think so I want to say](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m33s)

[I want to say like this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m36s)

[m0420](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m39s)

[but now I'm wondering if my brain is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m45s)

[Playing Tricks on what I remember I but](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m47s)

[I I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m50s)

[want to say that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h18m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m12s)

[uh no not the colored shell because I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m14s)

[remember those back from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m17s)

[the even though I was homeschooled I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m19s)

[took classes at the one of the local](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m22s)

[public schools and they had the old](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m24s)

[school colored shell ones and not that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h19m27s)

[things were such a pain](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m08s)

[oh the the the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m11s)

[ugly G3 colored shell ones](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m13s)

[trying to get my hands on one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m15s)

[I loved it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m18s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m20s)

[I remember we went because so I was I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m22s)

[was homeschooled all the way up until](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m25s)

[like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m27s)

[10th grade](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m30s)

[but we would go but because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m32s)

[homeschoolers in our area had like you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m33s)

[could you could almost do school a la](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m36s)

[carte where you could go in and take](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m38s)

[whatever classes you wanted](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m40s)

[so we would go in and uh do like art](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m41s)

[classes or robotics or things like that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m45s)

[where it wasn't necessarily always easy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m47s)

[to do at home](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m48s)

[um and I remember the robotics class we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m50s)

[took we spent more time fighting with](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m53s)

[that Mac getting it to control this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m56s)

[stupid little robot arm that actually](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h20m58s)

[like programming it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m00s)

[oh we got really good going through the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m04s)

[manual and like a buddy of mine and I we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m07s)

[would sit there and we would read the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m10s)

[manual and I think by the end of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m11s)

[year the teacher would just have us fix](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m12s)

[it because it's like you guys have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m14s)

[actually read the whole book it's like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m16s)

[yeah out of frustration](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m18s)

[we only read it because we couldn't make](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m20s)

[it work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m22s)

[okay cool I think I like where that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m25s)

[landed let's put that in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m28s)

[um themes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m31s)

[yeah uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m33s)

[last of the cleanup and remaining tests](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m37s)

[okay so I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m42s)

[I'm going to push this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m45s)

[this is pretty close I am](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m47s)

[I'm I am getting very close to saying I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m54s)

[want to merge 5.0 in to the the main](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m57s)

[branch and ship it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h21m59s)

[um or at least get it merged in and say](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m03s)

[that 5.0 is going to be the next release](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m05s)

[I've been kind of dragging my feet](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m07s)

[because if something comes up in the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m09s)

[current release I want to be able to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m11s)

[kick a four nine without too much hassle](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m12s)

[but I can always back up and Branch off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m14s)

[a prior commit or something if that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m17s)

[becomes an issue](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m21s)

[I think the only other thing that is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m23s)

[remaining](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m25s)

[uh is I was going to deal with so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m28s)

[I want to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m32s)

[I want to put in an MS build task](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m34s)

[because I don't think I want to check in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m37s)

[those files I'm trying to decide whether](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m41s)

[I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m43s)

[the process to be if somebody edits this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m45s)

[thing that they have to go run this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m48s)

[command line manually](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m49s)

[or if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m51s)

[or if I want it to be automatic](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m53s)

[and have it uh just magically kick off](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m56s)

[because I can Ms build does a remarkably](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h22m58s)

[good job if you point it at a set of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m01s)

[input files and a set of output files it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m04s)

[actually keeps track of like last](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m06s)

[modified dates on the files and will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m09s)

[conditionally run if something's out of](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m12s)

[date](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m15s)

[which is like perfect you just have to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m16s)

[tell it here's my input thingies here's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m18s)

[my output thingies do the rest right](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m20s)

[figure out where I go in the build](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m23s)

[orders figure out when I if I need to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m25s)

[run which is perfect and so I was](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m28s)

[contemplating setting that up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m31s)

[because ultimately the input is this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m33s)

[thing here the problem is is the outputs](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m36s)

[are spread across multiple projects](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m39s)

[and Ms build runs on a per project basis](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m42s)

[so it would have to reevaluate that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m45s)

[at every project](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m48s)

[and I'm wondering if that just becomes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m51s)

[problematic I I almost wonder if maybe I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m52s)

[should ask that idea](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m54s)

[I might end up axing it this may end up](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h23m57s)

[becoming a lost cause of just not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m00s)

[bothering to generate it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m07s)

[I think then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m09s)

[one of the LA the other things too](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m12s)

[though is I would like to nest](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m14s)

[the the generated files under it so for](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m17s)

[example we've got this theme extensions](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m19s)

[and theme extensions G right here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m21s)

[these guys](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m24s)

[um the the whole tree structure here in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m26s)

[Visual Studio is customizable and what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m28s)

[I'd love to do is say if something ends](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m31s)

[in a dot g dot CS extension Nest it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m33s)

[underneath the the thing above it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m36s)

[because most of the time people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m39s)

[shouldn't be touching the generated](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m41s)

[files anyway](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m43s)

[like they're set up they're marked as](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m46s)

[Auto generated they look like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m47s)

[auto-generated files](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m49s)

[um I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h24m52s)

[yeah I should also probably make sure no](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m00s)

[abilities turned on for all of them too](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m02s)

[because you could do it right here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m06s)

[couldn't you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m08s)

[I'm wondering if I just tack it onto my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m11s)

[header](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m13s)

[that's probably an easy win](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m19s)

[just do it right there but I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m22s)

[I'm probably going to shoot myself in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m23s)

[the foot by doing it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m25s)

[whatever we're doing it we're doing it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m26s)

[it's gonna it'll bite me](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m29s)

[uh let's see so I want to go here I want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m32s)

[to go here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m34s)

[I want to go pound](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m36s)

[level enable and then I want to hunt](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m37s)

[wherever else I put this in because I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m40s)

[think I put it in other places](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m42s)

[whack that because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m45s)

[doesn't need to live in multiple places](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m54s)

[oh it's just there okay great Regen](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h25m56s)

[because I am planning on checking in all](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m04s)

[of these files](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m06s)

[so it turns no ability on turns no](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m07s)

[ability oh that's what I didn't do I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m10s)

[didn't go clean up the theme class](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m11s)

[I need to kill off all those little](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m14s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m16s)

[yeah so pretty much all of you should be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m18s)

[dead now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m21s)

[if you aren't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m22s)

[you're about to be](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m24s)

[I'm I am still trying to decide if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m26s)

[want to move these primary and secondary](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m28s)

[ones into some sort of generated area](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m29s)

[too](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m31s)

[okay paper is still set here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m33s)

[what is going on with you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m37s)

[so this is for the color adjustment if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m46s)

[this comes in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m49s)

[color adjustment says to adjust it wants](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m51s)

[to set it onto the background color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m55s)

[so this is fine we can easily update](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h26m57s)

[these](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m00s)

[let's go there](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m01s)

[so this is actually one of the features](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m04s)

[that I was most proud of that I think](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m06s)

[it kind of skirts over people's eyes a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m09s)

[lot is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m11s)

[you could pick one of the built-in color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m13s)

[themes from Material design and they're](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m15s)

[going to have a reasonable contrast](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m18s)

[between your background and foreground](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m19s)

[but I also let people because sometimes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m21s)

[people have like Graphics designers and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m24s)

[whatnot](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m26s)

[um and they will and they don't like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m28s)

[like the 13 or whatever built-in color](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m29s)

[themes and they want to do their](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m31s)

[their own colors great fine style it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m34s)

[make it look how you want so I I have](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m36s)

[this custom color theme that you can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m38s)

[specify](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m39s)

[but one of the the drawbacks to custom](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m41s)

[colors or even sometimes if you let the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m43s)

[users pick their own colors right if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m45s)

[they pick white as their foreground and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m47s)

[white is their background that looks](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m49s)

[like crap you can't see anything](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m50s)

[um I do have this color adjustment](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m54s)

[option that can get set and what that'll](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m55s)

[end up doing is it will take the colors](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h27m58s)

[um and it will it'll tweak your primary](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m01s)

[uh and secondary colors and turn them](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m05s)

[either darker or lighter to achieve an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m08s)

[acceptable uh contrast ratio between the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m11s)

[foreground and background](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m14s)

[so the the material design project has](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m18s)

[you can see the default is 4.5 there's a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m20s)

[nice uh IEEE document about how to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m24s)

[calculate color ratios and what's the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m27s)

[appropriate size for large text like a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m30s)

[heading or small text like book content](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m32s)

[or similar so if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m35s)

[I scope the namespace while I'm in here](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m40s)

[so if if you care more about legibility](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m42s)

[then exact color values](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m45s)

[I suggest turning it on but some people](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m48s)

[are really picky they're like no no](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m50s)

[we're a designer darn it don't touch our](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m51s)

[colors leave them alone okay great it's](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m53s)

[an opt-in feature just don't opt in](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m56s)

[problem solve and you can have whatever](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h28m58s)

[colors you want but if you care about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m00s)

[legibility and don't care as much about](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m02s)

[colors you can turn it on I tend to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m04s)

[leave it on especially if I let users](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m06s)

[pick their own color themes that way it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m08s)

[kind of protects the user from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m10s)

[themselves of saying oh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m12s)

[you know I can customize it but I can't](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m15s)

[shoot myself in the foot and make my](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m18s)

[foregrounded background match or](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m19s)

[something](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m21s)

[uh okay I think we're gonna go with that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m23s)

[and I think I may have just talked](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m25s)

[myself into the idea of making the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m27s)

[of just making this thing a documented](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m30s)

[tool that if you change the brushes you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m33s)

[have to go and run it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m35s)

[I think I'm going to ax that for now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m37s)

[I might Circle back to it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m40s)

[we'll see](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m44s)

[and these ones I'm trying to decide if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m46s)

[end up updating or not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m49s)

[because these ones here the secondary](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m51s)

[ones the only reason these are being](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m54s)

[done kind of weird like this is because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h29m59s)

[previously the secondary uh brushes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m00s)

[didn't have this stuff and so this is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m03s)

[smoothing over older uh keys to make](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m06s)

[backwards compatibility work](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m10s)

[but I'm somewhat tempted to burn those](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m13s)

[down to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m16s)

[and force them to update](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m18s)

[we'll look at we'll look at that at a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m24s)

[later point](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m26s)

[that'll be a look at at a later point](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m27s)

[more cleanup okay I think with that I'm](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m31s)

[going to jump back we'll go and review](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m34s)

[tonight's brain teaser and then I may](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m36s)

[call it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m38s)

[because it's 11 30 my time and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m39s)

[I've got a 7 A.M call](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m43s)

[so](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m45s)

[the 7 A.M call is being recorded and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m47s)

[we'll be posted probably the week of the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m49s)

[28th so that'll be I will share that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m52s)

[when it comes out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m55s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m56s)

[so tonight's brain teaser](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h30m58s)

[was was a great one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m00s)

[um so for anyone who wasn't around uh at](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m03s)

[the beginning](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m06s)

[uh Stephen Taub has posted possibly one](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m07s)

[of the greatest blog posts of his that I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m12s)

[have ever read and he's written quite a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m14s)

[few good ones](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m16s)

[um he is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m17s)

[I think potentially the best possible](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m18s)

[person in the world to learn async and a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m20s)

[weight in C sharp from](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m23s)

[I I don't know how many people would](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m25s)

[fight me on that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m29s)

[he is excellent but as you can see this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m29s)

[is not a blog post this is a short novel](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m32s)

[so if you want to dive very deep he goes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m35s)

[all the way through the history of what](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m39s)

[is the feature how did we get here how](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m41s)

[all the internals work it is absolutely](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m44s)

[gold so if the title excites you the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m47s)

[rest of the content will be amazing if](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m49s)

[the title makes you want to like turn](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m51s)

[and run screaming I recommend you not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m54s)

[waste your time reading it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m56s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m57s)

[for the brain teaser we have a very](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h31m58s)

[simple unit test here where we](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m01s)

[instantiate a new object we then](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m03s)

[promptly await the object to get a](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m05s)

[string back and then we assert that the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m07s)

[string is oh no no no no no](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m09s)

[which is quite simple in fact now the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m11s)

[goal here is to make this unit test not](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m14s)

[only compile but pass](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m16s)

[but you're not allowed to edit the unit](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m19s)

[test in any way](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m21s)

[so that's the brain teaser](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m23s)

[I'll give people you know five seconds](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m26s)

[if you want to pause the video before I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m28s)

[throw spoilers at you](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m30s)

[oh if you would like](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m32s)

[before I do that boom if anybody wants](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m35s)

[to to pause and go look at the repo](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m38s)

[there's the repo for it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m40s)

[okay three two one solution in time](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m43s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m46s)

[so the the magical solution here looks](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m47s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m51s)

[is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m53s)

[we declare a new static class and the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m54s)

[reason it's a static class is because](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m57s)

[we're going to put an extension method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h32m58s)

[inside of it and extension methods can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m01s)

[only live inside of static classes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m03s)

[in this case we're going to do an](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m06s)

[extension method called get a waiter](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m07s)

[with the target type of object so you'll](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m09s)

[note we now magically compile](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m11s)

[so the idea with async and a weight is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m14s)

[when you await an object you can only](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m17s)

[await an awaitable thingy that's not the](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m19s)

[technical word Stephen Taub has much](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m23s)

[better words](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m24s)

[um so I think he uses task like object](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m26s)

[but the emphasis is the the like it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m28s)

[doesn't it's not tied to a particular](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m31s)

[type that you can wait and the reason](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m33s)

[they did this was for backwards](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m35s)

[compatibility they wanted to be able to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m36s)

[bring this type of async and a weight](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m39s)

[pattern to objects that were never](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m42s)

[intended to have it and especially](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m45s)

[things in some of the lower level](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m47s)

[libraries](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m49s)

[can't really make a lot of changes to](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m51s)

[them without people freaking out](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m53s)

[um or risk of breaking changes which is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m56s)

[why they allow you to do the extension](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h33m58s)

[methods which is awesome right so we can](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m00s)

[now await our object and the the rule is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m03s)

[the method has to be called get a waiter](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m06s)

[and it has to return an awaitable thingy](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m08s)

[right and an awaitable fee is classified](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m11s)

[as something that implements I notify](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m14s)

[completion which the I notify completion](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m17s)

[interface is just this method](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m20s)

[and as you can see my implementation](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m22s)

[isn't exactly brilliant](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m24s)

[it must have a property called is](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m27s)

[completed](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m29s)

[which in my case](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m30s)

[we're just setting it to true](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m32s)

[and then it must have a method called](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m34s)

[get result](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m36s)

[if you are doing this for a uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m37s)

[uh an async method where you don't want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m42s)

[to return value effectively you you want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m45s)

[the equivalent of like async task type](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m47s)

[Behavior your get result just becomes](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m49s)

[void](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m51s)

[um in fact I can show that because if I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m53s)

[do uh void there and](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m56s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h34m59s)

[something like that right this now](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m01s)

[squawks and goes you can't convert void](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m03s)

[to string](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m05s)

[which is pretty pretty cool okay so uh](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m06s)

[so in this case we've just hard-coded](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m10s)

[our get result to return the string that](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m12s)

[we want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m15s)

[now we run our test](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m18s)

[and test goes green](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m24s)

[yay passing test so there's the solution](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m26s)

[um you can wait anything you want](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m31s)

[um as long as it meets](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m36s)

[these uh awaitable re requirements](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m38s)

[and for a ton more details](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m42s)

[see Stephen tab's amazing blog post I](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m45s)

[cannot speak highly enough of it](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m49s)

[so that is the brain teaser I will](https://youtu.be/LKmV1I4Y0K4?t=02h35m51s)
