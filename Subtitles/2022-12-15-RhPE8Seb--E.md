[okay enough enough with the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m01s)

[interjections uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m04s)

[cool that's kind of a big deal isn't it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m06s)

[it's like a it's like a at least a half](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m08s)

[day event right it is a half day event](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m11s)

[and I think we're only charging like 20](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m13s)

[or 30 bucks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m15s)

[for it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m17s)

[cool and you get to hang out with us](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m18s)

[which is just awesome](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m20s)

[so best part I I mean well it depends on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m23s)

[who you are but yes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m25s)

[uh this is your Intrepid PL by the way](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m28s)

[uh oh okay so don't say anything bad](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m31s)

[about Alan I was about to get to him in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m34s)

[a minute but apparently we shouldn't say](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m36s)

[bad things about him because he's now](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m39s)

[watching the stream uh okay so quick](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m40s)

[backstory Alan came to me or didn't come](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m43s)

[to me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m46s)

[Alan is our Intrepid uh let's see](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m47s)

[19poker.com I think is what it is he is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m51s)

[our amazing product owner scrum Master](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m54s)

[extraordinaire uh absolutely amazing to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h02m56s)

[work with also can double as an MC in a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m00s)

[pinch uh because he is awesome and we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m02s)

[tend to use this pointing poker website](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m05s)

[and there's quite a few different sites](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m07s)

[online that do this same type of thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m09s)

[so typically in your scrum planning](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m11s)

[meeting you know product owner comes in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m13s)

[with story team discusses it and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m16s)

[the idea is to figure out okay well how](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m18s)

[big is this thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m20s)

[and so people go through different](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m21s)

[different uh kind of pointing sessions](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m23s)

[and this one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m26s)

[um we've used quite a bit but we also](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m28s)

[run into issues with reliability it goes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m30s)

[down every so often it is a light theme](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m32s)

[not a dark theme](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m34s)

[saying that's a selling point but it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m36s)

[might it might be a selling point](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m39s)

[um and so I figure I was like you know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m41s)

[this this is a fairly simple concept](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m44s)

[let's just build it if nothing else](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m46s)

[it'll be fun so that that was kind of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m48s)

[the premise of where we were going is we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m51s)

[were looking to do something that can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m53s)

[solve this problem and it and it needs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m55s)

[to be simple like to Ellen's credit when](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h03m57s)

[I asked him for a list of features](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m00s)

[he is aggressive when it comes to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m02s)

[trimming things down to MVP like he will](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m04s)

[strip out anything that isn't absolutely](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m07s)

[required](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m09s)

[um which he did so we gotta we gotta we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m11s)

[gotta GitHub repo and I should also warn](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m14s)

[you Alan has apparently decided that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m16s)

[he's doubling his Dev because he got the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m19s)

[first pull request on this repo](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m23s)

[he's he's not to be see not to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m25s)

[trifled with he will commit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m27s)

[and push and then I put in Branch](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m30s)

[policies to slow him down a little bit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m31s)

[um but underneath the issues we've got a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m35s)

[milestone](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m37s)

[and on the Milestone if you hit the show](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m38s)

[more this is basically the list of MVP](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m41s)

[features and I think there might have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m46s)

[even been a yeah I think like non-14 is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m47s)

[well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m52s)

[attractive well-designed that one's a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m53s)

[little more subjective but this was the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m55s)

[set of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m57s)

[MVP features that need to be in for this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h04m58s)

[thing to be usable for at least some of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m01s)

[our teams so if the question is what are](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m03s)

[we doing I then wrote a bunch of issues](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m06s)

[around these types of things of what I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m09s)

[think needs to happen we may find more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m11s)

[we may we may need to refine some of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m13s)

[these things but this is this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m16s)

[effectively what we're trying to build](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m18s)

[does that kind of make sense](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m20s)

[a little bit stop me I for everyone oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m21s)

[so I warned I warned everyone else](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m25s)

[um or I should say I warned Reese and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m28s)

[Jared earlier that I only brought one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m29s)

[Mountain Dew with me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m31s)

[um so we'll see how long I can go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m32s)

[tonight but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m34s)

[I brought one Mountain Dew with me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m36s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m39s)

[so Kevin can we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m41s)

[could we take a few minutes to see how](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m47s)

[how the existing application works can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m49s)

[we demo it real quick sure well so the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m51s)

[existing app as I've deployed or or the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m54s)

[one kind of replacing type thing the one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m57s)

[we're replacing yeah because I've never](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h05m59s)

[used this before no so that's that is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m01s)

[perfect so you come in here you put in a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m03s)

[name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m05s)

[um I've been just repeatedly adding an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m06s)

[increment to my name for no reason](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m07s)

[whatsoever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m09s)

[um and then I need to remember actually](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m11s)

[how to set this up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m16s)

[uh okay Intrepid uh po help](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m18s)

[button oh start a session see](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m23s)

[readings op](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m27s)

[slightly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m36s)

[slightly delayed](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m37s)

[you started a retrospective oh well so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m40s)

[that's not what I want I want a session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m43s)

[start a session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m45s)

[I come in here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m48s)

[and then start a session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m50s)

[it says pointing session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m56s)

[I don't know what I'm doing I'm not the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h06m58s)

[scrum master I just joined these things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m01s)

[join session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m04s)

[oh look at that okay here we go so five](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m06s)

[two two yeah so here and I'll I'll send](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m09s)

[you guys the link](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m13s)

[and you can drop in so that's the other](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m15s)

[thing that that is I guess somewhat](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m17s)

[implied we aren't doing like auth](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m19s)

[related stuff here right so typically](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m22s)

[through the course of this like if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m25s)

[somebody joins in that you type in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m27s)

[whatever name you want like you typed in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m29s)

[Jared but for all I know this is evil](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m31s)

[hacker twin Jared and not really you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m34s)

[that that's okay so so is the idea this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m37s)

[app then just super lightweight we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m40s)

[talking about like an issue and a Sprint](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m43s)

[and then we all just instead of saying](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m45s)

[what our vote is we could just pop it in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m47s)

[here and say Jared votes it's a five](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m49s)

[correct yeah the idea being to hopefully](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m51s)

[mitigate a little bit of you know well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m53s)

[Jared said a five so I I was gonna say a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h07m57s)

[13 but maybe I'm gonna say a five](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m00s)

[instead right eliminating a little bit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m02s)

[of that peer pressure thing and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m04s)

[then you know at the end you hit the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m07s)

[show votes you see how they are there's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m09s)

[a little there's a a story or two](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m11s)

[written up around kind of how we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m13s)

[going to show these like ordering and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m15s)

[grouping them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m17s)

[um so that it's clear you know wear](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m18s)

[things out Alan usually tends to just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m20s)

[uh either go for like an average or if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m23s)

[there if there's a widespread get some](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m26s)

[discussion until until the team kind of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m27s)

[starts to converge in on some agreement](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m30s)

[where you know maybe one person says oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m32s)

[no this is definitely like a 13 and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m34s)

[here's why and yada yada or what are you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m36s)

[guys talking about that's a text change](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m38s)

[it's a one pointer like what are you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m40s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m41s)

[sure so yeah or Alan puts in the chat we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m42s)

[don't want devs to defer to the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m45s)

[perceived best Dev right because I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m46s)

[all I would do is defer to Jared all day](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m50s)

[long and we can't have that so we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m51s)

[wouldn't get anything done and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m54s)

[clear votes is just effectively reset](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m56s)

[the board to go back over and Away you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h08m59s)

[go so there's there's not a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m01s)

[here and it's fairly simple and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m04s)

[straightforward](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m06s)

[um I thought it was interesting they](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m08s)

[have a API you can click on too right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m09s)

[there yeah to be able to go through and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m12s)

[hit it and that's the I you know and if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m13s)

[it wasn't for some of the like the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m16s)

[reliability bits that we've seen like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m17s)

[like this site does do really like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m20s)

[there's a few weird things with it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m24s)

[um but other than that like it's pretty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m27s)

[close](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m30s)

[like they've got some story descriptions](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m31s)

[and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m33s)

[UI is kind of weird yeah yeah it doesn't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m35s)

[have a coffee button either](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m38s)

[which is definitely a problem it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m40s)

[definitely needs a Mountain Dew a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m42s)

[Mountain Dew button and that's true I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m44s)

[think I think Alan worded it as abstain](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m46s)

[but yes that's basically what we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m48s)

[talking about](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m50s)

[um or some people use the coffee button](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m53s)

[to be we're done pointing stories let's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m55s)

[move on and go somewhere else but that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h09m57s)

[that's effectively what the the the idea](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m00s)

[here is if that if that all makes sense](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m03s)

[so a lot of these stories are just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m06s)

[around kind of basic level Pages like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m09s)

[their join page there was a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m11s)

[they've got this story description](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m14s)

[they've got these sessions and all of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m15s)

[that stuff we don't need all that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m18s)

[garbage like we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m19s)

[small well we'll we'll we'll probably](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m21s)

[add more as we go and then hopefully the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m24s)

[reliability is well since I'm the one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m26s)

[hosting it in Azure slightly more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m29s)

[reliable like I don't know if this site](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m30s)

[just occasionally buckles under its](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m32s)

[popularity](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m34s)

[which is possible because we've been in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m35s)

[the middle of sessions and all of a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m37s)

[sudden people get kicked and that kind](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m38s)

[of thing it's like I don't know what's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m40s)

[going on but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m41s)

[maybe ours won't be as popular and if we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m44s)

[do get popular and we have to like rev](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m46s)

[and scale out sure so be it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m48s)

[so there's there's there's what we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m50s)

[building](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m53s)

[there's the repo](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m54s)

[okay let's let's talk code then a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m55s)

[bit because somebody may have had some](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h10m58s)

[fun the other night at building stuff so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m01s)

[I'm going to close all my tabs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m03s)

[uh oh this is this is the wrong one this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m06s)

[is the hackathon repo so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m08s)

[for anybody who didn't catch that see](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m11s)

[YouTube stream](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m13s)

[um other visuals and that was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m17s)

[essentially the same stack right it was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m18s)

[basically the same stack and I've](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m21s)

[shamelessly stolen some of this exact](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m23s)

[setup that we did because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m26s)

[I kind of like the setup that we did](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m27s)

[during that hackathon it it worked](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m29s)

[really well for our team I can't speak](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m31s)

[to Reese's team but like this was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m33s)

[effectively the the setup that we've got](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m35s)

[so I know ours was oh pretty much the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m38s)

[same I think it that's what it comes out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m41s)

[of the box right when it is to a new](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m43s)

[project this is pretty close to file new](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m44s)

[project but there's a couple the couple](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m47s)

[key things that I've changed so uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m48s)

[things like editor config are cleaned up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m51s)

[I fixed up their the generated](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m54s)

[um GitHub action so that it works for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h11m58s)

[things like PR's because the default one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m00s)

[doesn't give you PR stuff out of the box](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m02s)

[I threw in dependabot because what I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m04s)

[really love every Sunday night is lots](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m07s)

[of emails about my nuget packages being](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m09s)

[updated](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m11s)

[so that's exciting if I get motivated](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m11s)

[I'll add another thing in here to Auto](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m13s)

[accept dependabot PR so I don't even](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m15s)

[have to click the buttons because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m17s)

[I'm too lazy for that I've done a bunch](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m19s)

[of stuff with like turning on null](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m22s)

[ability and implicit usings and adding](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m24s)

[to the using sets](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m26s)

[um in shared directory build props and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m29s)

[targets files this one's empty for the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m31s)

[moment but I do have that all set up the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m32s)

[test projects I also have additional](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m36s)

[Global using setup for things like X](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m38s)

[unit and auto mock](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m40s)

[um and then the package references close](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m43s)

[Robert Blazer which is just like WPF I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m45s)

[promise](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m48s)

[um but pulling all of these things in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m49s)

[this was the bug that I ran into earlier](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m51s)

[where](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m53s)

[when you add unit test projects your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m55s)

[deployment starts failing because you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m57s)

[accidentally publish your unit test](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h12m59s)

[projects by default if you don't set is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m00s)

[publishable false on all of them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m02s)

[so setting that up in one place so that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m05s)

[then my unit test projects my CS](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m07s)

[products for the unit test projects](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m09s)

[looks like that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m10s)

[which](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m12s)

[I I get real happy when I see a CS](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m14s)

[project that looks like that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m17s)

[this is like gold like I have done](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m19s)

[nothing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m22s)

[um but as you can see like the unit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m25s)

[tests themselves are just straight empty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m26s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m28s)

[I may have done a bunch of work for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m29s)

[nothing but it made me happy](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m31s)

[um the other thing I did is on the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m33s)

[client side so a lot of this is the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m35s)

[default out of the box and let me pull](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m38s)

[up you'll note I've changed the the the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m39s)

[main layout page just so that there's a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m43s)

[you know a little logo in the corner the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m46s)

[about shells out to Microsoft learn](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m48s)

[asp.net docs obviously that needs to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m50s)

[changed none of this stuff lines up but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m53s)

[a lot of the default pages from the file](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m55s)

[new project are somewhat useful so for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m57s)

[example if we go slash counter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h13m59s)

[load](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m06s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m10s)

[that was shockingly long for being on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m11s)

[localhost but we can do the click me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m14s)

[this is the one that I think will](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m16s)

[probably be the most educational for you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m18s)

[Jared uh so the so the counter page I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m21s)

[think like I left it in and I modified](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m27s)

[it to use the mvvm stuff but I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m29s)

[anticipate just throwing this thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m31s)

[completely away because this is just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m33s)

[their default example here's a button](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m35s)

[here's a count don't think it's going to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m37s)

[work just fine for you right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m39s)

[um but I updated it with sort of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m42s)

[structure that that we used before that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m44s)

[I kind of like so first thing to note](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m46s)

[that you're at page this is like your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m48s)

[routing stuff so I was able to hit uh on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m50s)

[my page slash counter to get to here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m54s)

[because it was declared like that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m57s)

[you'll note page title automatically](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h14m59s)

[sets it just like if you were doing like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m01s)

[the the title element in your your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m03s)

[header on your HTML page and then the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m06s)

[rest of this body in here because you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m08s)

[inside of a Razer uh template I I have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m10s)

[you done much with Razer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m14s)

[not so much](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m16s)

[now if you're asking me no okay I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m17s)

[just saying I know Reese is basically an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m20s)

[expert](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m22s)

[more or less](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m23s)

[I mean I I think I get the idea of it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m24s)

[it's it's a lot like um it's a lot like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m27s)

[Django in the sense of you were doing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m30s)

[server-side rendering](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m32s)

[really just blending HTML with C sharp](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m34s)

[is what it looks like at least yes the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m41s)

[the weird part is what's going to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m44s)

[server and what's not that's where](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m45s)

[that's where this starts to get a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m47s)

[more interesting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m48s)

[but you are absolutely correct so the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m50s)

[magical at symbol is what toggles you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m52s)

[between](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m54s)

[um HTML and C sharp mode as far as what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m55s)

[you're referencing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h15m59s)

[um and then you'll note I've got this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m00s)

[magical view model property this was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m01s)

[something that Kelly showed us and I I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m03s)

[imagine what he's actually going to talk](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m05s)

[about at that conference so if this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m07s)

[interesting to people come to conference](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m09s)

[Kelly will tell you more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m10s)

[um but this component base with a view](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m12s)

[model automatically registers up for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m15s)

[property change notifications](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m20s)

[and being able to do the after rendering](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m22s)

[normal normal mvvm stuff would register](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m25s)

[up and actually care which property](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m28s)

[changed this basically is forcing full](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m30s)

[refreshes on everything which at least](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m32s)

[for the simple stuff that we're doing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m35s)

[that won't be a performance problem](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m37s)

[but that's how when I come in here and I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m39s)

[have this view model uh increment count](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m43s)

[if I look at my counter view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m45s)

[I've got this little observable property](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m49s)

[my increment count just says current](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m51s)

[count plus plus](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m54s)

[and when I click](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m56s)

[this thing works by sheer magic](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h16m58s)

[so there there's a lot of things kind of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m00s)

[going on under the hood](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m03s)

[but let me let me unravel a few of them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m05s)

[so underneath the analyzers](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m08s)

[this is the community toolkit so people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m11s)

[who watch my WPF streams they're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m13s)

[familiar with this absolutely beautiful](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m15s)

[Library if you aren't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m18s)

[YouTube streams there's there's a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m20s)

[introduction video that's awesome](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m22s)

[um this guy here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m25s)

[um generates out a bunch of source code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m28s)

[for you so I wrote a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m30s)

[I I created a field a private field and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m34s)

[slapped an attribute on top of it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m37s)

[that attribute gets picked up by this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m40s)

[community toolkit Source generator and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m43s)

[it generates out a bunch of extra code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m45s)

[for me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m47s)

[effectively building out what WPF devs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m48s)

[would know as like an I notify property](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m51s)

[changed implementation where it uh the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m53s)

[setter for the property checks if the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m57s)

[new value is different if it's different](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h17m59s)

[then it'll assign the value to the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m00s)

[backing field and then appropriately](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m03s)

[raise the property changed event all of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m04s)

[that stuff that goes along with it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m06s)

[um but it means that in terms of what we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m09s)

[have to write if there's something that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m12s)

[you want to be notified of when it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m14s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m17s)

[make a field slap an attribute on it and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m18s)

[you're done](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m20s)

[and the rest of it just gets handled for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m21s)

[you all of that because in the component](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m23s)

[base it's watching for property changed](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m25s)

[and it's telling the the front end hey](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m27s)

[the states changed go ahead and do this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m30s)

[and this is where I was commenting that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m32s)

[there's a small difference when you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m35s)

[playing in Blazer about what server side](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m37s)

[and what's client-side because all of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m39s)

[this is happening client side](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m41s)

[this isn't there's no postbacks or any](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m44s)

[server-side generation here because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m46s)

[rather than writing with JavaScript we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m49s)

[get to play in webassembly instead](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m52s)

[so our C sharp gets compiled down into](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m55s)

[effectively IL for the browser and run](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h18m57s)

[there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m01s)

[and then for more fun we can attach a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m03s)

[debugger to it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m05s)

[um there is a there's a fun gotcha when](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m07s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m10s)

[if you if you open the dev Tools in your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m11s)

[browser a breakpoint in your browser](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m13s)

[will pause visual studio and vice versa](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m15s)

[and some people like it's great when you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m18s)

[realize that's what's happening and it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m21s)

[miserable when you go why is it not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m22s)

[responding](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m24s)

[yeah so she said 30 points check both](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m26s)

[because it can it can break you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m31s)

[but yeah Robert commented in the chat](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m32s)

[too that there's also things like code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m34s)

[blocks where you can literally start](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m36s)

[like if you want to dive in and do other](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m39s)

[stuff in here right I know if I do the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m41s)

[app with the curly braces I'm now free](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m44s)

[to you know start writing for loops and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m46s)

[do whatever I want in inside of code so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m48s)

[that's the that's the server side](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m51s)

[rendering bit or server side rendering](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m53s)

[is not quite the right word that's the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m56s)

[thing that would be closest to your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m58s)

[server-side rendering again this all](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h19m59s)

[gets shipped down to the client in one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m02s)

[package](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m03s)

[you can kind of see that I believe in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m05s)

[the dev tools yeah open](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m07s)

[pretty sure it shows it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m09s)

[pretty sure I didn't test any of this so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m11s)

[if we go sources I believe](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m15s)

[and I just hard refresh this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m19s)

[we should see the whole kit and caboodle](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m22s)

[come down that's part of why sometimes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m25s)

[this download is initially slow but once](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m27s)

[it's loaded it's fast](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m30s)

[um I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m33s)

[wasm is this the guy](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m35s)

[I think this is the guy that contains](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m39s)

[all of the stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m41s)

[which nobody wants to read this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m44s)

[so you can't really see then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m47s)

[so it's not transpiling everything into](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m52s)

[JavaScript correct it is not transpiling](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m55s)

[into JavaScript now that doesn't mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h20m58s)

[that you can't debug it right so for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m00s)

[example if we want to come in here right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m02s)

[and I I and I want to set a breakpoint](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m04s)

[and I come over here and I click me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m07s)

[like we can debug this that's pretty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m09s)

[that's really cool I guess the whole](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m12s)

[point sorry go ahead Reese I was gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m14s)

[say there is Javascript interop too that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m17s)

[is a lot of this happening yeah but yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m19s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m21s)

[because you can get back all the way if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m22s)

[you need to do javascripty stuff because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m25s)

[there's not something exposed you can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m28s)

[you can get back to it if you need to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m30s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m33s)

[there there is all of that which is kind](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m34s)

[of cool in my opinion so this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m36s)

[I left the the counter and then what was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m40s)

[the fetch data one so this is another](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m42s)

[one that's worth noting that again these](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m44s)

[are all the file new project bits but I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m47s)

[I left them in for the purposes of of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m48s)

[showing because I kind of felt like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m51s)

[we'll delete them when we're ready to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m53s)

[but they make for for good examples](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m55s)

[so this one here is pulling back data](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h21m58s)

[from a web API so you'll know the the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m01s)

[key thing when you're looking at this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m04s)

[the client project](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m06s)

[um this is the thing that's going to get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m08s)

[bundled up in that wasm package and ship](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m09s)

[down to the browser](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m12s)

[but there is just like you're used to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m14s)

[with the server side stuff there is a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m16s)

[like back-end controller so for example](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m19s)

[I've got this weather controller that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m21s)

[this matches the old asp.net core setup](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m23s)

[where it's just you know give me give me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m26s)

[the uh the weather upcoming right and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m29s)

[you can kind of see balmy freezy](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m32s)

[scorching and all of that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m33s)

[if we look over here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m35s)

[this is where you start to see some of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m37s)

[the other fun stuff so you can do di](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m39s)

[level injection](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m41s)

[and say yeah by the way give me an HTTP](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m43s)

[client](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m45s)

[and now I have now HTTP is now defined](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m47s)

[inside of this guy where I can access it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m50s)

[in code and you'll note down at the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m52s)

[bottom they have a code block and this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m54s)

[is this is the reason why I'll Circle](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m57s)

[back to the view model stuff but they](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h22m59s)

[then use the HTTP client to query](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m01s)

[the the weather forecast](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m05s)

[and the only way because the question](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m07s)

[then is if this client thing comes down](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m09s)

[to the browser how does this HTTP client](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m11s)

[know where this endpoint lives](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m14s)

[right like that's it's this isn't a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m16s)

[fully qualified URL and it needs to go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m18s)

[to you know localhost you know port](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m20s)

[number slash weather controller](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m23s)

[um but where that's actually coming from](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m27s)

[is inside of this guy's program when he](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m29s)

[gets compiled](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m32s)

[he uh his di registration registers an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m34s)

[HTTP client with the Base address](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m37s)

[already set to the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m40s)

[um the hosting environment space address](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m43s)

[so there's there's this fun thing where](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m47s)

[this server actually is what is running](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m50s)

[on the back end and serving everything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m52s)

[up but at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m55s)

[the browser is going to receive this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h23m58s)

[client package which gets sent down](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m00s)

[uh I'm trying to remember where all of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m05s)

[this gets kill the using while I'm in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m08s)

[here Boom die](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m10s)

[uh let's see add razor pages](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m11s)

[I'm trying to remember where the there's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m16s)

[the I it might be this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m18s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m22s)

[configures the application to serve](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m23s)

[Blazer webassembly framework files from](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m25s)

[the root so this magical guy here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m27s)

[is what's enabling the server to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m31s)

[actually send that wasm file down to the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m33s)

[browser](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m35s)

[so so the weather forecast string the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m38s)

[the request URI](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m42s)

[where else is that defined then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m44s)

[I mean I I see the controller for it but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m47s)

[I don't see the link between the two I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m50s)

[guess I still don't understand that no](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m52s)

[so that that is totally fine so yeah so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m53s)

[the so the the thing to note here and we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m56s)

[should let's just hit this guy real](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h24m58s)

[quick so when you s the the route name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m00s)

[here that's set with the square braces](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m03s)

[controller so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m05s)

[whether](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m08s)

[uh forecast because spelling counts](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m11s)

[so that's the actual to hit the API](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m14s)

[that's the full URL so it is just oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m17s)

[server slash weather forecast okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m21s)

[so yeah so there so there's the link so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m25s)

[this you can imagine is going to get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m27s)

[concatenated with the slash on the end](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m29s)

[of it for weather forecast and then the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m31s)

[the host address is what's getting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m33s)

[configured here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m36s)

[so that it knows how to link those](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m38s)

[things together so if it was nested more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m39s)

[deeply than that or you needed a deeper](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m41s)

[router pass query parameters or whatever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m42s)

[all of that goes there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m44s)

[um yeah the only thing that this doesn't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m48s)

[enable very well is when you want to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m52s)

[write tests over this like if you wanted](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m54s)

[to unit test this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m56s)

[is now a pain in the neck to unit test](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h25m58s)

[because you either have to go through](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m01s)

[one of the testing Frameworks or do UI](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m02s)

[tests or something or whatnot which this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m05s)

[is where where Kelly's Brilliance came](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m08s)

[he's like well this feels like an mvvm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m10s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m13s)

[let's just take the logic out of our](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m14s)

[view per se out of our razor file and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m17s)

[move it into a view model class that way](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m21s)

[we can have our view look like this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m24s)

[and our view model is now nothing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m27s)

[special right there's there's nothing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m29s)

[special about this counter view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m32s)

[class this is a regular c-sharp object](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m34s)

[yeah there's some Source generators but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m36s)

[these Source generators are just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m38s)

[generating properties](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m40s)

[at the end of the day I still have just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m41s)

[a c-sharp object with a property on it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m43s)

[and a public method](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m45s)

[done and that observable property is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m47s)

[that from a different](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m50s)

[um a toolkit or is that from the mvvm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m51s)

[one or that's from the community toolkit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m54s)

[mvvm Library so that so that one is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m56s)

[coming in Via this reference here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h26m59s)

[so that's where that magic comes from](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m03s)

[and we only picked this one up because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m05s)

[this library is quickly becoming the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m08s)

[most popular mvvm Library out there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m11s)

[um yeah I did a whole stream on their](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m15s)

[8-0 release and it blew my mind all of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m18s)

[the cool stuff that was in it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m21s)

[and so nice so now we keep using it for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m23s)

[everything because it is it is awesome](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m26s)

[and highly performant and amazing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m27s)

[so there's lots of libraries out there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m31s)

[that I'm sure would work this just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m33s)

[happened to be our favorite so we picked](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m34s)

[it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m38s)

[other questions does that make sense](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m39s)

[mm-hmm okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m41s)

[okay so given all of that let's go build](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m44s)

[something](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m47s)

[uh close close](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m49s)

[I gotta remember where my](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m53s)

[that's the dev tools I don't want the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m55s)

[dev tools close that nope](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h27m57s)

[so it sounds like for like um for the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m00s)

[client side the process would be what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m03s)

[creating a view model for whatever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m06s)

[you're wanting to build and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m09s)

[creating the razor page for it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m12s)

[absolutely simple it is very simple and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m16s)

[Kenny added an extra issue in here so we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m21s)

[aren't we're going to ignore that for a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m23s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m24s)

[um did you oh hey real quick when we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m25s)

[talking about the view models did you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m27s)

[come up with the rule of thumb like is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m29s)

[there is there some acceptable amount of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m31s)

[code that should be in the Razer file or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m32s)

[are you just going pure put all the code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m35s)

[in there even if it's maybe one function](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m37s)

[or you know what I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m39s)

[um I think the general rule of thumb](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m40s)

[that we went with is if it's anything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m42s)

[that's like business logicy that should](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m44s)

[be tested](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m46s)

[put it in the view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m47s)

[like it's okay to have code in the the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m49s)

[Razer page it's not like don't put any](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m52s)

[code in there ever but if it's a few](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m53s)

[specifics kind of stuff yeah perhaps](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m56s)

[maybe yeah but anything business](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h28m58s)

[logically related we tried to pull out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m00s)

[of our our Razer files](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m02s)

[the it and it really business logically](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m05s)

[came down to the definition of anything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m08s)

[we wanted to be able to test](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m09s)

[easily test okay yeah because because if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m12s)

[you don't write tests the benefits of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m15s)

[the view Model start to dwindle really](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m17s)

[fast](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m19s)

[um especially in a framework like this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m21s)

[that doesn't have over a lot of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m22s)

[Native binding stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m24s)

[so it's like oh yeah yeah a little more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m26s)

[overhead than it's worth maybe yeah so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m28s)

[that was really all it was was a a clean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m30s)

[separation](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m32s)

[so that we had a nice easy way of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m34s)

[bringing those things back and forth and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m35s)

[that was it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m39s)

[okay let's let's pick on one of these](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m41s)

[issues and then go ahead and attack it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m46s)

[this one seems easy Jared this one's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m48s)

[your name yeah I was trying to find that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m50s)

[low hanging fruit I thought perfect I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m54s)

[could do this perfect you're gonna lead](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m56s)

[a journal sure I mean like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h29m57s)

[so let's let's start with this based on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m02s)

[all that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m04s)

[where where do we go first for this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m05s)

[so it so the landing page it just said](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m08s)

[it wanted](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m11s)

[a link to create a session a link to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m12s)

[join a session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m16s)

[that was it yeah I think that's I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m18s)

[that's really again going for a tiny](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m21s)

[level MVP](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m24s)

[effectively if this page were easier for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m26s)

[me to look at](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m28s)

[yeah right there's a lot there's a lot](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m30s)

[of stuff here but I think what we need](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m32s)

[is this this and this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m34s)

[yeah they're about or their equivalence](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m37s)

[thereabouts](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m39s)

[right yeah then they got all their](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m40s)

[marketing stuff in there yeah and it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m42s)

[also I don't know uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m44s)

[so I should call out Alan real quick](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m47s)

[because he named this so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m50s)

[when I asked him what we were calling](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m53s)

[this he immediately jumped on pointer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m54s)

[star because this is how you do a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m56s)

[pointer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h30m59s)

[and we're pointing it I see what you did](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m00s)

[there I thought it was clever well I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m03s)

[don't get points for the name Alan Allen](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m06s)

[gets points for it um he also then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m07s)

[proceeded to then go and get the domain](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m09s)

[oh nice](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m13s)

[I wanted point](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m15s)

[uh oh this is pointing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m19s)

[pointer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m22s)

[I was gonna say that yeah there's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m24s)

[because I believe one of these uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m26s)

[yeah uh Alan does point out that star is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m31s)

[only it's supposed to be the little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m35s)

[asterisk in all cases unless we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m37s)

[talking about code or things where](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m39s)

[putting an asterisk wouldn't count in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m41s)

[which case the most spell outside why is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m43s)

[this thing not redirecting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m45s)

[the I thought we had set up uh uh so the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m47s)

[actual project should be called pointer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m51s)

[oh now Alan wants me to rename](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m54s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m57s)

[we aren't doing that tonight](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h31m59s)

[winter star it looks like we got it well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m01s)

[no he's he's positing that we should](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m04s)

[drop the uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m06s)

[the word star and just call it pointer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m08s)

[but that requires dropping for the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m13s)

[characters on the end of a lot of things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m14s)

[now I'm fine with a massive find and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m16s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m19s)

[anybody else working in the repo will](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m20s)

[probably hate me about that point](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m22s)

[because when you rename the repo on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m24s)

[GitHub you get all kinds of fun scary](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m25s)

[warnings like are you sure you're about](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m27s)

[to break all your hyperlinks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m29s)

[yep yeah we're just calling it pointers](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m31s)

[calling it pointer just pointer I will I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m35s)

[will do my best okay so this is this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m38s)

[the page that I think we want to go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m40s)

[through and put stuff on yeah so if this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m42s)

[if this were me I think the first thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m47s)

[I would do is an index.razer which is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m50s)

[already the landing page stub out some](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m53s)

[um and I'm not a UI designer whatsoever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h32m57s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m00s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m03s)

[um one button for taking you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m05s)

[um let's see the create session window](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m08s)

[or page and then uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m11s)

[another one for join a session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m13s)

[and I don't know if the join a session](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m16s)

[would have like a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m18s)

[some kind of number in room oh sorry](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m20s)

[it's called a room on the um in the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m23s)

[issue I don't know if that matters uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m26s)

[versus the yeah let me check I'm in the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m28s)

[naming sometimes you know no no you are](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m31s)

[good so I believe room was the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m34s)

[terminology I got from Alan so room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m37s)

[might be the better](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m39s)

[yeah we may want to go with room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m43s)

[yeah number one says the voting a voting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m46s)

[room yeah whether that was intentional](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m48s)

[or not uh Alan should know better than](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m51s)

[to give me words](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m53s)

[we will use room because that's a thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h33m56s)

[um the other thing I will point out is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m00s)

[so I pulled in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m02s)

[um some styling bits](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m04s)

[uh I will show those to you so it when](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m06s)

[it comes to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m10s)

[uh let's see styling I just picked one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m11s)

[because I wasn't given any directions](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m14s)

[and so I was like this looks pretty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m16s)

[let's use this so I so I did](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m19s)

[um but if oh okay yeah I thought that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m22s)

[looked nice too yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m24s)

[yeah so I literally went to one of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m26s)

[pages that has a whole bunch of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m29s)

[bootstrap themes and went that looks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m31s)

[pretty and that was the sum total of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m34s)

[uh thought that went into this uh there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m37s)

[was a little more thought in the I don't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m39s)

[want light theme](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m41s)

[so there was that because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m43s)

[yeah I wanted something with a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m46s)

[more darker feel to it because reasons](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m48s)

[um and then it looks nice yeah and if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m52s)

[you want the other thing is I should](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m55s)

[probably do a new tab](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h34m57s)

[there is so the I don't know if you guys](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m01s)

[are familiar with the bootstrap docs if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m04s)

[you want to know the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m06s)

[stuff available for you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m08s)

[for like building stuff out the the the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m10s)

[bootstrap docks are actually quite good](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m13s)

[we're seeing for seeing all the things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m16s)

[again so you just went ahead and kept](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m20s)

[the the stock bootstrap stuff it because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m22s)

[sometimes people change the styling out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m24s)

[or whatever yeah I was too lazy to do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m26s)

[that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m29s)

[but in terms of what we have at our](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m31s)

[disposal](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m33s)

[I figured start there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m34s)

[post MVP if or or when when somebody](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m36s)

[wants to play designer for me that'll](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m39s)

[work great](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m41s)

[oh no yeah no I think you did a good](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m42s)

[choice it looks good okay so I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m44s)

[I'm gonna clear some of this stuff out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m47s)

[for you Jared](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m51s)

[I don't recall if one of you guys knows](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m52s)

[off top your head correct me but the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m55s)

[bootstrap because they've got the nice](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m57s)

[grid stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h35m59s)

[what's the uh I know it starts like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m00s)

[you're talking about containers and yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m03s)

[this this thing for laying out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m06s)

[yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m09s)

[this be what I want that way we can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m11s)

[because I think that I think ultimately](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m15s)

[we want to kind of slap this stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m18s)

[inside of uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m19s)

[something like this do you guys have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m22s)

[preferences on how this ends up looking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m23s)

[what are you what are you no thinking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m26s)

[the simpler the better I guess yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m29s)

[and then what is the magical incantation](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m32s)

[uh you're talking about for uh buttons](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m36s)

[now or which one are you yeah I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m39s)

[looking at where because I we've got](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m41s)

[your two buttons and I was trying to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m43s)

[figure out how we actually wanted this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m44s)

[to lay out on the page itself](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m45s)

[mm-hmm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m47s)

[yeah so it's like uh if you use a Mt](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m49s)

[Dash](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m52s)

[um or actually sorry call col as the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m54s)

[class](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m57s)

[um you can specify](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h36m58s)

[um I I believe it's right these type of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m01s)

[things yeah so extra small or there's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m04s)

[medium](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m08s)

[so if you did like call uh call dash](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m09s)

[md4 for those two or md6 for those two](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m13s)

[it should split them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m17s)

[look the difference so so he's in kind](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m19s)

[of their own cell type thing is that the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m23s)

[yeah I mean you make them because then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m25s)

[they'd be two columns side by side on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m28s)

[the same row and sorry I think it's call](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m30s)

[Dash is it md6 or md-6 I don't remember](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m32s)

[I don't know I was uh Dash uh Dash yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m37s)

[and I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m43s)

[I think you can put on the row you could](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m45s)

[essentially say like this and and this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m48s)

[is I haven't read official documentation](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m51s)

[but I think you can put now let's just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m53s)

[try that see what happens](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m56s)

[well I'm trying to remember the Hot](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h37m58s)

[reload](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m00s)

[I've had very mixed results with](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m01s)

[so I usually wait about half a second](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m04s)

[and go I give up and then restart the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m06s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m08s)

[because the startup time is usually](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m09s)

[significantly less](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m11s)

[hot reload is one of those things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m14s)

[that like with the Net 7 stuff it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m17s)

[supposed to be just Flawless and it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m19s)

[it's not just flawless](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m21s)

[just it's kind of like data binding](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m24s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m26s)

[okay so we got button](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m28s)

[probably do anything but that's that's a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m32s)

[little better we can add some styling on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m34s)

[those too](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m37s)

[yeah and then we're gonna need something](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m38s)

[we're gonna need to slap something in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m42s)

[here I think for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m44s)

[because we're going to want the the join](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m47s)

[to have because I think we want to do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m50s)

[like one five or something because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m52s)

[the grid system's out of 12 isn't it in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m54s)

[bootstrap yeah I think so yeah it is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m56s)

[yeah okay so I just did six because then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h38m59s)

[it would split the right I'm just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m02s)

[thinking that we might wanna uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m04s)

[some sort of inputty thing there to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m08s)

[bring it in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m12s)

[oh so we're talking about for the are](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m15s)

[you talking about yeah the join room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m17s)

[number yeah for the join room we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m19s)

[going to need to take in some sort of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m21s)

[room number similar for it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m23s)

[really should just leave that issue open](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m25s)

[why do I keep closing it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m27s)

[yeah this is providing providing an ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m29s)

[to be able to join an existing one I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m32s)

[think yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m33s)

[and for now I think we'll just take an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m35s)

[arbitrary string or similar and we'll](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m37s)

[we'll lock it down more in a bit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m40s)

[um and I think if I remember right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m44s)

[sorry I'm gonna go steal](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m47s)

[when in doubt it's not stealing if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m49s)

[steal from yourself right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m52s)

[yeah you know what's interesting is now](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m54s)

[I'm thinking about this so to make it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h39m57s)

[it's this I you know I I think the idea](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m00s)

[of simple you kind of have to think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m04s)

[about how far to take it like super](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m08s)

[simple would be two buttons that's all](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m10s)

[there is you click click one to create](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m13s)

[your own room click another one to join](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m16s)

[a room and then as you get navigated you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m18s)

[know the create room handles its own](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m21s)

[problems and the join rooms handles its](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m23s)

[own problems so you could either just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m25s)

[click join room and then on the next](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m29s)

[page it gives you some prompts to put an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m30s)

[input as far as the join or the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m32s)

[number or you could do it here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m35s)

[um but you know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m39s)

[I was just thinking like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m41s)

[because whether you create your own room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m43s)

[or you join a room you need you're going](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m46s)

[to need to enter you know your name at](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m49s)

[least of who you are right so it almost](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m52s)

[makes me wonder do you put those things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m54s)

[at the index and you say](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m56s)

[um you know enter your name because no](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h40m59s)

[matter which way you go you're going to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m01s)

[need that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m02s)

[right I don't know this is why I well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m03s)

[I'm not a designer well and so in the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m06s)

[chat I don't know if you're watching the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m09s)

[twitch on Alan points out that he's like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m10s)

[I don't even think you need a join room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m12s)

[for MVP](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m14s)

[because you get a link from the the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m16s)

[creator](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m18s)

[so theoretically](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m20s)

[okay so let's go let's okay that'd be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m23s)

[simpler yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m26s)

[uh record Kevin I was gonna point out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m28s)

[too with those classes right there if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m31s)

[you hit control space when you're typing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m33s)

[it it gives you a little list of them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m35s)

[like if you get go back space a couple](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m37s)

[over the six oh yeah I like that too](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m40s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m43s)

[oh okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m48s)

[I'm just so used to web stuff never](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m50s)

[working](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m52s)

[yeah I think they finally got it it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m54s)

[okay so okay so what if we do something](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m57s)

[like this then right so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h41m59s)

[because look at that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m02s)

[guys I sent her to div](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m06s)

[ision does that kind of Center in a div](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m08s)

[oh man that's the hardest thing to do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m12s)

[here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m14s)

[does that count as Center in a div](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m18s)

[I say yeah sure I mean what do you say](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m21s)

[the proof maybe we should make sure that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m24s)

[we should make sure it works first oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m26s)

[yeah I guess we're gonna test it though](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m28s)

[yeah I mean I should at least launch it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m30s)

[to make sure that it works it compiles](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m32s)

[right skip it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m35s)

[there you go well let's at least let's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m37s)

[at least put a little styling on that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m40s)

[Kevin on that uh on that button throw a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m41s)

[class modifier in there and just do uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m44s)

[BTN space](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m47s)

[BTN Dash primary uh button primary](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m49s)

[that'll at least make it not look like a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m54s)

[windows 98.](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h42m57s)

[you apparently didn't see our hackathon](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m00s)

[project Jared we legitimately styled for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m02s)

[98. yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m05s)

[I think that hit a little too close to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m08s)

[home because that was like the first I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m11s)

[mean that was the first operating system](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m13s)

[I remember ever using as a kid and so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m14s)

[when I saw that I it made me think that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m17s)

[maybe there was some technologies out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m19s)

[there that people were using that just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m20s)

[like kept that styling I was like oh man](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m22s)

[um but yeah there's button I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m26s)

[button secondary will make it a lighter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m27s)

[color Okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m29s)

[um I'm fine with primary for now I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m31s)

[it's going to be the one big thing on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m33s)

[the screen so let's roll with it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m34s)

[um while we're in here before we get too](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m36s)

[care delay let's get the navigation](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m38s)

[wired up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m40s)

[for this guy and I'm I'm shamelessly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m41s)

[just looking at what we did on the other](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m45s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m46s)

[because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m47s)

[why why think harder than I then I have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m49s)

[to if you model navigate to game board](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m52s)

[and join](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m54s)

[uh index view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h43m56s)

[oh so it's just it's literally just that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m01s)

[okay I'm gonna I'm gonna just poach that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m04s)

[uh navigation](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m09s)

[there's a navigation manager cool okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m12s)

[so we don't currently have a view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m14s)

[for this guy so that's going to be a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m17s)

[little bit of a problem](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m19s)

[so let's do that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m23s)

[yeah we don't we don't even technically](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m26s)

[need to right because that's the point](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m28s)

[where you start thinking about breaking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m31s)

[that onto a component at all or like a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m33s)

[crate you know like a room component I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m35s)

[don't know yeah I'm somewhat tempted to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m37s)

[just be given how simple this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m39s)

[uh I'm kind of tempted to just go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m44s)

[right let's drop that in the code block](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m47s)

[just just straight up do this uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m49s)

[all right and so we're gonna go private](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m53s)

[something like that navigate to uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m55s)

[we're going to call this because the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h44m59s)

[next screen in flow asks the user for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m00s)

[their name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m02s)

[so navigate to Room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m04s)

[sure](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m08s)

[okay and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m10s)

[uh would there be a text box narrative](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m12s)

[for their name or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m16s)

[I don't know because they're gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m18s)

[the person creates the room gives the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m21s)

[link to the other participants the other](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m23s)

[participants click the link they need to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m25s)

[land on a page that ask them for their](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m28s)

[name and then joins them through the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m30s)

[room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m31s)

[I'm kind of thinking what we do is we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m32s)

[have a single room page and if they come](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m35s)

[in without a name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m38s)

[we set the UI prompting them for the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m40s)

[name and then once they specify a name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m42s)

[we just swap out it under the hood right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m44s)

[because then if people get smart](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m46s)

[uh because we talked about maybe like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m50s)

[even though these rooms are going to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m52s)

[kind of randomly generated IDs if people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m54s)

[wanted to keep the same link they could](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m57s)

[as long as everybody's using the same](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h45m59s)

[room ID they could all get back in like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m00s)

[if somebody wanted to put it on like an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m02s)

[Outlook invite for a reoccurring meeting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m04s)

[as long as everybody uses the same ID we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m06s)

[all join to the same place and if people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m09s)

[get really smart and they want to attack](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m11s)

[their name on the end of that query](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m12s)

[string too they can get all the way in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m14s)

[and have their name pre-filled for them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m16s)

[as well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m17s)

[that's my thought because then if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m18s)

[bookmark the page](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m20s)

[yeah it's much easier like I like when](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m21s)

[things don't require postbacks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m24s)

[for simple for simple data](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m27s)

[so that was my thought so you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m30s)

[thinking the URL has some you know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m33s)

[forward slash join forward slash with](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m35s)

[the room ID and if you hit that URL it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m38s)

[gonna it's gonna take you somewhere](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m40s)

[where you need to enter your name but if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m42s)

[there was like a almost like a query](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m45s)

[parameter on the end of that URL it we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m47s)

[pull that out and say this is your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m50s)

[username](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m51s)

[and then it takes you to the kind of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m53s)

[end page of where you're trying to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m55s)

[yeah well I'm kind of thinking that we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m57s)

[only need the two pages the landing page](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h46m59s)

[and the room page and the room page kind](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m02s)

[of has two states of when you hit it do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m04s)

[I know your name yes or no if I know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m08s)

[your name then you're allowed in and we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m10s)

[get to par and you get to participate if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m12s)

[I don't know your name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m14s)

[I prompt you for a name and then I let](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m16s)

[you in to participate gotcha it's kind](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m18s)

[of it's kind of what I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m20s)

[now we could break those into two](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m22s)

[separate pages but then you have to do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m24s)

[page postbacks and I don't know if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m26s)

[there's a big advantage to doing that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m27s)

[versus just having it all in one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m29s)

[um we need to get the navigation manager](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m33s)

[thingymabobber I want one of you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m36s)

[pretty please uh and if I recall](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m40s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m42s)

[I get that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m43s)

[um and I actually whacked in the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m45s)

[original code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m48s)

[is it here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m50s)

[one of these guys oh I may have deleted](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m52s)

[the code when I was playing with it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m54s)

[look at that uh get me on Main](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h47m57s)

[for anybody who hasn't seen it get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m01s)

[cracking 9.0 released and it's mwah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m02s)

[the new loading screen's pretty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m05s)

[pretty slick yeah he's got like dye on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m08s)

[his tentacle](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m12s)

[pretty weird I will say this ghosted](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m13s)

[Branch thing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m15s)

[I didn't think I was gonna love it as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m16s)

[much as I do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m18s)

[where you hover on a commit and it tells](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m20s)

[you what branch that commit is likely in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m22s)

[like I saw and I was like oh that looks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m24s)

[cool and then it's like oh this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m26s)

[actually like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m29s)

[useful stuff yeah you don't have to like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m30s)

[start at the bottom and work your way](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m33s)

[and follow the line to figure out what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m35s)

[what branch you're on sure](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m37s)

[okay before we do anything can we make](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m40s)

[this there's a can we fix just uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m42s)

[something in the UI here when you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m46s)

[ready I was going to go look at it what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m48s)

[do you want to fix so just remove the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m50s)

[two empty divs that you threw in there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m52s)

[surrounding it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m55s)

[and after the call md2 do space text](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h48m57s)

[Dash Center](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m02s)

[now that's just too easy though](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m05s)

[you're really ruining the the whole Joy](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m08s)

[of me sending a dip](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m11s)

[uh okay and I'm trying to remember do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m14s)

[you even need the column at that point](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m17s)

[or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m21s)

[yeah if it's just by itself I don't know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m23s)

[here I could try it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m26s)

[um and I think this gets us](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m29s)

[I think I don't know if you recall](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m37s)

[what it takes to get that navigation bit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m38s)

[in place but I think that's all it takes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m40s)

[so the navigation is it a built-in yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m44s)

[I don't know if you have to inject it is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m47s)

[that what you're talking about yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m49s)

[trying to remember the magical](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m50s)

[incantation because we did it in the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m51s)

[view model where it because it's already](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m53s)

[pre-registered for your Di](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m56s)

[so you don't have to register the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h49m59s)

[navigation manager that's already](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m01s)

[something built in but I can't remember](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m03s)

[in the code block do I do it here or is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m06s)

[there like us I can't remember if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m08s)

[there's a slash](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m10s)

[inject oh I think this is it you can do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m11s)

[it up there like that yeah check](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m15s)

[navigation manager](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m17s)

[navigation like that right and then this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m19s)

[dies](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m23s)

[and then this goes like this this goes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m25s)

[like this this goes like this and I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m26s)

[don't need this anymore](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m28s)

[and the world's a happy place](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m30s)

[all right and so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m32s)

[I'm gonna just do this really quick uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m34s)

[I kind of want to steal what's on here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m40s)

[real quick and I'm just going to rename](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m43s)

[this to room and I'm going to delete the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m44s)

[contents and we'll because I think this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m46s)

[will actually resolve the first issue](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m50s)

[and then we'll call it it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m51s)

[uh room right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m53s)

[so the navigation manager that's I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m56s)

[it's obviously something built in does](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h50m59s)

[it I guess I'm just trying to figure out](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m01s)

[what really the point of it is it is it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m03s)

[an abstraction so that you don't need to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m05s)

[yeah so you don't need to deal with any](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m09s)

[of the extras](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m11s)

[stuff around figuring out routes and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m12s)

[navigation things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m15s)

[yeah doing client-side routing and stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m16s)

[does it also handle like route guards](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m18s)

[and stuff like that route guarding](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m21s)

[foreign that's a great question](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m24s)

[I don't know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m28s)

[yeah you might have to test it out I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m30s)

[gonna say I I do not actually know the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m32s)

[answer to that question](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m35s)

[I will say I'm somewhat new to this as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m36s)

[well so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m39s)

[I don't know all the things yet](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m42s)

[I'm just kind of following her along](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m46s)

[here it's got to go through my own](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m47s)

[fingers you know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m49s)

[well there's something to be said about](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m51s)

[actually typing it yourself](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m53s)

[it forces you to think a little more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m55s)

[about it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m57s)

[okay so there's that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h51m58s)

[good](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m00s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m02s)

[hey Mine mine's centered what else you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m04s)

[got in there oh was I supposed to put](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m06s)

[inside of a fluid container in a row or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m09s)

[do I just container not fluid](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m11s)

[so drop this do I need the row two or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m14s)

[not you don't need the you don't need](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m16s)

[the column you do need the row yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m18s)

[I don't need the container fluid for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m20s)

[mobile](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m22s)

[I actually don't know what container](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m25s)

[fluid is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m27s)

[okay so we're gonna go there we're gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m29s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m31s)

[um I do want to check and see if this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m33s)

[oh I didn't bind the button anything so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m35s)

[if you don't bind the button to anything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m38s)

[it will not work](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m39s)

[in case you were wondering](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m42s)

[I know shocker plot twist yeah uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m44s)

[where's the magical button](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m49s)

[assistant on click right yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m53s)

[uh but it's you want to do this one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h52m56s)

[because yeah there's different versions](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m00s)

[yeah because you want to get the if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m01s)

[do your regular one like you would do in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m04s)

[JavaScript uh no workie well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m06s)

[it'll work but it won't it won't call](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m11s)

[this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m43s)

[I'm not getting a whole lot of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h53m44s)

[down simmer down this is not it can help](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m10s)

[you right it'd be kind of a fun exercise](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m12s)

[to like write a short story using only](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m14s)

[think that's legitimately what I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m27s)

[gonna say but but like I just you know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m29s)

[and I wonder if the issue is like you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m31s)

[saying because it's in a DOT Razer file](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m33s)

[like within the navigate to Room uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m35s)

[um but it didn't give me anything yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m50s)

[and I don't know if there's something](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m52s)

[about the integration here where it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m53s)

[loses its mind with certain files](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m55s)

[the intellisense and the code stuff](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h54m59s)

[hasn't been working very well I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m01s)

[four](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m14s)

[any objections](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m14s)

[great I wasn't even paying attention](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m17s)

[when you tested it well you know that's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m18s)

[how fast it was well here so I can I can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m21s)

[prove I will prove that it works I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m24s)

[we've got a button we click it we go to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m27s)

[the other room page the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m28s)

[oh I I should I should really put the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m33s)

[asterisk on that one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m35s)

[I wonder why that one still shows](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m39s)

[pointer star](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m40s)

[oh it's probably it oh this is yeah it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m43s)

[because it hasn't actually loaded it in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m47s)

[yet but so you create room we go to the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m49s)

[room huzzah the header's still there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m52s)

[takes us back to the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m54s)

[yay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m57s)

[so where is your gonna be where is like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h55m59s)

[so for this is a good good thing for me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m01s)

[so I have what I think is exactly what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m04s)

[you have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m07s)

[um but I'm not getting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m10s)

[not getting anything here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m13s)

[on the click](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m15s)

[so so I was just trying to debug it I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m17s)

[looking in you know I'm inspecting in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m20s)

[the browser not seeing anything there I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m21s)

[don't see anything popping up in uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m24s)

[the output within Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m27s)

[so but you have a your navigate to room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m30s)

[down here correct](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m33s)

[and this is an at on click](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m35s)

[correct and we have the inject code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m38s)

[number two yep I do okay so and it's and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m41s)

[we could I don't want to stop everybody](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m45s)

[I was just hoping this would be a good](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m47s)

[point to be like okay if I run into](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m48s)

[something like this where should I look](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m50s)

[yeah so I guess first question I would](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m51s)

[also ask is do you see the when you set](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m54s)

[a breakpoint in your method do you get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h56m58s)

[the the filled Circle or the empty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m00s)

[circle empty circle](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m03s)

[ah so it's not connecting up with your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m05s)

[browser you need to rebuild it or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m08s)

[restart the browser interesting I would](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m10s)

[tell you to rebuild that that that hot](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m13s)

[reload experience like I said it has](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m15s)

[been very hit or miss](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m17s)

[gotcha okay I was trying to use that I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m20s)

[thought that would be a really really](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m23s)

[cool it is sure it and I've gotten it to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m24s)

[work sporadically it is when it works](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m28s)

[yeah it actually works great but yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m31s)

[and that's usually how if your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m33s)

[breakpoint doesn't line up that means](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m36s)

[that the the debugger doesn't have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m37s)

[symbol information](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m39s)

[okay so we're gonna go here here here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m41s)

[let's check it real quick](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h57m43s)

[I've got a local branch made a commit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m06s)

[drag drop push and open PR](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m07s)

[mwah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m12s)

[it's pretty radical this is pound four](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m15s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m20s)

[I I do wish there was a little more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m21s)

[integration with uh GitHub such that I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m23s)

[didn't have to open the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m26s)

[the GitHub page only to enable the auto](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m28s)

[merch](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m30s)

[so I apologize here but so did you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m32s)

[create when I wasn't looking did you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m36s)

[create a room.razer page I did and I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m38s)

[I did it while you weren't looking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m43s)

[because I didn't want you to correct me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m44s)

[on anything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m45s)

[but all I did is so I I copied the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m46s)

[counter one because I'm gonna want the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m49s)

[component based stuff here in a minute](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m52s)

[but I just said it's routed slash room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m54s)

[and then I deleted all the contents and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m56s)

[just dialed it down to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h58m58s)

[something stupid](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m01s)

[I see okay right that way it's because I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m02s)

[figured this will be probably the next](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m05s)

[thing that we build out but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m07s)

[this is not got much to it I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m09s)

[hang with the experts here and I'm like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m13s)

[hold on what's going on here so that's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m15s)

[really](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m19s)

[that's really slick though](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m20s)

[um that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m23s)

[you don't you know like I've been living](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m25s)

[in you know Django land for a while and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m27s)

[to do the same thing we would need you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m30s)

[know a template which is essentially our](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m33s)

[uh razor page you would need a view you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m35s)

[would need a you know you need to set up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m40s)

[all the URL](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m42s)

[um you know routing and things like that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m44s)

[so that's like a lot of testing Jared](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=00h59m45s)

[data validation in JavaScript and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m14s)

[having to fall back and do the same](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m16s)

[writing this code twice this is so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m19s)

[annoying](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m22s)

[yeah in two different languages yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m23s)

[correct or are heading forbid like I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m25s)

[remember specifically doing a regex](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m27s)

[validation for something and discovering](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m30s)

[all the ways where regex is different in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m32s)

[JavaScript than c-sharp and I'm like I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m34s)

[hate this so much because we can do look](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m36s)

[behinds and JavaScript if I remember](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m39s)

[correctly is can't do look behind](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m41s)

[there's some the JavaScript regex](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m44s)

[implementation doesn't have one of like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m46s)

[the look aheads or look behinds I can't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m49s)

[remember which it is and it bit me so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m56s)

[okay so what's the sorry what's the uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h00m58s)

[keyboard shortcut in Visual Studio to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m03s)

[like navigate backwards and forwards](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m05s)

[uh control minus control minus control](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m08s)

[dashes yeah I will admit I tend to go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m11s)

[with control tab for just cycling](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m14s)

[between tabs because control tab does](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m17s)

[jump you to the like when you cycle](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m20s)

[through tabs it's based upon uh most](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m23s)

[recently used so it's not like control](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m25s)

[tab where it just goes to the next one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m28s)

[in a browser which does trip me up all](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m29s)

[the time is control tab will take you to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m31s)

[your previous tab that you're on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m34s)

[regardless of where it was in the list](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m35s)

[whereas in a browser it goes next tab](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m37s)

[and so I mean you could hold it down](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m41s)

[that's pretty cool yeah and and see](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m43s)

[where you're gonna go and figure out oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m45s)

[look at that see yet another bug](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m47s)

[I keep filing these bugs because I run](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m50s)

[with slightly larger font settings](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m52s)

[and the number of areas in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m55s)

[where fonts get cut off or things don't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m57s)

[size correctly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h01m59s)

[if anyone on the visual studio team is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m01s)

[okay and soapbox](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m09s)

[so and feel free to correct me but I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m16s)

[think what we want to do is if you come](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m19s)

[into the room we want the room to have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m21s)

[like optional query parameters for uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m24s)

[well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m27s)

[I guess we really can't do just straight](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m28s)

[room like this we almost need room slash](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m30s)

[that's gonna say remind me don't we yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m32s)

[or something](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m36s)

[yeah and then with an optional query](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m37s)

[parameter of like person name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m39s)

[that way that way if I bookmark it I can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m43s)

[bookmark my room with my name and always](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m47s)

[drop back in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m50s)

[yeah but when you book so here's the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m52s)

[thing though is the the creator of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m54s)

[room are we gonna let them decide the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h02m58s)

[idea of the room or are we going to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m00s)

[randomly generate an integer Forum I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m02s)

[well so I wasn't even going to do an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m04s)

[integer so I had this clever idea I've](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m05s)

[been looking for a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m09s)

[see so that that one should drop off](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m12s)

[yeah so that's merged now uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m15s)

[yeah any ID though I guess like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m21s)

[alphanumeric if even if we so are we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m23s)

[going to give them that choice or are we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m26s)

[going to generate something for them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m29s)

[because it looked like with the the old](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m30s)

[um system that we're replacing it looked](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m33s)

[like they just generated like a five](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m35s)

[digit integer for you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m36s)

[um and with that you wouldn't be able to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m38s)

[bookmark it unless you kept that room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m40s)

[open](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m42s)

[right forever so I was picturing so I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m43s)

[have been looking for an excuse to use](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m47s)

[this library for a while I it's cool and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m49s)

[pretty and I I want to find a use case](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m52s)

[for it and I'm shamelessly trying to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m54s)

[shove](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m56s)

[I have a golden Hammer and this looks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h03m57s)

[like a nail but everything may look like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m00s)

[a nail so this is the same sort of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m02s)

[generator like what YouTube does for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m04s)

[being able to generate their ID so you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m07s)

[get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m09s)

[what looks to be random](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m10s)

[but can be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m12s)

[uh persistent persistent right that way](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m15s)

[that way you can have those IDs because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m18s)

[I'm sort of picturing this working](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m21s)

[almost like your unlisted YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m22s)

[right where](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m26s)

[as long as somebody has the magical link](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m28s)

[they can get in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m30s)

[but I'm a little hesitant to let people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m31s)

[just type in their own because I can see](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m34s)

[that being a nice area for abuse](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m36s)

[and that's that's less problematic](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m41s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m44s)

[I agree](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m45s)

[and yeah like absolutely we can you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m47s)

[could have the best you could have the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m49s)

[bowl you could have Best of Both Worlds](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m51s)

[in the sense that we'll generate it for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m53s)

[you but it could be persistent right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m55s)

[well and at the end of the day so the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h04m58s)

[one of the fun things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m01s)

[it's not the right website](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m02s)

[um the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m05s)

[controller five](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m07s)

[um one of the nice things that we get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m09s)

[out of the box is signalr built in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m11s)

[so we can I I'm picturing these IDs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m15s)

[being used for groups inside of signalr](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m17s)

[as well because then whenever when you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m20s)

[join a room based on a particular ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m23s)

[you you get put in a group in signalr](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m26s)

[and that's how it controls the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m29s)

[communication between it for people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m31s)

[doing the votes and everything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m32s)

[so all of that gets wired up for you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m34s)

[which you could you could simply enable](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m36s)

[chat that way too if you wanted so that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m39s)

[people could talk back and forth or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m40s)

[whatever see I mean see Reese is already](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m42s)

[scope creeping and it's not even it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m44s)

[not even it's already adding scope](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m47s)

[but yes that but that was my thinking is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m52s)

[rather than letting them necessarily](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m55s)

[pick we could generate up an ID but then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h05m58s)

[give it a a reasonable looking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m01s)

[thing like this that way it's a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m04s)

[simpler and again we don't have to this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m08s)

[was just my initial thought of hey let's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m10s)

[go through and do something like that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m13s)

[that way we can do you know some sort of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m15s)

[random ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m17s)

[but then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m19s)

[you know and maybe set up some some](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m20s)

[given salt or whatever that we want on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m23s)

[it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m25s)

[it would be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m28s)

[I mean I think it would provide I know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m29s)

[we're not necessarily looking at](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m31s)

[security because there's no](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m33s)

[authentication anyone who has the link](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m34s)

[can join and name themselves whatever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m36s)

[they want but if we if we did generate](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m37s)

[the room IDs then we could at least have](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m39s)

[a little bit of ambiguity as to you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m41s)

[can't just punch in random things and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m44s)

[hope to get into somebody's room right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m46s)

[yeah which is why I was picturing if as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m48s)

[long as we make our our uh size fairly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m50s)

[large](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m53s)

[and the other thing we could do is we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m54s)

[could actually hide away our salt too](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m56s)

[like right now I'm thinking if we just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h06m59s)

[hard code it like it doesn't need to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m01s)

[Uber secure but this is something we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m03s)

[could bring in from like an environment](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m06s)

[variable](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m07s)

[that way if somebody wanted to try to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m08s)

[brute force and guess their way into](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m11s)

[somebody else's room it's a little bit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m13s)

[harder to do so because the sample size](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m14s)

[on this is huge](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m17s)

[plus you know it does have little things](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m20s)

[like tries to avoid basic curse words](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m22s)

[that way that way you don't randomly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m25s)

[generate and then because that's that's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m27s)

[always the scary thing when you randomly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m28s)

[generate letters it's like right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m30s)

[like one of my algorithms my simple](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m33s)

[solution was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m35s)

[you can delete like all vowels and that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m37s)

[saves you a little bit](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m39s)

[but not all the way yeah get you close](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m41s)

[yeah there's a mathematical certainty](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m43s)

[that eventually something will come up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m45s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m47s)

[correct so that that was my thought in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m48s)

[terms of generating these rooms I am](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m50s)

[wondering too if we should go through so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m53s)

[because I'm realizing that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m55s)

[there was something on this Milestone](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h07m59s)

[about giving people some ability to join](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m01s)

[as an observer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m06s)

[and now I'm wondering if maybe my](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m08s)

[comment about we just need the one room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m10s)

[page if we really do want to shove](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m11s)

[something between](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m13s)

[the actual room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m14s)

[we almost want like a Lobby page](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m17s)

[so is the idea with the Observer to not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m20s)

[even allow them to vote right or is the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m23s)

[idea that they're that the idea that go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m27s)

[ahead maybe like for uh stakeholders or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m31s)

[somebody like that yeah that's the exact](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m34s)

[case where it's where it's happened](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m36s)

[before like on one of our teams we've](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m38s)

[got uh like uh a new PM coming in who's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m40s)

[less familiar with the process and so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m44s)

[it's like hey go ahead join the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m46s)

[right don't do it because and part of it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m48s)

[is the the pointing poker site tries to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m52s)

[get everyone to vote before you show the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m54s)

[results](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m56s)

[but part of it is sometimes you want](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h08m57s)

[somebody in there who may or may not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m00s)

[want to or care to vote right somebody](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m04s)

[who's basically just there to look](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m07s)

[there I mean that could be as simple or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m11s)

[as complex as we want it though like it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m14s)

[it could be a when you join I mean](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m16s)

[there's a flag like a lurker mode you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m20s)

[know that you click and then it says](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m23s)

[accept](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m24s)

[by the way carry on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m26s)

[that's awesome](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m29s)

[so but you click that mode and then it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m31s)

[like okay it um you know we're not gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m33s)

[try to uh use you in the calculations](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m36s)

[yeah or anything yeah and that could be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m39s)

[um an even simpler way would be to just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m44s)

[say if you want to be an observer just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m46s)

[don't don't vote](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m49s)

[yeah the only thing that gets weird is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m50s)

[the controls are still there I guess](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m52s)

[yeah well and it does so there could be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m54s)

[a use case for that of just having it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h09m57s)

[not vote we would just have to deal with](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m00s)

[it when it comes for showing the votes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m01s)

[where was it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m04s)

[um oh because you would be waiting for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m06s)

[everybody's vote to tally it right right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m08s)

[and so just in turn like you when you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m09s)

[seen on like pointing poker where you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m13s)

[see the list of people and you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m15s)

[waiting to know who's voted the the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m16s)

[scrum Master is waiting to see all those](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m19s)

[votes and yeah they can keep track in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m20s)

[their head okay you know this person](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m22s)

[doesn't count but it can be a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m24s)

[Annoying it'd be nice to have those](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m25s)

[users kind of just played separately](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m28s)

[from everyone else](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m29s)

[again so if you click that button that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m31s)

[lurker mode Observer mode whatever and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m34s)

[it almost grade you out on that list](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m36s)

[of like not waiting to see a check mark](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m39s)

[next to it for the PO now something like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m42s)

[that yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m45s)

[or you have you know two tables voters](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m47s)

[observers you know and it just simply](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m51s)

[moves you from one to the other so let's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m54s)

[let's do this for the moment Let's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m56s)

[ignore](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m57s)

[well I should say do we want to put a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h10m59s)

[Lobby page in the middle real quick or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m01s)

[with the anticipation of needing it or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m03s)

[do we want to try to keep everything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m05s)

[just on the room page because it does](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m06s)

[seem like we could keep everything on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m09s)

[the room page but it's going to get a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m10s)

[little more complex for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m11s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m15s)

[dealing with those State changes right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m18s)

[because if the idea is we want to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m20s)

[able to have somebody come in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m21s)

[as an observer the other thing is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m23s)

[allowing somebody to join as a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m25s)

[facilitator because that's one of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m28s)

[other limitations is if you're the one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m30s)

[who creates the room and then you need](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m31s)

[to leave the meeting for some reason you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m34s)

[know you get a call or whatever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m36s)

[somebody else has to go and make a new](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m38s)

[room and everybody has to go and rejoin](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m39s)

[it would be much nicer to just let](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m41s)

[somebody else come in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m43s)

[and effectively set their role as a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m44s)

[facilitator](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m47s)

[past the past the room to that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m48s)

[individual yeah like it'd be nice if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m50s)

[could just take somebody in the room and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m52s)

[just Auto promote but even if it was as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m53s)

[simple as that one person has to rejoin](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m56s)

[and select their their role as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h11m58s)

[facilitator rather than team member or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m00s)

[Observer that would work right just the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m02s)

[ability to have multiple facilitators I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m05s)

[think is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m07s)

[the only real requirement](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m08s)

[so if we didn't have this Lobby page it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m10s)

[does sound like there's some stuff on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m13s)

[there at least right like facilitator](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m14s)

[mode versus Observer mode or lurker mode](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m16s)

[and all this kind of stuff yeah there's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m18s)

[a little bit of a role attached to each](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m20s)

[of these users even though](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m23s)

[um because there's no security on this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m25s)

[the role is self-enforced](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m27s)

[and it really just comes down to what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m31s)

[what do you get to see right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m34s)

[like yeah what can you do yeah it's it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m37s)

[socially enforced if I join as a as a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m39s)

[facilitator and I'm not meant to be a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m42s)

[facilitator I just get everyone on the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m44s)

[call going boo and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m46s)

[I get kicked off the team that's great](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m49s)

[so I guess yeah whoever creates the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m52s)

[is just naturally the facilitator](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m54s)

[remember yeah I mean that's the your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m55s)

[first facilitator but I but having the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h12m58s)

[ability to have somebody else come in so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m00s)

[I guess that's the question is do we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m01s)

[want to Lobby that allows the user to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m03s)

[enter name and select role](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m05s)

[and then go into the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m08s)

[I don't do it all in the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m10s)

[it almost seems like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m13s)

[the simplest thing would be you you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m15s)

[click the link it takes you to the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m18s)

[we detect that you don't have a name a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m20s)

[modal pops up and says hey welcome to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m23s)

[the room please give us a name and you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m25s)

[don't really have a choice so then you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m27s)

[pick the name right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m29s)

[um it would be I I think it would be the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m31s)

[simplest for the user to be able to if](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m32s)

[they could toggle Observer mode](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m35s)

[um do it without having to leave and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m39s)

[come back because what if for some](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m40s)

[reason you're you know rolling over two](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m42s)

[two meetings or whatever right right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m46s)

[like okay change their role mid-flight](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m48s)

[basically yeah and I think it also makes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m52s)

[sense to allow the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m55s)

[um facilitator to change people's roles](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m57s)

[from within the the room as well right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h13m59s)

[so say us three join a call Kevin you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m02s)

[started it either room so you're the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m06s)

[facilitator it'd be really nice to be](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m08s)

[able to right click uh Reese's name and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m09s)

[say you know promote to facilitator now](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m12s)

[there's U2 so you could leave and Reese](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m14s)

[would still be there right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m16s)

[um I I don't know this just just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m18s)

[spitballing I've never no so I think I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m19s)

[like it I and I believe that meets](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m22s)

[requirements](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m25s)

[yeah just throw this out there real](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m27s)

[quick when I first I heard you started](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m29s)

[to talk about that um I was I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m30s)

[imagining what you're saying is that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m33s)

[there would be like this modal right and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m34s)

[he said there would be a text box and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m36s)

[then I was also thinking you could also](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m38s)

[just have like a check boxes there ones](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m39s)

[like uh make me a facilitator or make me](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m41s)

[an observer or maybe it's a toggle](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m44s)

[button is that kind of what we were](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m46s)

[saying I'm not thinking that you should](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m47s)

[I don't think as someone joining the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m50s)

[page you should have the option to say](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m52s)

[yep I'm a facilitator I think it needs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m54s)

[to be handed to you so whoever sets up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h14m57s)

[the meeting establishes like okay well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m00s)

[these three people then you join the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m02s)

[room they can promote others and they](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m04s)

[can promote other people yes what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m07s)

[happens if the facilitator actually gets](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m08s)

[dropped out for some reason has to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m10s)

[rejoin you know like their internet](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m12s)

[connection goes down are they going to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m14s)

[be able to say oh I'm a facilitator](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m16s)

[again or what you know what would happen](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m18s)

[that's a that's a good question so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m20s)

[because if we leverage signalr for the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m23s)

[rooms we'll know about disconnects](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m25s)

[I don't know I don't know if we can](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m28s)

[handle the reconnect case given that we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m30s)

[don't have much](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m35s)

[but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m36s)

[but we'd at least know when somebody](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m37s)

[drops and if the facilitator drops we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m39s)

[could just pass the Baton for them right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m42s)

[it could just literally grab random next](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m44s)

[person in line whoever was second in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m46s)

[Europe](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m49s)

[right that would be an episode I don't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m51s)

[know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m53s)

[if anyone's ever played the computer](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m54s)

[game Squad](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m55s)

[um but you it's this Online PVP](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m57s)

[multiplayer and essentially you create a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h15m59s)

[squad and people join the squad and you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m01s)

[you know work together if you leave I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m04s)

[think it does just go down the line and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m07s)

[say well who joined right after you now](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m09s)

[he's the new squad leader like all right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m10s)

[that's just how it goes I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m12s)

[facilitator could work like that great](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m13s)

[yeah and there's a comment here about](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m15s)

[basically in the chat of when someone](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m17s)

[drops](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m20s)

[promote somebody for the facilitator the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m21s)

[idea would be nice if they reconnected](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m24s)

[repromote them back into facilitator](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m26s)

[that might get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m28s)

[I don't know because we don't have a lot](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m30s)

[of information about who the user is I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m32s)

[don't know if we can accurately](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m35s)

[detect that it's the same person coming](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m37s)

[back in right you could kind of do it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m40s)

[based on name but that feels real](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m42s)

[finicky](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m44s)

[I'd rather just let the you know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m45s)

[pass the Baton and then if they](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m48s)

[reconnect that person just has to hand](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m50s)

[the Baton back it like it doesn't seal](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m52s)

[that bad](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m53s)

[yeah yeah certainly we certainly aren't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m55s)

[working in like a I don't think or our](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h16m58s)

[use case that it's going to be like this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m02s)

[toxic environment it's gonna be people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m03s)

[working together yeah and more](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m06s)

[importantly if somebody accidentally](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m07s)

[gets in that it ends up being a toxic](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m09s)

[person like even though we aren't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m11s)

[talking about building like a kick](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m12s)

[feature or anything you just gen a new](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m14s)

[room right as long as we make sure that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m16s)

[these room IDs are difficult to get by](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m17s)

[like they would have to it it's kind of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m19s)

[like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m21s)

[if anybody grew up with those little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m22s)

[two-way radios right if somebody else](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m24s)

[has a lot of frequencies on there yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m26s)

[if somebody happened to uh get on your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m28s)

[frequency you just tell everybody okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m30s)

[switch to this one everybody jumps and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m32s)

[now the person's gone right we're just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m34s)

[doing that in a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m36s)

[a more modern sense](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m37s)

[yeah yeah it would be fun to have like a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m40s)

[kick feature though where any any person](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m42s)

[could kick any other person out just now](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m44s)

[that is definitely right for abuse](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m47s)

[unless you know and then we'd leave them](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m49s)

[in even though we're even though we're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m52s)

[not doing like uh you know we're not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m54s)

[using any kind of authentication here I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m56s)

[don't think it'd be incredibly hard to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h17m58s)

[store some metadata when someone creates](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m01s)

[a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m05s)

[creates a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m06s)

[room that so say when the user clicks](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m08s)

[create room you add your name in there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m12s)

[maybe it generates a hash for you that's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m15s)

[not just the room ID something like a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m19s)

[copy and paste and if you get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m21s)

[disconnected](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m23s)

[you can join back in with this hash and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m24s)

[we remember you as the original](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m26s)

[facilitator yeah the comment here is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m28s)

[slap a grid in a cookie or something to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m30s)

[be able to re-identify them yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m32s)

[something like that or is definitely](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m33s)

[doable](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m35s)

[right or give the facilitator two URLs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m37s)

[to share one as an invite to everybody](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m41s)

[else and one for yourself in case you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m43s)

[get dropped and that somehow I don't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m45s)

[know removes all other facilitators or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m48s)

[whatever and makes you yeah I think it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m50s)

[going too far in the weeds but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m53s)

[anyways okay so that's cool yeah so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m56s)

[let's let's run down this path then so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h18m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m01s)

[let's assume for the moment that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m02s)

[we're going to generate a room ID let's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m06s)

[let's make it simple for the moment](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m09s)

[I heard all room IDs are one two three](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m12s)

[just for the the case of Simplicity for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m16s)

[the moment](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m18s)

[that way we can have this much set up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m20s)

[and then let's let's hack on this room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m23s)

[thing a little bit because I think this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m25s)

[is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m26s)

[I'm gonna put I'll actually put to do in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m27s)

[front of here right because this is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m29s)

[actually something else for somebody](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m30s)

[else to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m31s)

[um generate up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m33s)

[no one said I couldn't use the picture](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m39s)

[as a class sorry I'm I'm getting made](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m40s)

[fun of for my Mountain Dew cup](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m43s)

[this is only drink like half of that cup](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m47s)

[too](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m49s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m51s)

[like I said I only brought one was that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m51s)

[from the Christmas party yes I say it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m53s)

[a random access memory for those people](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m56s)

[who can't read](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m57s)

[I've only I've only had one cup of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h19m59s)

[Mountain Dew tonight](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m02s)

[one that thing's gotta hold like 48](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m04s)

[ounces easy uh it holds about 90 of a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m07s)

[two liter don't ask me how I know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m10s)

[you have to defrag the memory to get the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m13s)

[rest of the two liter in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m15s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m18s)

[or use the what or use one of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m19s)

[smaller sharing utensils that came with](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m21s)

[the pitcher](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m23s)

[uh okay copilot this is not your time to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m25s)

[shine](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m28s)

[I was gonna say it's working out I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m30s)

[like thank you co-pilot no that's not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m32s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m34s)

[um okay so we need to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m35s)

[we need to grab the the query parameter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m37s)

[here for the room ID I think yes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m40s)

[I think is where we're going and I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m44s)

[trying to remember](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m45s)

[I don't know if you saw in the our](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m49s)

[team's chat I sent a link uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m51s)

[um if that was your what you're looking](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m53s)

[for probably](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m55s)

[yes uh uh okay and we just want](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h20m59s)

[I don't want good uh I guess I can just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m06s)

[leave the type off though and it becomes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m09s)

[string doesn't it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m11s)

[yeah I think that's the default](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m12s)

[I think that if I remember correctly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m15s)

[that's what I saw before so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m16s)

[do this as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m18s)

[room ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m21s)

[and we'll do here and then if I recall](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m23s)

[correctly I could do something like code](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m26s)

[I saw a little bit of copilot trying to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m30s)

[be helpful there for a minute you want](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m32s)

[to go copilot no don't write the code up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m33s)

[there's the co-pilot we know and love](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m37s)

[I'm not even getting close](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m41s)

[how'd you get it there you talked nicely](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m44s)

[to it I say nice things about it and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m46s)

[it's just something new too](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m50s)

[uh okay hold on it it's actually it's I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m52s)

[think it's you know I think what it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m55s)

[doing is analyzing your code right now](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m56s)

[and being like talking to my code now I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h21m58s)

[guess I think these guys are working](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m00s)

[together all right so just put in here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m01s)

[whatever I'm not putting it past](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m02s)

[co-pilot to like listen it on my mic](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m04s)

[yeah okay hold on it's it's catching up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m10s)

[now it's getting slow it yeah it takes a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m12s)

[little while though to read yours](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m14s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m16s)

[okay all right I'm with you that took](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m19s)

[way too long we're so your room ID so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m20s)

[are you already working](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m23s)

[oh interesting so you're already](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m25s)

[inheriting okay I'm catching up I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m27s)

[catching it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m29s)

[yeah so this guy here this guy here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m30s)

[um it overrides on initialized it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m34s)

[figured out that I have a view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m37s)

[with a room ID now here's the question](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m39s)

[my it doesn't co-pilot make room ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m41s)

[property](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m45s)

[that would creep me out yeah I'd just go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m48s)

[to bed](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m49s)

[it's been awesome I mean I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m51s)

[I I cannot eliminate it doing that okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m54s)

[I don't know that we need this but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h22m59s)

[co-pilot's telling me to do it so I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m00s)

[I'm gonna do it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m02s)

[there okay so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m05s)

[on initialize we get the room ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m07s)

[let's just confirm that this much](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m10s)

[actually works I think it I think it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m12s)

[does but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m13s)

[we'll just make absolutely certain](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m14s)

[and like uh Jared I know that you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m22s)

[probably on the earlier cap for time](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m25s)

[but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m28s)

[when it gets late feel free to drop I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m29s)

[obviously have way too much caffeine in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m32s)

[my system](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m34s)

[I'm also off tomorrow so I have a double](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m35s)

[Advantage](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m38s)

[we're gonna work tomorrow yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m40s)

[interesting so so there's what okay so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m48s)

[that that auto failed](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m52s)

[what what went wrong open Dev tools sure](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m56s)

[show me is there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h23m58s)

[uh console](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m04s)

[cannot provide a valuable property view](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m08s)

[model on the oh there is no register so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m11s)

[this is a good example here I don't know](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m14s)

[if you can read that Derek Jared did you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m15s)

[did you see what uh yeah did you see](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m17s)

[what what you see the chat uh but uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m20s)

[what bam just put in there yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m23s)

[we're using the wrong comments obviously](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m27s)

[clearly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m29s)

[for the room page with roommate](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m36s)

[well so I think this is uh that's chat](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m38s)

[GPT doing it not uh co-pilot clearly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m41s)

[like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m45s)

[yeah uh but this comment here on the of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m47s)

[why this thing's failing so this is what](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m51s)

[you this is the air that you'll end up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m53s)

[seeing when you forget to do your di](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m55s)

[registration so great for example I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m57s)

[created a room view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h24m59s)

[um but I have not registered it with my](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m02s)

[Di and so because my room raiser says](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m05s)

[Hey create me a room view model it goes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m08s)

[I don't know what you're talking about](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m12s)

[so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m13s)

[just register it and then our world will](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m16s)

[become happier](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m19s)

[so and it's worth noting these di](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m22s)

[registrations](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m24s)

[live inside of the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m26s)

[the client's browser so the idea of like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m29s)

[scoped in Singleton is a little weird](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m32s)

[because it's Singleton instance per](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m35s)

[client](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m38s)

[so that it it gets you have to think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m40s)

[about the the DI rules a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m44s)

[differently](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m48s)

[when you're running inside the client](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m49s)

[project versus the server](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m50s)

[because this runs on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m52s)

[individual ones okay room ID populated](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m55s)

[one two three](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m58s)

[great okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h25m59s)

[okay so we got a room ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m01s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m04s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m05s)

[and then I think uh where do you want to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m07s)

[go next](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m09s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m11s)

[thing we can do and then I think I might](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m15s)

[drop off](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m17s)

[well I was so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m18s)

[I was gonna say we could look at either](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m20s)

[like prompting for a name we could do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m23s)

[like the query parameter because I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m24s)

[that's just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m26s)

[like this oh yeah instead to whatever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m28s)

[yeah I think that's how this works](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m35s)

[right and I'm gonna turn on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m38s)

[oh yeah oh I guess this one really has](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m42s)

[to be set in order for the route to make](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m44s)

[it in you can't yeah but this one](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m46s)

[certainly could](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m48s)

[right yes that one could be optional](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m49s)

[let's let's confirm that that this works](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m51s)

[but I don't see why it wouldn't](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m54s)

[do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h26m58s)

[because I think that way we've got this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m00s)

[and then it'll be a matter of doing it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m02s)

[um just for your guys's own thing if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m05s)

[want to help on this jump in whenever](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m07s)

[you want right and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m10s)

[like I said wait what are you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m13s)

[unhandled exception occurred](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m16s)

[how is there an unhandled exception we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m18s)

[were on the home page](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m19s)

[we crashing on here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m28s)

[oh the character and parameter segment](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m30s)

[is not allowed oh so I've done something](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m32s)

[wrong here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m36s)

[I'll have to look up query parameters I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m38s)

[wonder if you just oh I bet you just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m40s)

[leave it off](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m41s)

[I bet you that's what it is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m43s)

[trying to remember because we did this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m45s)

[before where oh yeah I think this will](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m46s)

[do the same type of like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m50s)

[um model binding asp.net core does](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m52s)

[or if it sees it it'll use it if it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m55s)

[doesn't it's happy about it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h27m59s)

[so if I do four five six](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m01s)

[name gets Jared](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m04s)

[because I am going to definitely](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m08s)

[masquerade as Jared](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m10s)

[I wouldn't do that if I were you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m13s)

[so when you were registering](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m17s)

[the room view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m20s)

[it's Builder services](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m23s)

[at scoped was there already something in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m27s)

[there I don't see anything else in there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m29s)

[that's ads oh yeah it's got it in there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m30s)

[and scoped is actually](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m34s)

[scoped is probably not overly](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m36s)

[useful](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m40s)

[um interesting](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m43s)

[yeah it so because again the scope in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m45s)

[this case is going to be around that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m48s)

[browser session not around anything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m50s)

[related to other users](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m53s)

[well our um our program.cs looks quite a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m55s)

[bit different from each other uh are you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h28m59s)

[looking at the program CS in the client](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m01s)

[project or the server project](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m03s)

[because there's two program CSS](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m07s)

[okay does yours look more like this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m10s)

[let me go let me get over there like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m14s)

[this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m17s)

[um I was definitely looking at the wrong](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m19s)

[one yeah yep okay I found it yeah so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m21s)

[that that'll be the the key difference](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m24s)

[there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m26s)

[uh and Reese is once again on point I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m27s)

[guessing he's already solved my problem](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m30s)

[uh Supply parameter from query attribute](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m33s)

[oh look at that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m36s)

[that's what I want](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m39s)

[component parameter name query parameter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m42s)

[name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m45s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m48s)

[uh so if we go here and here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m49s)

[we want to do here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m54s)

[all right we want this to be name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h29m57s)

[and we do that button and then we do](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m01s)

[that button and then it all works just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m04s)

[fine and everyone's happy I suppose I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m06s)

[could set my launch settings.json to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m07s)

[just take me there that's the other](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m09s)

[advantage of taking things on the query](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m11s)

[string is you can make your debugging](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m12s)

[life easier](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m15s)

[oh interesting yeah that's an](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m17s)

[interesting point you could probably add](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m19s)

[that and then remove it later too if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m20s)

[wanted I guess right if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m23s)

[use it just for debugging maybe](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m25s)

[that is absolutely correct the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m27s)

[um you do need to set](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m31s)

[not the launch settings in client though](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m33s)

[you want to set them down because you'll](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m36s)

[note that the project I'm actually](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m37s)

[launching is server not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m39s)

[not client so it does get a little](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m42s)

[different](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m46s)

[it doesn't look like they there's a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m48s)

[launch URL](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m50s)

[but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m52s)

[for now I'm just going to type it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m53s)

[because four five six](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m55s)

[name gets Reese this time because I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h30m58s)

[going to masquerade as somebody else](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m00s)

[again](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m02s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m06s)

[sorry there's nothing at this address oh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m09s)

[because I didn't type](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m11s)

[room slash](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m13s)

[so it doesn't know where to go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m16s)

[let's try this again](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m18s)

[and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m23s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m28s)

[I am Reese](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m29s)

[that was a very lackluster yeah yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m37s)

[getting tired](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m42s)

[Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m44s)

[yeah I was to say I I would hand you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m46s)

[some it doesn't go through the internet](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m49s)

[well](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m50s)

[hi if you need one there's one under my](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m54s)

[desk Greece you can steal it tomorrow](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h31m57s)

[I might just do that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m01s)

[as long as long as you like the uh the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m03s)

[voltage I believe there's like two or](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m05s)

[three cans of voltage under my desk so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m07s)

[help yourself](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m09s)

[so now from the from the room view model](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m11s)

[this is this is interesting so like so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m15s)

[you're supplying the name in the uh as a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m18s)

[parameter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m21s)

[and if you maybe you're maybe you're](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m24s)

[already doing this in the room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m26s)

[view model could I reference that name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m29s)

[not without adding it so typically you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m32s)

[would end up doing something like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m34s)

[oh gotcha](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m37s)

[right and and forward it in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m40s)

[which is probably something so you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m43s)

[weren't necessarily doing anything with](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m46s)

[it yeah no no nothing magical yet](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m48s)

[but](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m51s)

[you could point it straight at the view](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m53s)

[model too in the property I think uh and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m55s)

[there is a warning though about doing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h32m58s)

[that so there's yeah there's a specific](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m00s)

[analyzer that they actually enabled in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m04s)

[net 7. that cautions against](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m06s)

[parameter properties being anything](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m10s)

[other than Auto props](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m12s)

[because if you have any oh yeah because](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m14s)

[if you're having side effects](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m17s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m19s)

[I'm trying to remember because I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m21s)

[reading the GitHub issue on it where](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m23s)

[they were discussing building this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m25s)

[analyzer so if you do make a parameter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m26s)

[they really encourage Auto props and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m29s)

[then forward on elsewhere that you need](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m33s)

[uh uh in order to use it yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m35s)

[so okay so that gets us there that gets](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m40s)

[us there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m44s)

[Reese if you need to draw](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m45s)

[so if you I guess you're saying if you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m47s)

[did cut it that way we should get it you](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m50s)

[should get a warning I'm assuming that's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m52s)

[yeah and do something like uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m53s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h33m58s)

[uh parameter](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m01s)

[public spring](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m04s)

[and if I do something like this and go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m06s)

[get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m09s)

[uh viewmodel.name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m10s)

[right set](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m13s)

[you model Dot](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m16s)

[name gets value](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m19s)

[right look forward to there I believe](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m22s)

[this was the case that I saw that runs](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m24s)

[in that runs a muck of it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m27s)

[and I think it only elevates as a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m31s)

[warning](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m33s)

[uh yeah this one here](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m35s)

[this bl07 yeah there it is an opponent](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m38s)

[parameter should be an auto property so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m41s)

[this is where I was like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m44s)

[does it work yes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m47s)

[but they but they have a long time on it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m49s)

[on GitHub about the rationale behind it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m52s)

[I think I've seen some of the in our](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m56s)

[clock possibly it is and I if I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h34m59s)

[understood the thread correctly I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m01s)

[it's okay to do as long as there's no](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m03s)

[side effects](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m06s)

[and so you can get so it's one of those](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m08s)

[things where you can kind of get away](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m10s)

[with it](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m12s)

[until you can't and then things get](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m13s)

[weird and broken and you don't know why](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m16s)

[and so it's like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m17s)

[so the recommendations](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m21s)

[what's what is um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m23s)

[pragmatic programmer talks about that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m26s)

[like don't code by coincidence yes like](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m28s)

[it's just a coincidence that this works](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m32s)

[we're not really doing it right right](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m33s)

[yeah right right um can you show me your](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m36s)

[uh your browser again real quick Kevin](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m40s)

[I'm about to get out of here too but I](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m42s)

[just wanted to like when I finally um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m45s)

[uh no yeah sorry with the name uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m47s)

[parameter in there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m50s)

[and how did you know were you just](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m52s)

[seeing did you have a break point set in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m54s)

[there how did you know it was working so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m56s)

[other than it just wasn't complaining so](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m57s)

[I I did set a break point](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h35m59s)

[um and then once it fired up](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m02s)

[let it load](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m05s)

[um so I just went slash room slash room](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m07s)

[ID which is going to be 678 nope it's](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m10s)

[going to be 42 because that's the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m12s)

[appropriate answer and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m14s)

[I a question mark question mark name to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m17s)

[add it on a query string so on the on](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m20s)

[the Uris](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m24s)

[at the end of the route the question](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m25s)

[mark separates the query string](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m27s)

[parameters from the the rest of the URI](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m30s)

[and then these just become name value](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m33s)

[pairs that are then separated by uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m36s)

[ampersands at each step of the way yeah](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m39s)

[so I just had the syntax wrong I was](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m40s)

[using trying to use an ampersand to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m43s)

[start and it was being mixed in with my](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m45s)

[room name my room ID ah yes so yes yes](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m47s)

[yes and because that thing is just a](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m51s)

[string it goes okay sure I can fit that](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m53s)

[in a string whereas other types](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h36m56s)

[a little more restrictive right and then](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m00s)

[I come in here and I can go my room ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m03s)

[is 42. my name is Kevin at least for](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m05s)

[today it is](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m08s)

[and then away we go](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m09s)

[I like it so what what stories did we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m12s)

[close out here then so we closed out at](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m14s)

[least the first one I'm gonna check this](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m16s)

[stuff in](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m18s)

[as](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m19s)

[uh let's see uh there's adding landing](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m20s)

[page reset there](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m24s)

[and then let's see create branch](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m27s)

[uh pass room ID](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m31s)

[sure we'll do that call it that pop and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m34s)

[uh I've seen in room ID and name](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m40s)

[it and then once again we do the](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m46s)

[wonderful get Kraken submit and I think](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m49s)

[this is going to end up just being](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m53s)

[issues this is going to be ultimately](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h37m58s)

[related to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m03s)

[kind of five but we are we kind of asked](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m04s)

[how this is going to work](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m09s)

[so after discussion](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m10s)

[we might handle these elements](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m14s)

[so it's kind of related to five kind of](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m19s)

[not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m22s)

[but five is kind of dying so maybe we](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m23s)

[don't care](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m26s)

[uh relates to](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m31s)

[down five so create pull request and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m35s)

[then open on GitHub and](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m38s)

[enable auto merge enable auto merge](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m42s)

[as you can see I did not](https://youtu.be/RhPE8Seb--E?t=01h38m45s)
