[okay everyone welcome](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m02s)

[uh tonight we're gonna do something a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m04s)

[little bit different i i plan on still](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m05s)

[focusing on the material design](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m07s)

[uh in xaml project um but i was offered](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m12s)

[an opportunity to go through and uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m13s)

[basically give](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m15s)

[a piece of software called end depend uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m16s)

[a test drive](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m19s)

[so my plan is to point this at the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m20s)

[material design project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m23s)

[and kind of put it through its paces and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m24s)

[see what it can do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m26s)

[my plan is to kind of uh as we go along](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m28s)

[fill out any feedback i have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m30s)

[um the the develop manager that sent me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m32s)

[the the license](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m35s)

[uh asked for any information or feedback](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m37s)

[i had for it so i figured i'd just jot](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m39s)

[that down in addition to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m40s)

[this video obviously and then go from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m42s)

[there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m45s)

[um but first before i get too carried](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m45s)

[away](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m48s)

[there was a net conference](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m50s)

[this morning and as soon as i get my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m53s)

[buttons going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m56s)

[ah there we are boom so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h00m57s)

[there was specifically a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m00s)

[uh net conference today focused entirely](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m04s)

[on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m06s)

[desktop development oh that is loud um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m07s)

[mute there we go um so if](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m12s)

[you are interested in catching up on all](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m15s)

[of the cool stuff it was basically](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m17s)

[focused all around](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m18s)

[uh desktop development so it wasn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m20s)

[exclusively uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m22s)

[wpf type related stuff there was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m23s)

[winforms thrown in there wpf](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m25s)

[uh winrt a little bit of maui for people](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m28s)

[who want to do xamarin forms or mobile](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m30s)

[but it was basically largely around what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m32s)

[you can do with thick client stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m35s)

[and the the really interesting part for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m37s)

[me is that the line of what counts as a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m39s)

[thick client](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m41s)

[is starting to get really blurry um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m43s)

[you'll note in some of the stuff that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m45s)

[they show off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m47s)

[there is a a bunch of stuff related to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m48s)

[what they're doing with blazer and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m52s)

[electron apps and again kind of blurring](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m53s)

[that line between what i can do with web](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m56s)

[and what i can do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m58s)

[um with a uh like a full wpf of winforms](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h01m59s)

[app](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m03s)

[uh at the end of the day it really boils](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m04s)

[down to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m06s)

[what functionality do you need and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m07s)

[probably more importantly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m09s)

[what is your expertise so if i've got a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m11s)

[team full of web developers i probably](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m14s)

[don't recommend throwing them in a wpf](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m16s)

[app unless there's some bit of that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m18s)

[framework that you actually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m20s)

[need to leverage right but if i've got a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m22s)

[bunch of people who are already very](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m25s)

[familiar with xaml well that might be an](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m26s)

[opportunity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m28s)

[to look at it or maybe consider](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m28s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m30s)

[win ui which is not ga yet but they're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m31s)

[getting close](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m34s)

[um i think i saw preview six](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m36s)

[drop maybe i might be getting it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m39s)

[confused with something else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m41s)

[there's when ui previews out they're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m42s)

[cool so check them out when ui is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m44s)

[basically the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m46s)

[the next evolution for uwp applications](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m47s)

[so with that so if anybody is interested](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m50s)

[and actually i'll drop the entire.net](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m54s)

[channel so if you are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m55s)

[i'm not even subscribed to this let's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m58s)

[fix that button so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h02m59s)

[if you have not subscribed to the.net](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m01s)

[channel you should do so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m03s)

[lots of great content there and then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m05s)

[more importantly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m07s)

[uh my youtube channel because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m10s)

[you're here watching this so um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m14s)

[okay so uh all of that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m17s)

[uh i don't trying to think if i remember](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m20s)

[seeing there was lots of great](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m23s)

[information in all of the talks](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m24s)

[um i'm trying to think of what was if](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m26s)

[there was anything](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m29s)

[new or revolutionary that was coming](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m30s)

[there was a lot of great stuff showing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m32s)

[off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m34s)

[a lot of the capabilities that's in the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m35s)

[latest visual studio designer](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m36s)

[so if you aren't running the latest](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m39s)

[visual studio i definitely recommend](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m40s)

[updating it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m42s)

[you'll see me when i'm running it i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m44s)

[typically on preview builds](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m46s)

[so it gets a little more here i'll move](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m48s)

[that so it's visible](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m51s)

[preview so i'm usually downloading the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m53s)

[latest and greatest visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m55s)

[preview](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m57s)

[bear in mind i have more than one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h03m58s)

[computer so even though i will use this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m00s)

[uh for my day-to-day work um i do have a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m03s)

[fallback machine that doesn't have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m06s)

[previews on it so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m07s)

[in the event something catastrophic goes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m09s)

[wrong i can fall back to my other](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m10s)

[machine](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m12s)

[but i haven't had to fall back to my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m13s)

[other machine for months so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m14s)

[in general the previews are really](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m16s)

[really stable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m18s)

[um at least stable enough for me to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m20s)

[my day job](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m22s)

[and not feel like there's any loss of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m23s)

[productivity and i get all the latest](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m25s)

[features so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m27s)

[for what it's worth i really like them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m28s)

[and they're awesome](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m30s)

[okay so switching gears a little bit so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m32s)

[end depend](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m34s)

[so let's let me pull this up here so if](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m36s)

[people are interested so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m39s)

[this is this is the bit of software that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m40s)

[i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m43s)

[that i got that i got access to here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m44s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m46s)

[this is a um it so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m48s)

[i'm gonna try to describe this as best i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m51s)

[can so i've only been playing with it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m52s)

[for about a week](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m54s)

[so there is probably a lot of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m55s)

[opportunities for me to have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m57s)

[done something wrong and maybe that just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h04m59s)

[indicates usability problems if i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m01s)

[struggling with it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m03s)

[um but there's multiple ways you can run](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m04s)

[this you can run this as a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m07s)

[visual studio plug-in which is i i think](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m10s)

[my i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m12s)

[messed around with a couple options and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m13s)

[i think the visual studio plug-ins the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m14s)

[way i like best](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m16s)

[but there is also just a standalone xc](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m17s)

[if you want to go that route](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m19s)

[which is great that's kind of cool um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m20s)

[and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m23s)

[uh it'll go through and pick it up now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m24s)

[let me let me actually go through and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m27s)

[and fire this up so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m29s)

[i'm gonna just declare tab bankruptcy](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m30s)

[real quick close all tabs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m33s)

[so this is the material design in xaml](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m35s)

[project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m37s)

[so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m38s)

[if anybody's interested there's the link](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m41s)

[and if we go up so i've already gone](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m47s)

[through the installation process](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m49s)

[i don't feel like that's overly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m51s)

[interesting to show people because it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m52s)

[it's really just a matter of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m54s)

[click the installer type in your license](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h05m58s)

[key away you go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m00s)

[um there is the github link to the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m30s)

[project as well so that one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m32s)

[should work because i just took it off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m34s)

[github](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m36s)

[um okay so apparently i hadn't already](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m38s)

[set up a project with this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m42s)

[no problem um so let's go through and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h06m44s)

[yeah so uh we'll just add visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m38s)

[project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m42s)

[and i want oh it remembers every project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m42s)

[i've pointed this at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m45s)

[that's a little creepy that's exciting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m46s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m49s)

[so we'll point it at the main toolkit](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m50s)

[solution it finds all my stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m51s)

[that's pretty cool finds all my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m54s)

[reference stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m56s)

[uh yeah that sounds good](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h07m58s)

[and you can go through and you can do a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m01s)

[bunch of stuff here so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m03s)

[the one thing that i highly recommend](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m05s)

[doing so if you're already running](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m06s)

[code coverage so if you're on any](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m09s)

[decently new.net one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m12s)

[or if you've just done test analyze code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m14s)

[coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m17s)

[right this setting here i wish it would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m18s)

[pick it up by default](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m20s)

[um because i always have to browse out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m22s)

[to it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m24s)

[let's see let's just go material design](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m25s)

[test results and somewhere in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m28s)

[actually i think i can just point at the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m31s)

[root directory of test results](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m32s)

[does it find it from there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m34s)

[that no that picked up the top one i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m38s)

[don't want you to pick up the top one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m40s)

[just root directory](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m42s)

[there huh huh will you will you do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m45s)

[recursive](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m47s)

[boo oh now i gotta go figure out which](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m49s)

[one of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m52s)

[ugly good things is the real one nope](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m54s)

[nope one of them has it really](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h08m59s)

[okay new plan uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m04s)

[oh come on okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m08s)

[back up delete there we go that will](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m12s)

[just kill it so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m15s)

[real quick before we do this i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m16s)

[hit analyze code coverage from all tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m17s)

[so this is something um i believe that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m20s)

[button only exists in visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m24s)

[enterprise i could be wrong i'm trying](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m26s)

[to remember exactly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m29s)

[i something back my mind is telling me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m30s)

[that the code coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m32s)

[tool is only in the the upper skus of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m34s)

[visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m36s)

[however if you are on um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m37s)

[if you are on net core and to some](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m42s)

[extent net framework](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m44s)

[what you can use instead](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m45s)

[let me just grab uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m48s)

[oh i can probably just do this cover](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m52s)

[let uh nope not in this repository let's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m56s)

[just do here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h09m59s)

[uh if you this guy so this one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m02s)

[actually shows up in uh if you do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m05s)

[net new on any uh newer project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m09s)

[you'll note that you get a a link to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m12s)

[coverlet so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m14s)

[this is only guaranteed to work in net](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m16s)

[core however i have been using it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m19s)

[successfully in.net framework](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m22s)

[for a while and for the most part they](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m24s)

[say yeah this just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m26s)

[works so standby it's going to run my ui](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m27s)

[test so this it's just going to flash a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m31s)

[bunch of windows at us](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m32s)

[i forgot that when you hit analyze from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m34s)

[all tests it runs all tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m35s)

[so there's that but you can use coverlet](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m37s)

[to go through and get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m41s)

[code coverage the same way that you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m43s)

[could inside of the visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m45s)

[tool so if you don't have the latest](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m47s)

[visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m49s)

[rest assured you're not out of out of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m50s)

[luck you just got to add a new get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m53s)

[package](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m54s)

[and you only add this nuget package to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m55s)

[your unit test project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m57s)

[and then from the command line you can](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h10m59s)

[do net test](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m01s)

[dash dash collect cross plat code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m02s)

[coverage like it shows there at the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m04s)

[bottom](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m05s)

[and you're off to the races and that'll](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m06s)

[start generating out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m08s)

[the cool code coverage files that you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m10s)

[can then feed into to various things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m12s)

[so if people are interested that might](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m14s)

[be a fun thing to show at some point](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m16s)

[i recently have gone through a bunch of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m18s)

[projects and set up code coverage on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m20s)

[them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m22s)

[so i feel like i've run into every](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m23s)

[possible mistake you can make along the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m25s)

[way it's very exciting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m27s)

[highly frustrating and very exciting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m29s)

[but there is nothing better than getting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m32s)

[a really pretty looking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m34s)

[graph rendered to you in html showing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m37s)

[you where all your code coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m40s)

[is and where it isn't because the isn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m42s)

[is the interesting case](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m47s)

[everyone's happy and we'll let this guy](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m51s)

[run](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m53s)

[and then we will run independ and i've](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m54s)

[i've run this previously already on this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m56s)

[project which is why i was surprised i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h11m58s)

[didn't have an existing project to start](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m00s)

[from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m01s)

[so the one cool thing that endepen does](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m02s)

[is it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m04s)

[um it's sort of set up for the idea of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m05s)

[to come into an existing code base](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m08s)

[rather than to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m10s)

[always be something that you plug in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m12s)

[from the beginning so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m13s)

[when you run it it generates what's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m15s)

[called a baseline and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m16s)

[its goal is to keep you from adding bad](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m18s)

[code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m21s)

[so obviously with every coding guideline](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m22s)

[there is going to be exceptions right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m25s)

[at times it is necessary to violate a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m27s)

[guideline because to follow it would be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m29s)

[say more costly than than fixing it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m32s)

[right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m34s)

[um there's there's also the concept of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m35s)

[usually when you have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m39s)

[flaws it's probably worth fixing them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m40s)

[because at a minimum it's probably](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m43s)

[going to add confusion or potential](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m45s)

[problems down the road right and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m47s)

[sometimes you look at it and go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m48s)

[yeah it's not a problem i actually care](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m50s)

[about or like in our case](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m51s)

[yeah that's in the demo project i don't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m53s)

[really care right that's not part of the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m55s)

[nuget package we're not shipping that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m56s)

[code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h12m58s)

[how how impactful is it really right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m00s)

[there is a judgment call to be made](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m03s)

[but what it does is it keeps that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m04s)

[baseline and then every time you run it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m06s)

[it'll compare uh the the run to your](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m09s)

[baseline and it can give you that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m12s)

[that delta and then let you focus in on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m14s)

[just the changes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m17s)

[or i should say the the problems that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m18s)

[have been introduced](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m20s)

[since the baseline and that i can really](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m21s)

[appreciate because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m23s)

[it's always frustrating when you have a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m24s)

[tool that's like yeah just plug us in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m26s)

[from the beginning and it'll be great](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m28s)

[it's like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m29s)

[yeah you realize i started my project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m30s)

[nine months ago it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m31s)

[kind of like i don't want to spend time](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m33s)

[going through and doing it and fixing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m34s)

[everything and this one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m36s)

[really is set up from the beginning to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m37s)

[say uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m39s)

[let's rather than going through and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m42s)

[doing uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m43s)

[that let's actually figure it out so i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m45s)

[guessing it hasn't finished running yet](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m47s)

[test explorer let's look yeah it's still](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m50s)

[running some tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m52s)

[and yeah there's a couple failures](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m54s)

[that's okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m56s)

[at some point i need to actually go and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m58s)

[fix these failures](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h13m59s)

[they annoy me but they are culture based](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m02s)

[and they apparently only reproduce on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m06s)

[my english culture because they pass on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m10s)

[the pipeline](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m12s)

[which is exciting usually things go the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m13s)

[other way okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m15s)

[all that work just so we can have this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m17s)

[lovely little dot coverage file](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m19s)

[okay so now what we want to do is we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m21s)

[want to go and add that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m23s)

[so grab me my code coverage browse](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m24s)

[uh oh come on put all of them back](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m28s)

[one of you has code coverage come on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m34s)

[where](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m37s)

[where is the doc coverage file](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m37s)

[where why am i an idiot it shows me the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m40s)

[code coverage file i know that you exist](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m45s)

[code coverage where are you uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m48s)

[let's just do this let me move this to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m55s)

[the side for a moment](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m56s)

[because i don't know what it's going to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m58s)

[find and we're going to just keep that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h14m59s)

[hidden until i know what i'm looking at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m01s)

[so date modified at the top](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m03s)

[yeah so it shows that it should be in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m09s)

[so code coverage browse](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m14s)

[browse i'm looking for three three](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m17s)

[oh yeah it's right there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m20s)

[okay so found my code coverage great](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m23s)

[okay so we get that going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m26s)

[you can go through and you can configure](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m28s)

[all kinds of stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m30s)

[so the other cool thing is um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m31s)

[this thing actually tries to put a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m35s)

[number on your tech debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m37s)

[right and that's that's always a hard](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m38s)

[thing uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m40s)

[to argue like i find that that's a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m41s)

[usually a difficult thing to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m44s)

[convince the um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m45s)

[the the project owner of hey no we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m49s)

[really need to fix this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m51s)

[debt debt because this actually not only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m52s)

[does it calculate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m55s)

[how much time it thinks it's going to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m56s)

[take to fix but it calculates the cost](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h15m58s)

[of not fixing it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m00s)

[but we want it now exactly and that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m03s)

[think is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m06s)

[uh let's see mandates and money i like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m08s)

[that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m11s)

[and i want in the u.s we put our dollar](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m12s)

[sign at the beginning](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m15s)

[uh because that's how we do it uh work](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m17s)

[hours per day let's turn that down](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m21s)

[because nobody actually does](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m22s)

[the full thing uh 20](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m24s)

[week yeah sure close enough this isn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m27s)

[real so we're gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m30s)

[uh so you can customize all that out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m32s)

[i'm going to just take the defaults](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m36s)

[because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m38s)

[yeah sure we're going to go with that so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m42s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m44s)

[save and then run analysis and build](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m45s)

[report](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m47s)

[and this is where the coolness happens](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m48s)

[as i will say i have been i was a little](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m52s)

[skeptical because you see these types of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m54s)

[programs all the time and it's like oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m56s)

[oh yeah great one more thing that you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h16m58s)

[know just analyzes my code base](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m01s)

[but this one is actually rather clever i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m03s)

[like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m06s)

[there's been a an app i've had on my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m07s)

[wish list for a while to build](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m09s)

[and this thing's actually pretty close](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m11s)

[to it so it runs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m12s)

[it generates this you saw that that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m14s)

[window flash](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m16s)

[it does generate out an html version of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m18s)

[the report as well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m20s)

[uh we're not going to use that we're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m22s)

[just going to go to the dashboard](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m24s)

[because like i said there's there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m26s)

[multiple ways you can interact with this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m27s)

[and i would prefer i would prefer this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m29s)

[one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m33s)

[and so you'll note because i fed it my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m33s)

[code coverage file it shows me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m35s)

[my code coverage which is great and not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m37s)

[overly shocking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m40s)

[right like this project didn't have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m42s)

[tests until fairly recently](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m43s)

[so i'm not so i'm not shocked and the ui](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m45s)

[tests that we write](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m48s)

[don't generate coverage so this number](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m50s)

[is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m53s)

[a little bit misleading so but then you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m55s)

[know gives you some](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m57s)

[some stuff here the the other cool thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h17m59s)

[this is the estimated amount of effort](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m02s)

[it would take to throw away your project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m04s)

[and rewrite it from scratch so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m06s)

[uh what is that like one and a half i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m08s)

[guess like one and a quarter man years](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m11s)

[or something like that so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m13s)

[that's a decent amount tech debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m14s)

[we have 47 days worth of tech debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m19s)

[we got a c rating and then this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m22s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m25s)

[i found this to be interesting and again](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m25s)

[some of these are a little bit arbitrary](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m27s)

[because you get to kind of control these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m29s)

[thresholds](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m30s)

[which is which is useful um and you kind](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m31s)

[of got to tweak this a little bit to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m34s)

[match](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m36s)

[to match what what you need as well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m36s)

[right so this is how much to go from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m38s)

[wherever the the c threshold is to the b](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m40s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m43s)

[other metrics how many lines of comments](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m44s)

[useful stuff to keep track of when](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m47s)

[you're looking at what is the magnitude](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m49s)

[of my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m50s)

[my project um i found the more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m51s)

[interesting stuff over here so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m54s)

[obviously down here these graphs are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m56s)

[pretty meaningless at the moment because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h18m58s)

[we just have an initial baseline i don't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m00s)

[actually have a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m02s)

[a trend per se because this this hasn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m03s)

[lasted but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m06s)

[i'm i'm going to leave this on the the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m07s)

[my machine and run it on the project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m10s)

[and maybe we'll check back in like six](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m12s)

[months and see how things go and just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m14s)

[see what the deltas are because i think](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m16s)

[that might be useful because right now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m18s)

[basically](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m20s)

[we've just created the baseline and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m21s)

[that's about it so let's look at the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m23s)

[quality gates because this is the more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m25s)

[interesting ones right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m26s)

[because ah so this is one thing that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m27s)

[did note in my feedback already](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m30s)

[is i run with a lot of my fonts set](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m32s)

[bigger and this thing doesn't scale](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m34s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m36s)

[i've actually noticed this on a lot of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m38s)

[visual studio extensions](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m39s)

[it's like people don't assume that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m41s)

[people use anything other than default](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m43s)

[font size](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m44s)

[it's really annoying really annoying so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m45s)

[this window not friendly to big font](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m48s)

[sizes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m52s)

[so let me see if i can get my way here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m54s)

[so uh the the quality gates so the three](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h19m57s)

[that it failed me on so a percentage of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m00s)

[code coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m02s)

[okay get it yeah that's fine whatever](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m03s)

[critical rules violated now this i care](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m06s)

[about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m08s)

[yeah and it's got the little help here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m09s)

[blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m11s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m12s)

[let's make this bigger let's make this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m13s)

[bigger oh and i want](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m14s)

[i need to zoom it running because zoom](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m17s)

[it's cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m19s)

[okay so this is the other thing that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m20s)

[thought was really cool and this is the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m22s)

[part that i've](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m23s)

[i've wanted to build something like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m24s)

[what's up in this thing here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m26s)

[because i've i've dreamed of having a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m28s)

[tool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m30s)

[that can do most of my code reviews for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m31s)

[me i do a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m35s)

[ton of code reviews throughout the day](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m36s)

[in fact i would argue that i i spend](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m38s)

[probably at least half of my day](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m40s)

[doing code reviews and the really](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m42s)

[frustrating part is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m44s)

[no matter how much of the process i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m45s)

[automate they're still](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m47s)

[like i've got a couple little tools that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m49s)

[i've built that'll do things like use](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m51s)

[regex to just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m53s)

[hunt certain things in people's diffs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m54s)

[that are just obvious red flags](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m56s)

[right just because i'm bored of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h20m58s)

[commenting on the same issues time and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m00s)

[time again](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m02s)

[you either end up writing analyzers to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m04s)

[hunt them out or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m06s)

[or just hunt them with regex because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m09s)

[analyzers are great but they're only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m11s)

[good against](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m13s)

[code and sometimes the flaws are outside](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m14s)

[of code which doesn't really help that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m16s)

[much](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m18s)

[and sometimes they're specific to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m19s)

[whatever project i'm on and whatever](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m20s)

[but this this they give you link](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m22s)

[they give you link over something that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m25s)

[is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m27s)

[um that's uh an object model that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m29s)

[actually pretty friendly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m32s)

[right so i can](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m34s)

[right and let's see what is it r dot](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m37s)

[and i can go through and i i've got](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m40s)

[intellisense on this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m42s)

[this is wonderful this was probably the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m44s)

[thing that made my day](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m48s)

[i was like i have full link](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m49s)

[on an object model that i can use to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m53s)

[build out rules okay so let's let's look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m55s)

[at some of the rules that we actually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m57s)

[violated because this is just showing me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h21m58s)

[the the critical rules which is not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m00s)

[overly interesting so avoid types that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m02s)

[are too big right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m04s)

[okay so one it's gone through and shown](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m05s)

[me and i'm gonna i'm gonna make this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m08s)

[window](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m09s)

[actually you know what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m10s)

[we're going to bring this thing front](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m11s)

[and center](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m12s)

[because i think this thing needs to this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m14s)

[thing needs to be big there's a there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m15s)

[a lot of cool stuff in here and i just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m17s)

[want this window big](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m19s)

[um so it goes through it shows me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m20s)

[you know which which classes are big so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m24s)

[not overly exciting right and then you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m27s)

[know the debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m30s)

[and the annual interest i.e the cost of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m30s)

[not fixing it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m33s)

[but then more importantly if i go well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m34s)

[hang on what does it define is too big](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m36s)

[right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m39s)

[like i can just look right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m39s)

[i can come up here and go okay what does](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m43s)

[it mean for a type to be too big](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m45s)

[and i can come in here and go okay so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m48s)

[it's going to iterate over my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m50s)

[types right and it's gonna warn](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m51s)

[uh if the count of items that it finds](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m55s)

[is greater than zero](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m57s)

[but so from the types and this then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h22m58s)

[there's the where clause right so this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m00s)

[is similar to just your straight link](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m02s)

[commands that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m04s)

[that i'm sure most of us have written](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m05s)

[already right so number of lines of code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m06s)

[greater than 200 so if we come in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m09s)

[and it's actually somewhat intelligent](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m13s)

[about when it counts too](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m15s)

[because it tries to identify the just my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m16s)

[code portion right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m20s)

[because there's some lines that aren't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m21s)

[necessarily your code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m23s)

[right like if i get 205 lines but you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m25s)

[know](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m28s)

[18 of them are comments does that matter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m29s)

[right so there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m31s)

[there's some smarts built into this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m32s)

[syntactic model](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m34s)

[that's not always obvious](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m36s)

[and then also let's see what else are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m39s)

[they checking in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m41s)

[so methods and constructors what matters](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m42s)

[is the number of lines of code in just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m46s)

[my code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m47s)

[agreed right um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m48s)

[uh yeah and this this is a key thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m52s)

[that that where most other things fall](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m55s)

[short right is a lot of times they look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m57s)

[um at the assembly which is the compiled](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h23m59s)

[il](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m02s)

[and as this comment indicates when you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m03s)

[write a link statement](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m05s)

[a few lines of link can get compiled](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m07s)

[into](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m10s)

[the huge numbers of il instructions](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m10s)

[which is usually so if you hear people](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m14s)

[make comments about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m16s)

[link not being performant that's usually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m17s)

[what they're driving at that and the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m20s)

[allocations of the enumerators](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m21s)

[innumerables and enumerators](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m24s)

[however link also usually lets you write](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m28s)

[accurate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m31s)

[less error prone code so until you have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m32s)

[performance benchmark showing you that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m34s)

[it's the slow point](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m36s)

[don't remove it okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m37s)

[but then more importantly you can come](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m42s)

[in here and then just start tweaking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m43s)

[this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m45s)

[right including the the debt and the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m46s)

[annual interest because you'll note each](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m48s)

[of these things that it generates](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m49s)

[these things so here like what happens](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m52s)

[if i do this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m54s)

[uh can i just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m55s)

[oh yeah](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h24m58s)

[that is where did it go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m02s)

[so il instructions do you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m05s)

[select new just my code i was hoping it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m08s)

[would use it for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m16s)

[kind of hoping it would just yeah so you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m20s)

[can build out your own columns i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m23s)

[curious why i didn't change](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m24s)

[this i wonder if there's something else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m27s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m30s)

[affecting those titles but more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m32s)

[importantly you can sort these things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m35s)

[you can do everything that you'd](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m37s)

[normally do with a grid which is just so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m38s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m40s)

[which is so cool okay so let's take a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m43s)

[look so the material design assist so i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m45s)

[can double click and look at this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m46s)

[and this one i don't know if there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m48s)

[much](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m50s)

[there's not a lot in the way of cleaning](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m51s)

[this up right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m53s)

[this is big because we're setting all of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m55s)

[the ma](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m57s)

[app brushes there's a lot of them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h25m58s)

[there's not a lot we can do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m00s)

[okay so this one we're going to ignore](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m03s)

[and you can suppress the issue either by](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m06s)

[putting something in source or moving or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m09s)

[doing like a global suppression file](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m11s)

[i'm kind of tempted to just leave](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m13s)

[leave all these things in rather than](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m17s)

[suppress them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m20s)

[i mean suppressing them is great because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m21s)

[then you don't have to look at them in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m22s)

[your lists anymore and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m24s)

[you'll see your thing count up but i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m25s)

[kind of want to keep an eye on things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m27s)

[i'll let it go um pop-up box this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m31s)

[another one where i'm not overly shocked](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m35s)

[that it's coming up as a big class](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m37s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m39s)

[to some degree i don't mind big classes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m42s)

[and with wpf some of these just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m46s)

[have to be big because you'll note every](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m49s)

[single one of these is a control](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m53s)

[and usually the comp the more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m55s)

[complicated control](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m57s)

[the bigger it gets so i'm going to say](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h26m58s)

[this is probably not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m00s)

[a rule that i care about uh discard](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m02s)

[changes to the following items yes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m05s)

[discard that rule change okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m06s)

[avoid methods that are too big or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m09s)

[complex](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m12s)

[so what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m13s)

[is the big complex method that you care](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m16s)

[about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m19s)

[so animate children interesting why is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m20s)

[this one big](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m22s)

[so first of all uh i lost my tab](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m23s)

[there this tab i wish i could tell](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m27s)

[visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m30s)

[to just stay over here and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m32s)

[oh i undocked everything](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m36s)

[i didn't mean to undock everything i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m39s)

[just meant to move the one thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m40s)

[okay you go sit over there uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m42s)

[oh i messed everything up when i moved](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m45s)

[it front and center didn't i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m48s)

[you go in there you go in there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m50s)

[okay now more importantly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m55s)

[go away](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h27m58s)

[okay so animate children so it claims](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m01s)

[that this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m05s)

[thing is too big so i guess the first](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m05s)

[thing i want to look at is what is the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m08s)

[criteria that it's using so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m09s)

[lines of code this thing has 62 lines](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m11s)

[cyclomatic complexity of 18 which is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m15s)

[high it's it's not unreasonably high but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m19s)

[it's definitely high](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m25s)

[yeah so what is the criteria they're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m28s)

[using so il nesting depth greater than](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m30s)

[two](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m33s)

[and number of lines of code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m33s)

[or encyclomatic complexity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m38s)

[okay so it's looking at a combination of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m43s)

[if you have a lot of nesting and a lot](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m47s)

[of length](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m50s)

[then flag it i can get behind that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m52s)

[as a criteria the question is is is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h28m56s)

[there anything in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m00s)

[that could be reasonably cleaned up](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m02s)

[there's definitely some stuff in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m10s)

[that's weird right like this is one of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m11s)

[those areas of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m13s)

[this is a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m15s)

[a coded up storyboard](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m20s)

[and it would be nice](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m24s)

[man it would be nice to kill this it'd](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m27s)

[be nice to kill this entire method off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m29s)

[and put it into](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m31s)

[a into xaml and do it as like a visual](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m33s)

[state](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m36s)

[change because where does this get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m37s)

[called from i'm guessing it's unlikely](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m39s)

[is opened or similar](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m41s)

[right uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m43s)

[yeah is pop-up opened](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m46s)

[right animate children in or animate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m50s)

[them out so this is basically just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m52s)

[one big](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m54s)

[one big thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h29m58s)

[yeah it'd be nice it'd be nice that if](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m04s)

[this thing would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m06s)

[did we declare any visual states on the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m08s)

[sky](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m10s)

[pop-up state is an open state is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m12s)

[enclosed state](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m15s)

[so it does have two visual states i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m16s)

[wonder what's so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m19s)

[complex about this guy that we weren't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m20s)

[able to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m22s)

[because i vaguely remember looking at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m24s)

[this before and i'm i'm wondering what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m25s)

[was so complex](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m27s)

[so it goes hunting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m32s)

[goes to the content presenter looking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m37s)

[for something that's a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m39s)

[button](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m40s)

[oh to rotate the button is that the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m48s)

[intent](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m50s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m52s)

[this i i so i understand why this one's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m55s)

[here i don't know if this is something](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m57s)

[we're actually going to address here so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h30m59s)

[let's move on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m01s)

[uh avoid methods with too many](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m03s)

[parameters okay so the question is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m04s)

[what is too many parameters number of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m07s)

[parameters greater than or equal to 7.](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m09s)

[i can get on board with that large](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m12s)

[parameters](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m14s)

[are problematic](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m15s)

[speak of large parameters okay while](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m22s)

[we're in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m25s)

[i'm just gonna do this because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m26s)

[this at a minimum](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m29s)

[needs formatting so it fits but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m32s)

[generate buttons](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m35s)

[boy that is a lot of parameters so what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m39s)

[calls this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m42s)

[generate buttons find all references](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m43s)

[oh look at that okay so i think what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m49s)

[we're gonna do is we're gonna do a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m51s)

[little cleanup around this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m52s)

[so we're gonna we're gonna clean this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m54s)

[class up a little bit](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m56s)

[while we're in here because i can see it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h31m58s)

[now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m00s)

[once i see it oh oh intellicode](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m01s)

[yes go intellicode you were so close i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m06s)

[wanted the indentation](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m09s)

[but you got pretty close local function](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m10s)

[can be made static well please do that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m14s)

[for me too](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m16s)

[anything else you want to clean up over](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m18s)

[here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m19s)

[uh i guess we can expression body that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m21s)

[guy i tend to think](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m23s)

[like on a lot of these wpf ones if we're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m25s)

[going to use expression bodied members i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m27s)

[definitely like bringing the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m29s)

[lambda down oh target type new yes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m33s)

[c sharp nine love it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m38s)

[love it love it love it um i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m42s)

[leave those enums there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m45s)

[the only thing i don't like doing as an](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m46s)

[expression body member](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m48s)

[i can't get on board with constructors](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m49s)

[it just it feels wrong](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m51s)

[i don't have a good reason for it it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m54s)

[just feels wrong](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m56s)

[like i don't mind if i see other people](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h32m58s)

[doing it i just can't bring myself to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m00s)

[to do it are you just saying unneeded](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m04s)

[simplify member access yeah because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m07s)

[we're already in the clock class](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m10s)

[clean that up too](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m13s)

[uh sure that's a simple thing to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m16s)

[surprised it didn't flag anything else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m22s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m24s)

[well i don't think we're gonna adjust](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m25s)

[that one because one it's private so it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m27s)

[doesn't bother me that much](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m29s)

[um i do wonder let's take a look real](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m32s)

[quick though](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m35s)

[so there are a large number of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m36s)

[things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m38s)

[button radius ratio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m42s)

[because i'm i'm somewhat looking to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m45s)

[what are the different values that get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m48s)

[passed in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m51s)

[right so there is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m53s)

[to do because obviously the enums pass](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h33m57s)

[different values](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m01s)

[is checked items converter what is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m04s)

[oh so this is a callback](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m10s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m13s)

[do these always match](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m18s)

[oh that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m24s)

[wait a minute where is this used it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m28s)

[feels like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m31s)

[so sometimes when you see things that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m32s)

[look like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m34s)

[yeah so this is written as a value](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m36s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m38s)

[and it's only used in code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m40s)

[or limit phrase only used in c sharp](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m44s)

[code it's never](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m46s)

[it's never getting applied as a value](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m47s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m50s)

[because that means i could drop this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m52s)

[and you'll note now that that interface](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m57s)

[is gone i'm betting to this that this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h34m59s)

[still compiles just fine](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m01s)

[even without that interface on there ah](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m03s)

[so this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m06s)

[what are you squawking about here so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m08s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m12s)

[buttons is unhappy what are you on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m12s)

[what are you unhappy about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m19s)

[i cannot convert to i value converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m24s)

[so this guy here oh hush now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m30s)

[so this guy wants an is checked value](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m34s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m36s)

[oh it does need to be a value converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m39s)

[because it's passed in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m42s)

[to a binding here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m44s)

[oh interesting okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m49s)

[so this is weird okay so let's let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m52s)

[if we can clean this up because this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m55s)

[feels like something that should be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h35m57s)

[this feels like some tech debt that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m00s)

[worth cleaning up now that i'm in and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m02s)

[looking at it so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m03s)

[okay so question one right how do you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m05s)

[address](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m08s)

[a thing with a lot of parameters so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m09s)

[usually the question](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m12s)

[or i should say the fix is one so you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m13s)

[can delete it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m16s)

[that's how i fixed the number of bugs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m18s)

[today is there was a method that was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m20s)

[failing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m22s)

[determined that we weren't actually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m22s)

[using any state that was set by the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m24s)

[method or the return so i just deleted](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m26s)

[the method](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m28s)

[so much easier than fixing it but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m29s)

[with all of this how are each of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m32s)

[things used right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m34s)

[so canvas is used](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m36s)

[uh so nothing fancy with sizing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m40s)

[measuring we are demanding a height](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m42s)

[because these are the buttons for the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m45s)

[clock and i'm feeling very confident](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m47s)

[editing this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m49s)

[because we've got a bunch of ui tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m50s)

[around this very specific thing so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m51s)

[if this is broken i got some tests that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m54s)

[should hopefully flag it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m56s)

[so this guy here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h36m58s)

[is basically used to get the center of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m04s)

[the canvas right there's some error](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m06s)

[checking at the beginning](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m07s)

[then he gets the center oh it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m09s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m12s)

[this guy here show me your usages](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m12s)

[can i do containing member](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m23s)

[oh interesting so it's set in oh i hate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m26s)

[seeing this i hate seeing this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m29s)

[so i hate seeing the so there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m33s)

[implicit coupling here and i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m36s)

[remember the exact name of it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m37s)

[i'm blanking on the name but the idea is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m41s)

[when you have an api that assumes that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m43s)

[your](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m45s)

[your methods have to be invoked in a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m45s)

[particular order](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m47s)

[right so this guy here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m49s)

[is making the sweeping assumption that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m53s)

[this point is going to actually be set](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m55s)

[to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m57s)

[valid values right now the default of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h37m58s)

[point is 0](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m00s)

[0 so maybe it's not that big of a deal](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m01s)

[if it fails because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m02s)

[it just hasn't been set but it is making](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m04s)

[the assumption that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m07s)

[before this handler gets invoked that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m10s)

[the the center of the canvas](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m12s)

[that point has been set and that may be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m14s)

[a reasonable thing-ish um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m18s)

[but it does reek of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m21s)

[um coding flaws so let's see and then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m24s)

[range is almost assuredly important](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m27s)

[because that's how many of the buttons](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m29s)

[we get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m31s)

[uh though this one i wonder if we could](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m33s)

[change up what does it do with the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m36s)

[buttons it adds them to the children](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m38s)

[because we could probably start to break](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m40s)

[this up a little bit](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m42s)

[break this up a little bit so is checked](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m44s)

[value converter so this is literally](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m46s)

[for the checks value converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m50s)

[okay style property selector i imagine](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m54s)

[it's probably almost identical](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m56s)

[so two things that are all around sh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h38m59s)

[that are being used just in this one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m01s)

[place](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m03s)

[where's this get binding method used is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m04s)

[it just used there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m07s)

[let's look so it's used in generate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m09s)

[buttons](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m11s)

[i'm ignoring the second set of hits down](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m13s)

[here because the only difference is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m15s)

[these is target framework and we don't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m16s)

[have a lot of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m17s)

[like pound diffs so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m19s)

[this is only used inside of that method](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m25s)

[step one we're going to move this guy](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m25s)

[inside because there's no reason not to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m27s)

[all right so we're going to come in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m32s)

[replace private with](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m34s)

[static](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m36s)

[let's see uh we can't do static because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m40s)

[it uses this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m42s)

[we'll set it up like that i generally](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m45s)

[declare my local functions as static by](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m47s)

[default now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m50s)

[with the idea being that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m52s)

[if the if it is possible to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m55s)

[uh have it be static i want it to be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h39m58s)

[we're just gonna do a return there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m01s)

[there's not a lot of gain to be had but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m04s)

[to make it obvious what's going on we're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m06s)

[gonna new line all these things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m08s)

[out right never should you reduce lines](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m10s)

[of code at the cost of clarity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m13s)

[okay so we still haven't dropped](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m17s)

[anything out of here we still have this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m19s)

[weird style selector for this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m20s)

[clock item button and format how are you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m22s)

[used](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m26s)

[just to set](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m36s)

[so there and the other thing is i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m39s)

[noticing we've got stuff like this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m41s)

[right that is if the mode is this then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m43s)

[do this otherwise do this other thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m46s)

[man i don't know this might be a harder](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h40m58s)

[one to refactor](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m00s)

[i'm gonna punt and come back to it let's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m03s)

[keep looking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m05s)

[let's keep looking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m06s)

[uh what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m10s)

[i missed that error message](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m15s)

[why can i not open you cannot open](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m19s)

[declaration and source files](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m21s)

[n a because of interface](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m24s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m28s)

[adding this this feels weird why can i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m32s)

[not navigate to an interface](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m35s)

[uh where's my where's my feedback](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m42s)

[uh to interface types](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h41m47s)

[uh so if i do this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m02s)

[and i can do a little screenshot and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m06s)

[grab that drop a little screenshot in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m11s)

[there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m15s)

[hold those notes for now okay we'll come](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m16s)

[back to that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m18s)

[that feels like a bug um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m19s)

[but that is that is saying that the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m23s)

[snack bar message](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m25s)

[let's jump to that i don't think i'm i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m26s)

[fairly familiar with this interface and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m30s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m32s)

[uh yeah i'm i can guarantee it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m34s)

[flagging these ones](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m37s)

[and there's nothing we're gonna ignore](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m38s)

[those](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m40s)

[it's a wild kevin yes it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m42s)

[yes it is a wild kevin and we are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m45s)

[huh oh pop-up ex oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m49s)

[um let's bring this guy over and look at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m53s)

[it we are playing around with independ](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m55s)

[tonight to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m58s)

[try and see what we can learn about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h42m59s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m01s)

[and make it better](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m02s)

[stackbar message queue item constructor](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m06s)

[has too many parameters well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m09s)

[i can certainly agree with that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m10s)

[can certainly agree with that so the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m14s)

[question though](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m16s)

[is i imagine we use most of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m17s)

[or somebody uses most of these yeah like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m23s)

[this one so is there anything in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m27s)

[that would make](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m30s)

[sense so an obvious way to cut this down](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m30s)

[right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m34s)

[is these three guys here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m35s)

[are all tied to the specific](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m38s)

[action right and it doesn't make a lot](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m41s)

[like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m45s)

[you may only have content you may not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m45s)

[care about an argument to pass to your](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m48s)

[handler](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m50s)

[right like it is possible to specify all](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m51s)

[these things but it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m53s)

[also probably better](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m54s)

[to have a a wrapper type around this so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h43m59s)

[i think this one we actually address](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m02s)

[a message queue item](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m05s)

[and i think what we do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m09s)

[yeah so let's let's clean this up um so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m13s)

[the the hard part now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m16s)

[naming it and i so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m17s)

[if this were an app i would probably not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m21s)

[be using a class here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m23s)

[this would be the word record right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m24s)

[because we've got c sharp nine and c](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m28s)

[sharp nine records are awesome](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m30s)

[um if anybody wants to learn about more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m32s)

[about them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m35s)

[uh hold on shameless self plug](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m36s)

[shameless self plug uh this essential c](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m40s)

[sharp nine talk](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m44s)

[that me and mark michaelis did that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m45s)

[the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m47s)

[the top one here um you can go and learn](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m48s)

[about all of the awesomeness that is in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m51s)

[c sharp nine](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m53s)

[um the problem being this library gets](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m54s)

[consumed by older frameworks we still](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m57s)

[have support for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h44m59s)

[net four six two](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m00s)

[something like that regardless older.net](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m05s)

[and though you can create records and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m09s)

[use them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m12s)

[they are not nearly as easy to consume](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m12s)

[by older frameworks so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m16s)

[and i try to keep the bar for entry on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m19s)

[the api](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m22s)

[as absolutely as low as i can get it i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m22s)

[don't mind getting fancy within the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m25s)

[library](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m27s)

[but the public api i try to keep as](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m28s)

[simple as possible so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m30s)

[public class let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m33s)

[it feels like snack bar](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m37s)

[i'm hesitant to just take this name and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m41s)

[then tack the word like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m43s)

[action onto it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m46s)

[snack bar](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m50s)

[item well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m53s)

[i don't like the name but we're going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m56s)

[with it we're going with it for the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m58s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h45m59s)

[right and so what we would do is we do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m00s)

[something like public](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m03s)

[object uh let's see content](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m04s)

[right and we'll let this be mutable fact](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m10s)

[we'll let everything be mutable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m13s)

[uh let's see the second one is going to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m15s)

[be an action](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m17s)

[you'll also note that we do have notable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m18s)

[reference types turned on in the library](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m20s)

[so totally love it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m24s)

[they are a a pain to go through and add](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m27s)

[to an existing code base](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m30s)

[and ever so worth it so if you are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m32s)

[actively making](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m35s)

[updates to a library and you have time](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m37s)

[to pay off some tech debt i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m39s)

[i highly recommend that you consider it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m41s)

[as an option](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m43s)

[the easiest thing to do is turn it on at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m47s)

[your project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m49s)

[and then write a little powershell or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m50s)

[something that does](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m54s)

[puts that at the top of all your files](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h46m58s)

[and then as you get to each file](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m01s)

[go through and turn nullability back on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m03s)

[you'll note it's now flagging all the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m05s)

[question marks saying oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m07s)

[nullable's turned off this isn't valid](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m08s)

[syntax and then you go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m10s)

[time to do it because once you turn](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m12s)

[nullable reference types on it's kind of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m14s)

[like async and wait it just propagates](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m16s)

[everywhere](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m17s)

[the difference is you can turn it off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m19s)

[with that pound nullable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m20s)

[directive so what you can do then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m22s)

[to clean this guy up you should go here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m26s)

[you go here and you change this guy to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m31s)

[be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m36s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m38s)

[and we'll let that guy be optional right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m42s)

[and that on indent](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m46s)

[this guy comes here and i think what we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m50s)

[do is we just go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m52s)

[we do this right and we go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m57s)

[so i'm intentionally doing it this way](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h47m58s)

[and i'll explain in a moment](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m00s)

[uh kind of like that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m02s)

[kind of like that kind of like that and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m06s)

[then this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m08s)

[content and actually this is a bad name](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m11s)

[because we've already got action in the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m15s)

[class name](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m18s)

[um i think i would call it handler](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m20s)

[argument though](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m25s)

[just just to be clear that this is the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m28s)

[argument that will be passed back](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m30s)

[into your handler right so if you want](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m32s)

[something fed back into you you can do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m35s)

[it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m37s)

[it's kind of a little bit meaningless](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m37s)

[given this delegate because if you can](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m39s)

[pass it here you can probably capture it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m40s)

[in your delegate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m42s)

[but this makes sometimes doing that gets](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m44s)

[gets a little yucky and so letting it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m47s)

[flow this way is perfectly fine](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m49s)

[and then what we do is we go obsolete](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m52s)

[use overload uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h48m57s)

[with](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m02s)

[uh two pass action item](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m08s)

[data um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m12s)

[yeah and then the question so this would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m17s)

[be one way to handle it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m19s)

[i don't i'm gonna leave it for now i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m20s)

[don't know if i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m23s)

[commit it i gotta think about that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m24s)

[okay so let's let's let's double back](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m27s)

[because this is no longer needed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m30s)

[ah so one thing i did get so one thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m31s)

[that confused me on the ui](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m34s)

[initially when i was playing with it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m36s)

[when you dive into this you'll note](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m37s)

[you're inside one of the visual studio](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m39s)

[tabbed windows](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m41s)

[but these windows have their own tabs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m43s)

[ver confused me at first it was not when](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m47s)

[was not expecting them to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m50s)

[to do that because now i've got tabs of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m51s)

[tabs however it's not bad once you get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m53s)

[your](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m56s)

[once you get the hang of it okay so we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m56s)

[come back](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h49m59s)

[close that come back here a name spaces](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m01s)

[that are mutually dependent](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m03s)

[this one this one's probably a lot more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m05s)

[interesting and this is not a quick and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m09s)

[easy fix](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m11s)

[so the idea here is that in general](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m12s)

[you you don't want circular dependencies](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m16s)

[in your code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m18s)

[your world gets miserable very quick](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m20s)

[and what this is calling out is that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m23s)

[there are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m25s)

[why is it saying this one shouldn't use](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m27s)

[material design colors](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m29s)

[oh because this is in the recommended](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m31s)

[namespace and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m33s)

[so with types it's usually pretty](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m34s)

[obvious right it's it's usually very](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m36s)

[easy to look at two types and figure out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m38s)

[okay this type depend](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m40s)

[you know a depends on b but then b](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m41s)

[depends on a and it's and usually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m43s)

[those things tease themselves out pretty](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m46s)

[quick and you get bit in like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m47s)

[serialization in other areas where](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m49s)

[where that circular reference name](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m51s)

[namespaces are much more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m52s)

[subtle right because having mutually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m54s)

[dependent namespaces](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m57s)

[doesn't cause a compiler doesn't cause a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h50m59s)

[runtime error](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m02s)

[it's it your app probably works](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m02s)

[perfectly fine](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m05s)

[and it won't necessarily cause a bug but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m06s)

[it's an architectural smell because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m09s)

[if you've got two name spaces that are](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m11s)

[dependent on each other](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m13s)

[it gets very difficult to kind of deal](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m14s)

[with that dependency graph so refactors](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m17s)

[can start to become](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m19s)

[a pain and that's where you start to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m20s)

[things sprawl out where it's like oh i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m22s)

[expected to change this one little thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m24s)

[and now it's big and scary so that one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m26s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m29s)

[this one is probably just a naming](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m30s)

[problem with these material design color](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m32s)

[recommended right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m34s)

[if we look at one of these things this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m36s)

[is down here only to be simple](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m39s)

[i don't know i don't think i'm going to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m42s)

[change that because this namespace isn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m44s)

[necessarily meant for grouping](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m46s)

[as much as communicating intent and so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m48s)

[i'm a little less concerned of it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m51s)

[um this guy is saying](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m53s)

[this generate buttons hello hello](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h51m57s)

[is leveraging our converter's namespace](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m01s)

[right and then the issue that it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m04s)

[flagging is the converter's namespace](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m06s)

[or i should say this converter in the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m09s)

[namespace is now referencing an enum](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m11s)

[back in the other namespace in general](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m14s)

[one-way street down](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m16s)

[so the question would be oh well that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m17s)

[remove redundant assignment we'll clean](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m22s)

[that up while we're in here um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m23s)

[oh fine i just i can't resist cleaning](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m26s)

[up code i just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m28s)

[i see it and once i see it i can't unsee](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m30s)

[it and then i have to fix it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m32s)

[and make it prettier um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m34s)

[so one fix for this would be to move the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m37s)

[enum](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m40s)

[into a different namespace i think i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m40s)

[going to ignore this for now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m44s)

[partially because that guy is just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m49s)

[internal and i don't care to address it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m51s)

[right now](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m53s)

[ultimately with the way that value](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m54s)

[converter is being used](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m55s)

[it almost could be in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m57s)

[[Applause]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h52m59s)

[because of the way this value converter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m01s)

[is used i almost question if this guy is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m03s)

[in the wrong name space](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m05s)

[and if this guy should in fact be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m07s)

[a nested class](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m10s)

[i i do wonder if he should be like a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m16s)

[private class inside of clock](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m18s)

[um but that's neither here nor there so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m20s)

[let's take a look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m23s)

[so these are all demo app things and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m24s)

[i really could care less about the demo](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m28s)

[so the and not to say that the demo code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m31s)

[is poor because i do try to make sure](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m34s)

[that it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m38s)

[a reasonable thing to look at but the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m39s)

[demo app code is designed to show the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m40s)

[breadth of what's possible](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m42s)

[you are absolutely free to take code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m45s)

[from the demo app and use it in yours](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m47s)

[the one thing i will cautious caution](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m50s)

[you on is the demo app](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m52s)

[shows a breadth of what's possible and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m53s)

[you probably don't want every single](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m57s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h53m59s)

[in your app right like for example it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m00s)

[shows](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m02s)

[mvvm and code behind patterns because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m03s)

[both should be easily possible right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m06s)

[with the library](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m07s)

[you probably want to pick one and use](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m09s)

[that in your app](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m11s)

[not use both so things like that just be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m12s)

[aware of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m15s)

[so i'm gonna i'm gonna ignore this this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m17s)

[one doesn't bother me near as much](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m18s)

[non-read-only static fields oh this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m20s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m23s)

[let's take a look at this uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m24s)

[so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m28s)

[cannot open declaration in source file](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m32s)

[source declaration of field is not yet](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m35s)

[parsed by independent the parent type](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m37s)

[source](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m38s)

[oh okay so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m40s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m43s)

[so what exactly non-read-only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m49s)

[static fields well that's easy this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m53s)

[should be read-only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h54m57s)

[i i generally agree with this rule okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m03s)

[that one's fixed boom done uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m04s)

[these ones](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m07s)

[can you fix these i believe so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m11s)

[right make these read only you shouldn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m17s)

[be reassigning these instances](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m19s)

[ever so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m21s)

[i think we're gonna clean all of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m24s)

[up while i'm in here i just can't resist](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m26s)

[i can't resist cleaning stuff up uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m29s)

[so there's there's the two dialogue](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m33s)

[hosts drawer host](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m35s)

[similar thing right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m37s)

[both of you should be read only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m40s)

[and then target type new because yay c](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m43s)

[sharp nine we're just gonna we're gonna](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m46s)

[slowly convert the code base one by one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m49s)

[so the flip command we can do the same](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m52s)

[thing so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m54s)

[make you read only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h55m56s)

[and again this isn't that big of a deal](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m00s)

[but it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m03s)

[it is accurately calling out that if](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m05s)

[somebody wanted to reassign this command](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m07s)

[to a different instance](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m09s)

[that could cause some unexpected](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m10s)

[behaviors](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m13s)

[do they give more explanation uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m15s)

[the natural to hold states can be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m19s)

[modified is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m21s)

[instance field such immutable static](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m22s)

[fields create confusion about the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m24s)

[expected state at runtime](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m26s)

[and impairs the code testability yep](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m28s)

[completely agree with that statement](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m30s)

[that is absolutely correct](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m32s)

[so not to say statics or or um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m39s)

[these things are always bad some people](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m44s)

[would want to immediately convert these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m46s)

[to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m48s)

[properties i know that for wpf that's a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m48s)

[bit problematic this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m51s)

[one of those cases where um uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m52s)

[practicality of the framework it's to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h56m58s)

[win so hold on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m00s)

[desktop changed count and screens](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m03s)

[what so this is so this code here is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m07s)

[actually directly lifted out of winforms](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m11s)

[uh okay so i don't think you can be made](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m14s)

[read only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m18s)

[yeah i don't think we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m20s)

[anything about you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m22s)

[we're gonna leave you alone um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m25s)

[and just pretend like i didn't look at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m29s)

[that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m31s)

[uh sorry i just i can't resist the urge](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m33s)

[to change code i must](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m36s)

[clean up code and have a massive code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m38s)

[cleanup i'm gonna have to do multiple](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m42s)

[pr's here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m43s)

[that's the only way this is gonna work](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m45s)

[is i will just cue up a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m47s)

[pr's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m49s)

[but we'll do that after the fact clean](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m51s)

[up](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m54s)

[unnecessary there lambda body the member](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m54s)

[there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h57m58s)

[just just a lot of cleanup uh for a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m00s)

[while i know people have actually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m03s)

[um yeah so expression body on the file](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m05s)

[for me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m08s)

[uh yep those all look good](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m10s)

[uh for a while i there were people that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m14s)

[were just submitting code cleanup prs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m16s)

[on the library and i i happily encourage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m18s)

[that the only thing i ask is that if you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m22s)

[do a code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m24s)

[cleanup pr please don't mix it with like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m25s)

[a bug fix](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m27s)

[um separate those those those should be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m28s)

[two separate things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m31s)

[um because it gets very difficult to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m33s)

[to read and parse uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m37s)

[did i actually address the property](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m41s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m44s)

[uh hold on which what were you squawking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m46s)

[about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m50s)

[switched switch track on background](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m50s)

[property](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m54s)

[switch track background off property oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m54s)

[do we have one of these things that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m57s)

[not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h58m59s)

[where is it oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m02s)

[yeah that's bad see once again](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m06s)

[not horrible it's just that somebody](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m09s)

[theoretically could be setting those to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m12s)

[a different property and that would be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m13s)

[not a good thing so we'll clean this one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m16s)

[up too](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m19s)

[and then do oh i should have done the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m20s)

[apply to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m24s)

[apply to document and yep](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m27s)

[do all those that's great and then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m31s)

[read only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m35s)

[no no not what i wanted you to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m39s)

[intellicode](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m41s)

[apply all three telecode you are amazing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m43s)

[when you work](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m46s)

[you are absolutely amazing love](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m47s)

[intellicode](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m50s)

[oh and the key phrase there is when you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m52s)

[work](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m56s)

[because there are definitely times where](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m56s)

[it does not work as expected okay so we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=00h59m58s)

[cleaned up all of those](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m00s)

[in transition finished uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m02s)

[yep](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m06s)

[boom apply suggestion and then while](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m09s)

[we're in here we'll clean this up](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m12s)

[because we can uh sure](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m16s)

[clean you up too](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m19s)

[there that looks nicer again i just i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m23s)

[have a hard time doing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m25s)

[hard time doing expression body](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m27s)

[constructors](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m29s)

[and then snack bar](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m30s)

[are you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m35s)

[you're only set in the constructor why](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m38s)

[you should be read only as well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m40s)

[so you can do target type new](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m45s)

[and if it compiles there's no reason not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m49s)

[to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m51s)

[okay so i believe](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m52s)

[we cleaned up all of them let's just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m57s)

[confirm that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h00m59s)

[oh there was one more thing that came](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m09s)

[out of the net talks earlier](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m11s)

[there is they showed off this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m13s)

[cool upgrade assistant so if you are on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m16s)

[net framework and you want to um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m19s)

[upgrade this will](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m23s)

[this is like one of those great 95](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m27s)

[percent solutions](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m29s)

[because there's infinite things that you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m31s)

[could have done in your older project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m33s)

[it's not always](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m35s)

[obvious on how the upgrade should go but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m35s)

[most of it can be automated](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m38s)

[and so what did microsoft do they](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m40s)

[automated away](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m42s)

[what they could so it'll walk you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m43s)

[through it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m46s)

[show you what it's doing show you its](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m48s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m50s)

[they demoed upgrading an app](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m51s)

[now obviously your mileage may vary](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m55s)

[depending on your project but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m57s)

[if you're looking to go from net](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h01m59s)

[framework and you're like well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m02s)

[why to go to core well or i shouldn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m03s)

[say core](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m05s)

[net five right the goal is to get up to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m06s)

[net five](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m08s)

[um the the hard transition is getting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m10s)

[from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m12s)

[framework to net core three one for wpf](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m13s)

[apps](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m16s)

[and then from three one to five oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m16s)

[don't know as if i've run into a single](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m19s)

[instance where i had to do anything](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m22s)

[other than just toggle the framework](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m24s)

[all of the the massive breaking stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m27s)

[comes with framework decor](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m29s)

[so oh i should share that so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m31s)

[if people are interested there's that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m35s)

[okay so there uh what is your problem](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m38s)

[uh oh this is being assigned in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m43s)

[a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m46s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m49s)

[you are problematic because that would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m52s)

[need to be assigned in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m55s)

[a static constructor and that is an](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m56s)

[instance constructor so we're just going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m58s)

[to ignore that because that's the demo](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h02m59s)

[app](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m00s)

[cool let's see what else we got avoid](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m02s)

[having different types of the same name](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m05s)

[oh boy i am highly highly guilty of this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m06s)

[um this feels like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m15s)

[so i get it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m19s)

[but here's my problem](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m22s)

[wait we have two data grid combobox](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m26s)

[columns](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m28s)

[so some of these i don't think i'm going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m29s)

[to address because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m31s)

[it doesn't make sense to because they](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m33s)

[would be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m36s)

[because they if you rename one of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m37s)

[things it's going to be breaking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m39s)

[so for example main window i could care](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m42s)

[less](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m45s)

[right um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m46s)

[i am a little shocked](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m52s)

[show me can i see both the types oh look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h03m57s)

[at that yeah so there's one in demo](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m00s)

[and one in my apps demo so yeah could](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m02s)

[care less](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m05s)

[um button assist why do we have two](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m06s)

[button assists](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m09s)

[so one in demo one in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m13s)

[the library we could rename the demo one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m17s)

[to change it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m19s)

[and it this is actually probably not a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m23s)

[bad idea because i have had bug reports](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m25s)

[come in where people are confused](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m28s)

[because of duplicate type names](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m32s)

[this is probably not a bad idea i'm more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m36s)

[concerned with this one where is my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m37s)

[second data grid column](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m39s)

[oh i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m47s)

[introduced this one interesting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m50s)

[because before this class was called](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h04m56s)

[material design data grid combo box](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m00s)

[column and it was a big long](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m02s)

[ugly name](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m04s)

[i'll have to think about changing that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m13s)

[i don't know if i should](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m16s)

[um this one is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m20s)

[a known one because of the way we're](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m23s)

[linking in files](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m26s)

[i don't think it's something i care to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m29s)

[address](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m31s)

[but this is actually good to keep in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m33s)

[mind because we've run into bugs before](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m35s)

[where i've pushed updates](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m37s)

[and there's naming conflicts between say](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m39s)

[my apps or control zx](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m41s)

[because we all leverage the same stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m44s)

[and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m47s)

[version mismatches abound](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m48s)

[okay so that handles](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m52s)

[the critical violations where'd my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m55s)

[dashboard go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h05m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m02s)

[i think i closed it didn't i dashboard](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m04s)

[hey look at that it's got a nice nice](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m07s)

[fancy button to get me right there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m09s)

[okay so that's critical rules](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m10s)

[let's look at high priority rules](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m14s)

[method should have a low crap score okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m18s)

[that is awesome um i've seen this before](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m24s)

[let's see r a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m24s)

[p oh i wonder if they have a link in the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m28s)

[description i should just open it first](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m30s)

[they might have a link to this for what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m32s)

[is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m35s)

[the crap score uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m36s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m39s)

[first to find here yep this probably the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m41s)

[exact link i was looking for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m43s)

[this guy so we dropped this in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m46s)

[so uh yes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m49s)

[this one i've come across before uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m52s)

[effectively](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m55s)

[so people have constantly tried to look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h06m56s)

[for an objective way to measure the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m00s)

[quality](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m03s)

[of code um it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m04s)

[really really hard um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m07s)

[and this is this is one attempt to try](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m12s)

[and measure the quality of the code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m16s)

[right um and in general things like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m20s)

[cyclomatic complexity boil into a line](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m23s)

[of code boils into it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m25s)

[some people will do indentation the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m28s)

[question comes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m30s)

[how do you do you make it language](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m31s)

[specific or agnostic and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m33s)

[all that kind of stuff this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m35s)

[is pretty cool though so what is the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m38s)

[so what is the criteria](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m42s)

[so oh and this also uses](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m45s)

[oh this uses the code coverage data](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m49s)

[ah so cyclomatic complexity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m53s)

[code coverage oh this is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h07m58s)

[okay this is really cool i like this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m02s)

[i like this because i would probably](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m07s)

[agree](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m11s)

[that in all of these cases](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m11s)

[yeah and it breaks it down here so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m15s)

[there's your cyclomatic complexity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m16s)

[and this is your code coverage metrics](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m19s)

[lines of code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m22s)

[debt and then severity is just i believe](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m24s)

[tied to the rule](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m26s)

[yeah because severity is just hardcoded](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m28s)

[to high in this case](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m30s)

[so there's that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m32s)

[i really really so they've got crap](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m36s)

[built](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m40s)

[oh no they don't have it built in they](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m41s)

[calculated it here right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m43s)

[so there there it is cyclomatic](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m46s)

[complexity squared](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m48s)

[times uncovered cubed plus cyclomatic](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m50s)

[complexity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h08m54s)

[okay that is i do love how it shows the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m00s)

[percent coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m04s)

[as a bar graph that's really slick](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m06s)

[that is really slick okay so how](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m10s)

[does this thing sort was it already](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m14s)

[sorted i think it may have already been](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m16s)

[sorted](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m17s)

[uh so the worst one is that animate](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m18s)

[children in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m21s)

[so it i'm noted there's a common pattern](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m21s)

[here right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m24s)

[if it doesn't matter what metric you use](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m25s)

[in general your same hot areas are gonna](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m28s)

[always](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m32s)

[bubble up to the top for any algorithms](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m33s)

[that's worth it salt there's obviously](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m36s)

[differences and people try to optimize](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m38s)

[and say well this is better than this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m39s)

[and yada yada yada](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m40s)

[but in general the same code pops up](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m44s)

[like this one here right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m46s)

[so this one oops](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m48s)

[um get pop-up placement right so it has](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m51s)

[a very high crap score and so the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m55s)

[threshold they've got set here is 30.](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h09m57s)

[we're at 240. so way over it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m04s)

[and i don't so and so the question would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m08s)

[be how would you lower this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m11s)

[right one could be increased code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m13s)

[coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m15s)

[would help fix it lower the lines of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m16s)

[code or lower the cyclomatic complexity](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m18s)

[right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m21s)

[those are your three choices](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m21s)

[and honestly the i think the hard part](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m25s)

[is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m30s)

[you just i guess we could write tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m34s)

[over it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m38s)

[that would probably be the easiest way](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m38s)

[to address this is actually write some](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m40s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m42s)

[that wouldn't be a that wouldn't be bad](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m46s)

[these ones here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m48s)

[are not going to be doable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m50s)

[simply because these are mouse event](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m54s)

[handlers and the issue being that the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h10m58s)

[way we would test these is with the ui](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m01s)

[tests and my ui tests aren't reporting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m03s)

[coverage numbers](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m04s)

[so that is a flaw in xaml test](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m06s)

[is because it doesn't report coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m09s)

[numbers because it's a little difficult](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m12s)

[to do so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m15s)

[you it's all they're going to show up](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m18s)

[and that's ultimately the way i would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m20s)

[test these is with a ui](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m22s)

[test not with a unit test so this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m23s)

[this is kind of misleading and that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m26s)

[that is one thing that i've noticed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m28s)

[about this is it appears to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m29s)

[only support the c sharp side of the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m31s)

[code not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m34s)

[the xaml based side which gets a little](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m34s)

[annoying at times](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m38s)

[so this is interesting i thought we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m41s)

[actually had](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m42s)

[pretty good coverage on this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m44s)

[clearly the answer is no](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m48s)

[so collapse that so we don't have any](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m52s)

[direct tests over this oh and it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m56s)

[probably because this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m57s)

[is internal all the way around](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h11m59s)

[that's probably why so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m02s)

[culture get date format so yeah so this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m07s)

[is going to be one of those cases and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m09s)

[this might even be related to my test](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m10s)

[failures](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m12s)

[um sorry i'm just kind of spot checking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m14s)

[these to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m17s)

[if any of these stand out of something](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m18s)

[that should get addressed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m20s)

[i don't know let's circle back to those](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m22s)

[uh let's see so we've already done](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m27s)

[i wonder if i come back here can i run](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m30s)

[yeah let's run a test because we fixed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m33s)

[all those static field ones](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m35s)

[so i would expect these 18 issues on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m37s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m40s)

[to go away or at least a bunch of them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m43s)

[to go away right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m45s)

[so let's let's let it run and do its](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m47s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m50s)

[as soon as i figure out where that where](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m51s)

[the heck it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m53s)

[oh there it opened and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m55s)

[view and dashboard pretty please](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h12m58s)

[and load it up and hopefully calculates](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m02s)

[a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m06s)

[does a bunch of rules](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m08s)

[okay so our debt has gone down that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m15s)

[good](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m18s)

[we have made the code less yucky](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m19s)

[our coverage went up](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m22s)

[oh it's probably by making things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m27s)

[expression-bodied members maybe](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m29s)

[i don't know why our coverage would have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m32s)

[gone up but it's it's a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m33s)

[teeny percentage um this is so this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m35s)

[what i mean by](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m41s)

[end depend is really it comes in nicely](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m44s)

[at setting a baseline and then adjusting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m47s)

[um as you go right to keep you from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m52s)

[going backwards](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m54s)

[right it's the idea of okay we](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m56s)

[understand we've inherited](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h13m58s)

[some amount of debt or we've agreed to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m00s)

[take on some debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m02s)

[but everything that adds should be a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m03s)

[very explicit decision](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m06s)

[right um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m07s)

[that's pretty cool okay i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m11s)

[think](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m15s)

[what so what did we do here use obsolete](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m16s)

[type](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m19s)

[ah so this is using our now obsolete](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m20s)

[member we should use the overload](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m22s)

[yada yada okay great um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m24s)

[i'm going to ignore that because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m28s)

[theoretically we could](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m29s)

[address it i do want to verify that our](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m31s)

[that our other one went away](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m35s)

[that's not what i was hoping to see i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m38s)

[want to look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m41s)

[at um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m42s)

[take me back here i want to look at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m45s)

[where is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m48s)

[high issues right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m49s)

[code should be tested agreed uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m55s)

[i thought that static field one was in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h14m59s)

[here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m02s)

[struct should be immutable how many](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m05s)

[violations of that do we have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m06s)

[oh just in those color pair isn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m08s)

[immutable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m12s)

[that feels like something i want to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m20s)

[address](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m22s)

[that that might the the problem is is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m26s)

[that's one of those that's a breaking](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m29s)

[level change so i may](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m31s)

[i may say that for later okay so what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m37s)

[else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m40s)

[what else can we do with this so we've](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m40s)

[got issues we can dig through it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m43s)

[that's great um i believe there was more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m45s)

[funness we could have with this uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m49s)

[let's take a look because i thought](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m53s)

[there was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m54s)

[a new issue sourced if blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h15m56s)

[dependency graph this hoy they](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m00s)

[a this is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m04s)

[oh wow](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m08s)

[so not a shocker a lot of things point](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m15s)

[to pack icon](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m19s)

[kind](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m20s)

[this so a this is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m24s)

[the fact that this appears to be vector](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m29s)

[um okay so filter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m32s)

[exclude](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m39s)

[i don't know what this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m42s)

[exclude generated code elements because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m48s)

[i assume that's what that is so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m50s)

[filter yeah that's better i don't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m52s)

[um actually let's turn back on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m55s)

[non-public](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m58s)

[because i'd kind of like to see internal](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h16m59s)

[stuff too](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m01s)

[um okay so we've got a lot so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m03s)

[the the key part here is these lines all](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m06s)

[point in one direction right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m09s)

[i've got you know demo apps because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m10s)

[we've got the maw apps demo](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m13s)

[the the ma apps](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m15s)

[support library in this demo all pointed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m18s)

[at the core library](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m20s)

[which points at the colors library which](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m22s)

[holds a bunch of the colors and themes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m25s)

[and whatnot](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m26s)

[and we've got the resource gen library](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m27s)

[that kind of just sits by itself](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m29s)

[okay we've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m32s)

[stuff sitting here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m38s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m39s)

[list box assist points to ripple](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m42s)

[really uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m46s)

[so how do i see what that dependency is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m50s)

[uh oh that's cool so i've got](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h17m54s)

[so direct collee](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m01s)

[how do i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m04s)

[i okay that's great](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m12s)

[uh how do i get back one class selected](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m16s)

[up arrow nope that's just changing my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m19s)

[menu options i want to go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m23s)

[back uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m27s)

[x nope how do i get](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m29s)

[back back button](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m33s)

[there it is okay um but i want to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m38s)

[understand this dependency](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m42s)

[how do i get maybe i should read](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m43s)

[the hover item represents rating bar](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m47s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m50s)

[it went away nope](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m51s)

[i'm looking at the wrong thing okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m54s)

[so let's look here the hovered item](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h18m58s)

[represents a listbox class](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m00s)

[this directly uses two items and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m02s)

[indirectly one item](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m04s)

[how to obtain](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m13s)

[colors color graph i want to see this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m16s)

[oh the only other thing i do not like is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m20s)

[on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m22s)

[oh i ah](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m24s)

[the the videos are all set to auto play](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m27s)

[do not like that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m29s)

[um so if i do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m31s)

[this right uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m35s)

[let's see collapse](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m38s)

[why did you zoom me out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m44s)

[collies](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m48s)

[so i want to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m53s)

[this because i want to understand](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h19m58s)

[where this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m02s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m05s)

[so i understand that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m10s)

[i do not understand why this thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m18s)

[okay i i want to i want to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m22s)

[what this thing represents why does](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m26s)

[listbox assist represent ripple](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m30s)

[okay i don't see it uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m33s)

[we'll just dive back to the code because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m37s)

[i can't find it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m39s)

[oh there it is right there and that be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m40s)

[why it doesn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m44s)

[so it uses it for the mouse button](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m45s)

[what do you use the ripple for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m50s)

[ah to raise the event on it to trigger](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m54s)

[the rippling effect](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m56s)

[got it okay that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h20m57s)

[helpful i guess that's worth knowing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m01s)

[about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m04s)

[nothing i can really do uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m05s)

[is there not a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m11s)

[yeah let's just jump back to there okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m15s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m17s)

[look and see this bi-directional bit](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m19s)

[here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m23s)

[i like how it does the the two](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m25s)

[directions](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m27s)

[and then because it kind of gives you a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m30s)

[really good starting point](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m32s)

[and this one i'm not overly surprised at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m34s)

[yeah the the transitioner namespace has](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m42s)

[been](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m45s)

[kind of fraught with parallel a little](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m46s)

[bit and so i'm not overly shocked to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m48s)

[some of the red arrows there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m51s)

[colors name space is usually pretty](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m55s)

[clean or that's converters](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m56s)

[uh so let's see here theme and theme](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h21m59s)

[extensions](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m03s)

[that i'm pretty sure i already know what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m05s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m07s)

[uh that not interested in because that's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m09s)

[the winform stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m11s)

[same with this one those are expected to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m12s)

[be tightly coupled and more importantly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m16s)

[you know the little plus symbol um this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m18s)

[is a nested class](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m20s)

[so i do not mind that coupling there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m21s)

[dialog host so dialog host and dialogue](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m25s)

[session are tightly coupled or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m28s)

[bi-directionally coupled](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m35s)

[well that's cool the edges](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m37s)

[width is proportional in coupling to the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m40s)

[terms of methods and fields involved](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m43s)

[so the thicker the arrow the more the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m45s)

[more coupling there is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m47s)

[um it is interesting i understand and i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m50s)

[know why the dialogue host interacts](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m54s)

[with the stack snack bar message queue i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m56s)

[just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m58s)

[i wish there was a cleaner way to handle](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h22m59s)

[it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m00s)

[um and actually a pub sub model would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m02s)

[probably address this dependency this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m06s)

[actually really nice to be able to go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m08s)

[through and see this and evaluate it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m09s)

[so once again this one here doesn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m12s)

[bother me because this is a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m13s)

[nested class once again nested class](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m16s)

[doesn't bother me converters namespace](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m20s)

[we already kind of looked at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m23s)

[transitions we did what's going on over](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m24s)

[so this was that bi-directional name](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m30s)

[space issue that we looked at before](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m32s)

[that doesn't bother me that's kind of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m34s)

[cool i like that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m36s)

[i like that let's look at the dependency](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m38s)

[matrix](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m41s)

[hoy vay let's see in this menu describe](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m43s)

[it's better suited than a graph to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m47s)

[demystify the structure of large](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m49s)

[complex portion of code because it can](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m51s)

[scale to hundreds of elements](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m54s)

[that's great i use the right-click menus](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h23m55s)

[on rows](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m00s)

[columns and sales to navigate the code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m00s)

[structure](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m03s)

[okay so right click menu is my friend](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m04s)

[let's pick on oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m08s)

[interesting so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m12s)

[right click open one of my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m15s)

[35 oh that's cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m19s)

[so if i expand you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m25s)

[that's kind of neat what happens if i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m29s)

[expand](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m33s)

[that oh cool so i can see how](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m35s)

[these things relate to each other oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m40s)

[that's kind of clever](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m43s)

[direct number of members namespace types](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m46s)

[so this is just number of members then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m49s)

[it looks like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m51s)

[i wonder is there a filter like what was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m54s)

[on the other one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m56s)

[save png picture of the matrix that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h24m57s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m00s)

[export matrix code elements to graph](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m01s)

[that's pretty cool that's pretty cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m06s)

[i don't know if i need to really dive](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m09s)

[too deep into that but that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m11s)

[uh code metrics oh is there a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m13s)

[that's brightly colored and mildly scary](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m18s)

[that's a lot of red uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m22s)

[rectangles on the tree map represent](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m26s)

[methods](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m27s)

[the rectangular size can be proportional](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m30s)

[to the method's number of lines of code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m32s)

[so bigger the box more lines of code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m35s)

[so pretty much the demo app up here is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m42s)

[there a way i can exclude](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m46s)

[projects group by](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m47s)

[like can i just say exclude from this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m51s)

[uh code matrix select issue](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h25m56s)

[i just kind of want to say or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m00s)

[focus one of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m03s)

[so let's see collapse all right because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m06s)

[i really only care about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m08s)

[this one well that's cool so it'll](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m11s)

[show me which ones they are but i can't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m14s)

[just filter](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m18s)

[down to it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m23s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m30s)

[so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m34s)

[don't know what i did on that last one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m41s)

[that's kind of cool percentage coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m44s)

[variable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m47s)

[size lines of code level method let's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m48s)

[just do types](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m50s)

[that's pretty cool that's actually](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m53s)

[rather](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m56s)

[rather convenient right because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m57s)

[oftentimes i see people looking at their](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h26m59s)

[code coverage numbers going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m01s)

[well i don't know what to go write tests](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m03s)

[on this is rather obvious find the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m04s)

[biggest reddish](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m06s)

[block you can and go attack that first](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m08s)

[the big red block is the bad one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m13s)

[oh that's cool and you can filter out so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m16s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m20s)

[basically set your thresholds of where](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m26s)

[things should be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m28s)

[so green will be so if we said that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m30s)

[had](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m32s)

[for hypothetically right if somebody](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m33s)

[said you have a code call](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m36s)

[quality metric of everything has to be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m37s)

[above 80 percent](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m38s)

[right that's everything that's above 80.](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m40s)

[that's pretty slick](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m46s)

[that is pretty slick search types with](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h27m49s)

[go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h28m06s)

[and it's not an interface can i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h28m08s)

[filter this way so let's see n](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h28m11s)

[uh how about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m38s)

[oh namespace like oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m43s)

[man there is so much useful stuff built](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m50s)

[in because it like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m52s)

[i keep going back to how i would do it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m53s)

[with like system.reflection](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m55s)

[um and i would write all of this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h29m57s)

[huh so i can just literally write a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m20s)

[and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m24s)

[i think i just do that right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m30s)

[unrecognized line two column 82.](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m34s)

[column numbers](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m40s)

[adding that list uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m42s)

[does it show what column i'm on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m49s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h30m55s)

[so something like that i'm a little](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h31m11s)

[surprised what is it squawking about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h31m14s)

[here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h31m16s)

[so it doesn't know how to handle that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h31m18s)

[that so if i hit save](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h31m29s)

[right and i go back to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h31m33s)

[i must not understand how this is how](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m06s)

[this is working](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m08s)

[working](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m19s)

[uh let's see here okay so let's go back](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m21s)

[and look at what else independence got](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m24s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m26s)

[so trend charts and metrics we'll look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m27s)

[at this but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m30s)

[i doubt yeah these aren't going to be as](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m30s)

[relevant given that i've only run this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m35s)

[twice](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m36s)

[i think this is going to be more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m37s)

[relevant as we run it more and more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m39s)

[times](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m41s)

[search by criteria oh hold on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m44s)

[explore code coverage what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m47s)

[oh yes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m51s)

[the code coverage metrics](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h32m54s)

[oh break it down](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m00s)

[so this isn't bad the one thing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m05s)

[that the visual studio one has](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m09s)

[that's kind of nice so like for example](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m12s)

[if i just pick on one of these types](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m18s)

[and i'm going to get something with half](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m19s)

[coverage](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m22s)

[right when i open it it starts](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m24s)

[what isn't](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m28s)

[i kind of like that over this setup](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m31s)

[because it makes it a lot more obvious](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m35s)

[now i do want to go turn that off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h33m38s)

[despite my lack of knowledge of it is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m18s)

[pretty cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m21s)

[and being able to arbitrarily query the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m23s)

[based upon this i'm going to call it a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m26s)

[friendly object model over your code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m29s)

[base right it's not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m31s)

[system reflection that's like that is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m32s)

[somewhat ugly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m35s)

[and it's not the rosalind ast right it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m36s)

[is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m39s)

[it is a code structure over your](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m40s)

[that feels a lot more how how a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m45s)

[developer pictures their code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m48s)

[right it works if you were just define](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m51s)

[like if you were going to redesign](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m53s)

[a lot more like this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h34m58s)

[that is cool i am](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m01s)

[if i wanted advanced or](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m13s)

[i don't remember how it phrased it i'll](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m16s)

[call it simpleton mode i turned on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m17s)

[simpleton mode because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m19s)

[i didn't know what i was doing and i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m21s)

[wanted help](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m22s)

[uh devops integration yeah you'll note](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m24s)

[that it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m28s)

[it integrates with pretty much](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m28s)

[however the their documentation has a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m41s)

[um here's how you how you execute to us](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m45s)

[on arbitrary cl](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m48s)

[command line](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m52s)

[so i imagine github actions would be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m53s)

[simple enough to do like that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h35m56s)

[uh let's do assemblies](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m29s)

[okay uh let's just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m33s)

[go here and maybe pick](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m36s)

[i don't know if it's going to find](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m40s)

[anything i don't know if there's much](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m41s)

[for it to find](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m43s)

[but uh sure let's do that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m45s)

[analyze](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m51s)

[uh to show eventual assembly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m56s)

[the two assemblies are resolved this is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h36m59s)

[not enough to try to detect](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m01s)

[versioning issues](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m03s)

[oh interesting i wonder what it's doing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m06s)

[then to detect a versioning issue](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m09s)

[i wonder if it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m11s)

[no i don't that wouldn't make sense](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m15s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m39s)

[uh sure let's i'm curious what this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m43s)

[thing comes up with](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m48s)

[when outside of visual studio 2019](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m51s)

[working on fixing this okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m58s)

[sure great um i get it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h37m59s)

[let's look](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m04s)

[what do you find](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m07s)

[this is kind of cool i actually had a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m11s)

[desire earlier today](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m13s)

[i was hoping to find a roslyn analyzer](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m14s)

[that would spell check identifiers in my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m18s)

[code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m21s)

[the the there's plenty of things out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m22s)

[there that will do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m25s)

[spell checking extensions for visual](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m28s)

[studio there's a bunch](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m30s)

[there's some great ones right but what i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m31s)

[was actually looking for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m34s)

[is an analyzer because i wanted to flag](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m35s)

[things that were misspelled](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m38s)

[and just fell pipeline builds](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m39s)

[let's see outline material design theme](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m43s)

[box field backing circle property](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m45s)

[plu](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m49s)

[menu so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h38m56s)

[minute but now i'm concerned](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m00s)

[where it found that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m05s)

[because now i'm worried there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m10s)

[misspellings somewhere](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m11s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m16s)

[those are all just plus](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m22s)

[okay that makes me feel better uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m29s)

[menu](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m32s)

[so let's do this i guess minus is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m36s)

[another one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m40s)

[just show me where that's used](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m42s)

[i don't know what it would have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m46s)

[like i said i'm more concerned with if](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m50s)

[there's typos in my code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m51s)

[than anything else not concerned with](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m54s)

[pack icon](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m56s)

[those ones if there's typos i'm not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h39m59s)

[fixing them because those are auto](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m01s)

[generated](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m02s)

[okay so i'm less concerned with that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m04s)

[that's cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m07s)

[uh sweet so short version](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m10s)

[the power toys or a cli](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m14s)

[sort of thingy](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m17s)

[code review methods changed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m22s)

[oh this is cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m31s)

[i don't have multiple things to do but](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m34s)

[if i had it checked out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m37s)

[twice](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m39s)

[it would do the diff for me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m42s)

[oh that is that is cool again my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m46s)

[my dream with this is to get effectively](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m50s)

[something that can](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m53s)

[i can use to automate away my](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h40m56s)

[uh hey](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m00s)

[um automate away code reviews](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m03s)

[okay is there anything else left in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m07s)

[i think i have pretty much gone through](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m11s)

[analyst layer](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m13s)

[list what was the air that it found](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m14s)

[oh the quality gate stuff right okay](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m18s)

[this is actually pretty cool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m21s)

[cool so i think that's probably most of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m25s)

[it and i don't doubt that i've probably](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m27s)

[missed a lot of it like i said my plan](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m29s)

[is to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m31s)

[keep using this on this library over the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m32s)

[course of several months](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m36s)

[because it is largely because i want to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m38s)

[a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m40s)

[get a better feel for this trend and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m41s)

[then b](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m44s)

[see if it actually helps improve](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m45s)

[the quality of code in here or if it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m48s)

[just added noise because it's a little](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m50s)

[hard to always say](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m51s)

[um yeah because it's nice seeing some of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m53s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m56s)

[change because obviously you change one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h41m58s)

[thing and break something else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m00s)

[excuse me more mountain dew more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m05s)

[mountain dew](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m07s)

[okay so final slash initial thoughts on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m11s)

[endopen um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m14s)

[one i think this is a a totally awesome](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m17s)

[tool i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m21s)

[i absolutely love uh the rules](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m22s)

[the other thing i didn't show um i came](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m27s)

[across it earlier this week](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m29s)

[you can go and write your own custom](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m30s)

[rules too so if there's something](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m32s)

[specific you want to flag on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m34s)

[you can do it and that's i i think the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m36s)

[thing that i'm most interested in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m38s)

[playing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m39s)

[on my plan is to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m40s)

[try and write some rules for some of the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m43s)

[common things that i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m46s)

[look for in code reviews and see how](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m49s)

[hard it is to do in here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m52s)

[the problem is i don't necessarily have](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m54s)

[any of those off the top of my head i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m55s)

[was going to wait until i just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m57s)

[saw something in a code review and go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h42m58s)

[yeah good enough for a practical test](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m00s)

[and roll with that because you can build](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m02s)

[you can build these things out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m05s)

[and and write more of these as you see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m06s)

[fit and then obviously put your own](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m09s)

[severity on them and all that kind of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m10s)

[jazz](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m12s)

[um it is a bit of a spendier tool i will](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m13s)

[say that they've got](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m16s)

[to do where is it uh buy and renew](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m17s)

[right so come on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m21s)

[so depending on the number uh i'm in the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m24s)

[u.s we'll do dollars right so depending](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m27s)

[on where you're at](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m29s)

[they do charge per number of seats and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m30s)

[then more importantly](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m32s)

[build machine seats too right so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m33s)

[consider that in in pricing it out right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m38s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m41s)

[devops tfs extension if you want to go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m42s)

[that route as well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m44s)

[right because you could then get the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m45s)

[power of this built in there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m47s)

[um i know robert had commented last week](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m49s)

[and i will](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m51s)

[i'll make a similar comment this is a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m52s)

[great tool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m55s)

[for identifying problems like a lot of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m56s)

[things in software development](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h43m59s)

[is it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m01s)

[i don't believe there will ever be a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m04s)

[perfect way to objectively](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m06s)

[quantify code i think tools like this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m08s)

[will do a great job of getting you close](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m12s)

[but i don't think you'll ever be able to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m15s)

[completely object um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m16s)

[objectively evaluate code and have these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m18s)

[things](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m21s)

[be correct right like this is the best](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m21s)

[guess of hey we think it'll take about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m23s)

[this long right it's important to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m25s)

[remember these are estimates not hard](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m27s)

[and fast rules](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m28s)

[and i would strongly discourage anyone](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m29s)

[from using these metrics to try and like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m32s)

[motivate developers to say oh well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m35s)

[you know you're you're the you've added](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m38s)

[five days worth of debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m41s)

[it really needs to be evaluated on a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m43s)

[case-by-case basis right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m44s)

[and occasionally it will be important to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m46s)

[say no we we're either a taking this on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m50s)

[as debt](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m53s)

[or b no the objective analysis is wrong](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m53s)

[in this case this you know because of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h44m57s)

[framework patterns whatever](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m00s)

[right this is the the correct way to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m01s)

[this the tool's wrong right that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m03s)

[like i said i don't think any tool like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m06s)

[this will ever be perfect but i think](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m07s)

[this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m09s)

[is um this is a pretty good step](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m09s)

[step forward in my mind for what i see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m13s)

[here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m15s)

[so um yeah i'm trying to think of what](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m17s)

[else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m21s)

[the i i think for me the biggest](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m22s)

[advantage is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m25s)

[this dashboard the rules the issues and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m26s)

[um the code review stuff the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m30s)

[uh going through and all there's and and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m34s)

[i say that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m37s)

[that you know the this dashboard there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m38s)

[a heck of a lot of features behind this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m41s)

[right like even just the uh where where](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m43s)

[did the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m46s)

[independent was the the options for the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m51s)

[that's all of the options there there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m51s)

[was project properties where did i find](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m53s)

[those](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m55s)

[oh independent project properties right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m56s)

[so even just](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h45m58s)

[all of the stuff and settings um for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m00s)

[everything inside of here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m03s)

[um there's a there's a lot to this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m05s)

[um a ton of it of stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m08s)

[and i would say um if anything it airs](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m12s)

[on having too much customization not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m15s)

[too little because you can tweak every](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m17s)

[little thing to your heart's content](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m20s)

[i know for one of the projects i ran it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m22s)

[on the the coding standards](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m24s)

[for the project for like naming](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m26s)

[conventions are different](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m28s)

[like the default settings here are sort](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m29s)

[of what you would expect with a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m31s)

[regular.net project](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m32s)

[their naming conventions were different](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m35s)

[so i went through and tweaked the rule](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m36s)

[and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m38s)

[it went from like an e rating to like a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m39s)

[b or something like that because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m41s)

[the vast majority of stuff it was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m43s)

[flagging was hey this doesn't conform to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m44s)

[conventions it's like well yeah but the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m46s)

[good default conventions that you hear](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m48s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m49s)

[but again then the really nice part is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m50s)

[everything's customizable](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m52s)

[and that cq link is fairly intuitive](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m53s)

[it works like link and you get an object](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h46m58s)

[model that makes](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m02s)

[a lot of sense so um i think](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m03s)

[yeah i let me look at my notes that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m06s)

[because i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m09s)

[i found a bunch of things that are like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m10s)

[are minor annoyances](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m14s)

[but i don't know if there's if there's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m17s)

[much other than that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m19s)

[that's really bothering me um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m21s)

[like i said overall the it it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m25s)

[targets i and i might need to check](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m28s)

[their website at least for the projects](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m30s)

[i'm on](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m32s)

[the stuff that interests me is it only](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m33s)

[goes against the c sharp](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m34s)

[it doesn't appear to really do relevant](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m36s)

[stuff against the xaml](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m38s)

[and i was going to see i was going to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m40s)

[look i think there was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m42s)

[there was something in here where i was](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m49s)

[looking at it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m52s)

[um potentially dead types right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m54s)

[so this one here and this is one of the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h47m57s)

[ones where i was like](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m00s)

[ah i it bothers me right like all of](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m02s)

[these converters](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m05s)

[right i can guarantee you these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m07s)

[converters are in use like for example](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m09s)

[this is dart converter right so copy](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m11s)

[paste we do just a straight text search](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m16s)

[i can tell you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m19s)

[right up this converter is being used by](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m20s)

[the xaml here](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m23s)

[and it's one of those i suspect the tool](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m24s)

[is just not smart enough to know](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m26s)

[oh this is a wpf you know theming](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m28s)

[library that's where that's coming from](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m30s)

[it isn't in fact missing so there is a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m33s)

[bit of it's like well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m36s)

[it would be nice if i picked it up i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m37s)

[understand why it doesn't right](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m39s)

[like a wpf libraries](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m40s)

[are not overly common compared to](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m45s)

[everything else](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m47s)

[and so do take some of that with a grain](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m48s)

[of salt especially if you have something](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m50s)

[that](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m52s)

[um where did i get was that under the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m53s)

[high list](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m56s)

[if you've got something that might be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h48m58s)

[consumed outside of your library](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m01s)

[um just just bear that in mind so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m04s)

[there there is a little bit of that um i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m07s)

[don't know](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m10s)

[the dead methods i might have to go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m11s)

[looking through](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m12s)

[because some of these might be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m14s)

[legitimately dead](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m16s)

[yeah like this one if this isn't being](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m20s)

[hit anywhere](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m22s)

[this might be worth just killing this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m23s)

[off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m26s)

[so i may go through and see about](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m27s)

[clearing out some of this dead code](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m29s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m31s)

[um and see where that gets me because](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m32s)

[some of these](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m35s)

[or like this one here i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m36s)

[yeah it's it's not realizing that this](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m40s)

[is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m43s)

[actually being consumed well](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m43s)

[let why didn't it flag the other ones me](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m46s)

[is this one actually dead](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m48s)

[now now i'm questioning how how sure i](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m51s)

[am of it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m54s)

[let's let's double check let's double](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m55s)

[check](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m58s)

[is this in fact so a it should be in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h49m59s)

[sample two](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m03s)

[because if it's not that's a that's a](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m05s)

[different problem](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m06s)

[uh yeah so it is there](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m09s)

[it's interesting that it didn't flag](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m12s)

[say this one and it missed](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m17s)

[that it was in fact used here i'm](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m20s)

[guessing maybe it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m22s)

[parsing the xaml and doing its best and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m24s)

[just failing](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m29s)

[yeah not sure why not sure why it would](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m33s)

[flag this one but not this one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m35s)

[uh best guess](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m38s)

[this is an attached one that one's not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m42s)

[so maybe that maybe that's the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m46s)

[difference is it's not handling the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m48s)

[one that's set with the attached](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m50s)

[property](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m51s)

[but it does properly identify that one](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m53s)

[interesting possible possible bug um](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h50m58s)

[yeah so overall i like it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m02s)

[i think it is well worth your time to go](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m06s)

[and consider it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m08s)

[um if you think that this might be](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m09s)

[oh and yeah generate html report not the](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m12s)

[one i wanted](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m15s)

[this one so if you think independ is](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m16s)

[something cool and you want to check it](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m19s)

[out there is the link](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m20s)

[have at it um again i i'm not making any](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m23s)

[commission off of this or anything](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m26s)

[um my only stake in it is they offered](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m28s)

[me a license to try it out](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m31s)

[evaluate it and give feedback on it so](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m33s)

[that is what i'm going to do](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m36s)

[so but yeah overall](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m38s)

[very solid very nice](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m41s)

[um and hopefully i'm i'm hoping to see](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m44s)

[some some benefits as it starts filling](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m48s)

[in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m51s)

[these ones here and i'm able to compare](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m52s)

[against my baseline a little bit more](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m54s)

[so i think with that i'm probably going](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m56s)

[to sign off for tonight](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h51m58s)

[thank you everyone for coming i know](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m00s)

[i've seen a whole bunch of chatter in](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m02s)

[the getter chat room and i've](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m03s)

[i have been swamped um i've had a bunch](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m06s)

[of family stuff going on and have not](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m08s)

[had a chance to get to it i do promise](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m10s)

[i'm not trying to ignore people it's](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m12s)

[just my life has gotten very busy](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m13s)

[and i only have so many hours in a day](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m16s)

[and](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m18s)

[sleep has to occupy some of them](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m19s)

[so with that i'm going to sign off](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m22s)

[say happy coding thank you everyone for](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m25s)

[coming talk to you later](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h52m27s)

[you](https://youtu.be/HY8Ld3itEwo?t=01h55m40s)
