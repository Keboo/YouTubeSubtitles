[Microsoft Build is coming up um this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m41s)

[Microsoft's uh one of their two big](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m45s)

[conferences every year build and Ignite](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m48s)

[are their their big exciting ones um and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m50s)

[we can see here not shockingly that uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m53s)

[AI co-pilot and everything is going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m56s)

[be uh prime feature right uh all the way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h00m58s)

[through here of all of the cool stuff um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m02s)

[for build it's a little more developer](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m05s)

[focused whereas Ignite is a little more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m07s)

[we'll call it infrastructure ops IT kind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m09s)

[of related stuff but again those lines](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m12s)

[are real blurry so it's like there's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m15s)

[you get you're going to get a little bit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m17s)

[of that at both um and because Microsoft](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m18s)

[is on a huge AI kick in case you haven't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m21s)

[heard AI is a thing um that will uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m23s)

[definitely be a central uh topic](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m26s)

[especially since you know it made it all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m29s)

[the way into the top so at a minimum so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h01m30s)

[historical lens my plan is to start at C](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h02m59s)

[one literally the beginning and run all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m02s)

[the way up to C# 14 the one that is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m04s)

[expected to release in November so it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m06s)

[going to be you know when we get to that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m08s)

[one it's going to be here's what's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m09s)

[probably going to to land because C#'s](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m11s)

[open source and we can kind of guess and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m13s)

[see what's there but you know you're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m16s)

[never 100% sure until it actually ships](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m17s)

[but um just kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m20s)

[exploring how we got to where we're at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m22s)

[kind of the evolution of C# like people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m24s)

[get really hot and excited about the new](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m26s)

[upcoming languages and how exciting they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m29s)

[are and that and there is something to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m31s)

[be said about modern languages built](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m33s)

[with um kind of modern stacks and those](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m35s)

[types of things in mind but C is very](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m38s)

[well battle tested over the years it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m41s)

[kind of the premier language if you're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m44s)

[and we've got you know your Rust your Go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m54s)

[the kind of the new hip languages but in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h03m56s)

[my opinion C is pretty good and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m00s)

[especially with all of the the features](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m02s)

[and kind of understanding how we got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m04s)

[there because some features they're real](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m05s)

[popular then they Wayne and they come](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m08s)

[back and so it'll be an exciting one i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m09s)

[am really looking forward to this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m12s)

[this as a jump start for software](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m39s)

[development using GitHub copilot so it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m42s)

[going to be uh a lot of understanding](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m45s)

[how to use it best code spaces being](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m48s)

[able to build hands-on labs um all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h04m51s)

[we were working on uh partner coupon so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m13s)

[brief primer velopac free open-source](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m17s)

[SDK and tooling gives you an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m20s)

[installer update framework you can build](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m23s)

[and distribute your desktops apps it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m25s)

[awesome it's wonderful cross language](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m27s)

[crossplatform hurrah right um however](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m30s)

[free open source uh the I was talking to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m34s)

[some other developers and they and their](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m37s)

[first question to me was how are you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m39s)

[going to make money on it uh not that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m41s)

[they didn't think Velopac was awesome](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m43s)

[but they were worried about the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m45s)

[sustainability of it i was like ah we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m47s)

[have an answer for that so uh we have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m49s)

[been building a SAS hosting solution](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m51s)

[because the tooling will build you the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m53s)

[installer and it's got some upload](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m55s)

[commands to kind of put the installers](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m57s)

[up at different places but at that point](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h05m59s)

[we kind of go hands off and go you know](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m01s)

[what the the hosting of this and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m03s)

[managing of that that's all on you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m04s)

[we're going to own but for people who](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m08s)

[want us to own it and say I just want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m11s)

[build my app i don't want to think about](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m14s)

[hosting i just want it to ship and go we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m16s)

[are building a SAS hosting solution and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m19s)

[part of that is uh we've got some people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m21s)

[who are interested in partnering with us](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m23s)

[and we want our partners to be able to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m25s)

[offer coupons to their customers when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m27s)

[they buy things so that's what we're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m29s)

[building the ability for a partner to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m32s)

[come to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m35s)

[Velopac to generate a coupon that the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m35s)

[partner can give to the partner's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m38s)

[customer and then that customer can come](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m40s)

[to Velopac sign up for our hosted](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m42s)

[solution and use the coupon for some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m44s)

[discount right that's the game plan so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m46s)

[what have we done what have we done uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m50s)

[we did a bunch of stuff so last time we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m52s)

[kind of kicked off building out uh this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m56s)

[admin API and this partner API right so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h06m58s)

[these two projects here is what we were](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m01s)

[starting to build the admin API meaning](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m04s)

[this is what people like me people who](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m06s)

[work at Velopat get to use to create](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m09s)

[partners create uh the partner coupons](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m11s)

[and then the partner API the thing that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m14s)

[the partner gets to call that they then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m16s)

[get to go through and uh get the the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m18s)

[code back so that is where we that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m21s)

[where we are set up we've got full](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m24s)

[integration test all of those things are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m27s)

[working um if we pull](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m28s)

[up so um this whole thing is built with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m31s)

[Net Aspire like this is gold right ju](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m40s)

[just this dashboard and having all of my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m45s)

[stuff in one place and being able to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m47s)

[restart services and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m49s)

[that alone is gold right so I've got a a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m51s)

[database I've got Azure running locally](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m54s)

[because I have Docker um running off on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m56s)

[another screen here and that's what's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h07m59s)

[hosting my SQL server and my blob](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m00s)

[storage i do not have persistence set up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m03s)

[so but I do have the container lifetime](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m06s)

[staying up so the the database stays up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m09s)

[as long as I keep the container running](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m12s)

[but then anytime I want to effectively](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m14s)

[clear my database I just kick the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m15s)

[container and that's kind like right now](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m17s)

[I'm kind of happy at that level right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m20s)

[like I could configure it to have a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m23s)

[persistent store so it lives so the the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m24s)

[database outlives the container's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m26s)

[lifetime but I'm like I don't know for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m28s)

[local dev this feels nice it feels nice](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m30s)

[being able to go into a clean state](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m32s)

[whenever I want so um yeah we're rolling](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m34s)

[with that for the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m38s)

[moment the yeah so we come down here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m39s)

[we've got this admin API and I am going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m43s)

[to open up the admin API](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m46s)

[uh as a different browser profile oh I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m49s)

[already got it up and the reason is is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m50s)

[because the admin API is like each of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m52s)

[these APIs have a different level of off](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m56s)

[right so the admin API is locked down to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h08m59s)

[a security group in my Azure tenant for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m02s)

[Vellopac so that only people in my admin](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m06s)

[security group can hit it right kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m08s)

[makes sense uh and right now it's just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m11s)

[me and my partner that's it we are the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m14s)

[admins we are the only ones who get to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m15s)

[hit this API uh but like for example I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m17s)

[can hit partner list because I've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m20s)

[already authorized myself we got no](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m21s)

[partners right so let's let's actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m24s)

[walk through what we've built so far so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m25s)

[we need to make a partner so we'll come](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m27s)

[in here and we'll create and we will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m29s)

[call this I don't know test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m30s)

[partner](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m33s)

[test partner great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m36s)

[boom okay now couple things no one panic](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m39s)

[yes is this an API key it is but this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m43s)

[API key lives in my local database on my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m47s)

[local system not real that not concerned](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m50s)

[right so as soon as I kick my database A](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m53s)

[this is going to get cycled uh and B you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m55s)

[have to be on my system to make use of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m57s)

[it so yeah we can we can get away with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h09m59s)

[this kind of stuff so but first of all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m02s)

[I'm going to copy this because I'm going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m04s)

[to need this later and actually let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m06s)

[just let's do the the time- tested thing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m09s)

[of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m13s)

[uh Oh yeah that was just me playing with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m15s)

[math um we're going to just put it here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m17s)

[because we might need this and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m20s)

[we're going to grab our partner ID](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m22s)

[because we're going to need that too](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m24s)

[because as everyone knows Notepad is the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m26s)

[developer](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m29s)

[clipboard yes I have multi- clipboard](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m30s)

[turned on as well all right so we got we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m32s)

[got a partner huzzah right if we go back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m34s)

[and list it right we can see test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m36s)

[partner huzzah great uh now we need to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m39s)

[create a uh a coupon code for this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m42s)

[partner to be able to go through and use](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m45s)

[and this coupon code requires](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m47s)

[using Stripe so let me get window over](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m50s)

[here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m54s)

[and let me get logged in appropriately](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m56s)

[and into my test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h10m58s)

[environment again we can pow-wow here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m00s)

[because we can play in test and it's not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m03s)

[something I'm worried about anybody](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m06s)

[exploiting great okay so I've got a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m07s)

[uh my test sandbox for Velopac stood up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m12s)

[got my product catalog please ignore the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m16s)

[pricing pricing TBD uh but we've got a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h11m18s)

[part where things get fun so we come](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m03s)

[back over here and we go okay we've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m05s)

[we've simulated and done the work of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m07s)

[admin now let's simulate being the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m09s)

[partner right so we're going to come](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m11s)

[over here and I'm going to launch the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m13s)

[partner and you'll know I'm in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m15s)

[different browser profile just for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m16s)

[sanity and for this I'm going to need to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m18s)

[enter an API key well conveniently we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m21s)

[put that right here now some of you may](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m24s)

[very astutely note something here in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m27s)

[second right so we off but this doesn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m28s)

[really do much it just caches the value](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m33s)

[we gave it um and then we come in here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m34s)

[and then we got to give it a coupon ID](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m38s)

[now I want to this I spent a great deal](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m40s)

[of time working on this so I feel the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m42s)

[urge to show it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m44s)

[off cuz this this made my head hurt and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m45s)

[if people know an easier way I would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m48s)

[love absolutely love to hear it so I did](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m50s)

[some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m54s)

[stuff i want Well for starters I bang my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m55s)

[head against a wall repeatedly because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h12m59s)

[Swagger UI has gone through several](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m02s)

[revisions and unfortunately for me what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m04s)

[that meant is I had to dig through a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m07s)

[swath of online information that was a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m09s)

[mixture of different versions and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m12s)

[there's been like uh uh trying to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m14s)

[remember there's like N swag and a few](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m17s)

[other people who have built really like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m20s)

[similar things and oh dear heavens it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m22s)

[was a nightmare to try to find something](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m25s)

[that worked but here's what we know](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m26s)

[right you'll note I've got some debug](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m29s)

[statements in here for the moment but if](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m31s)

[we go elements right so in this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m32s)

[particular case I've got this script](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m35s)

[here right uh and or I should say not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m38s)

[yeah this one's not mine this is the one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m43s)

[the swagger UI generates and so I went](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m46s)

[okay I'm taking this right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m48s)

[and because you'll note this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m52s)

[registering up on the window onload](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m54s)

[function because frankly I couldn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m55s)

[figure out how to not have it do this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h13m57s)

[and so I gave up on it but I did find](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m00s)

[where I could inject my own script](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m03s)

[blocks up in the head and I went you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m05s)

[know what we're going we're going with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m06s)

[it so you'll note I had to include this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m09s)

[crypto library so I brought that in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m11s)

[we'll explain why in a minute and you'll](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m14s)

[note I have a set interval where I watch](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m16s)

[for the window UI property to get set](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m18s)

[effectively using this to know when the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m21s)

[other call has completed because the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m24s)

[last thing this other one does over](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m27s)

[here right is it the last thing it does](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m29s)

[is set window UI so I just wait for that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m32s)

[like you know what good enough so set](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m35s)

[interval blah blah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m37s)

[blah spin rinse repeat blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m39s)

[blah blah we're off we're off to the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m42s)

[races right clear the interval and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m43s)

[the top part of this code it it or I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m47s)

[should say most of this code setup is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m49s)

[literally copied and pasted from that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m51s)

[other function because I wanted to build](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m53s)

[a new swagger UI bundle um and I could](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m54s)

[not figure out how else to set this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h14m59s)

[request interceptor because this exists](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m01s)

[on the config that you pass into Swagger](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m04s)

[UI bundle it does not exist on the UI as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m06s)

[far as far as I could tell cuz I think](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m09s)

[you have to reconfigure the Swagger UI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m12s)

[and I couldn't find a way to reconfigure](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m15s)

[Swagger UI bundle and just add this none](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m16s)

[of the samples I found worked um and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m21s)

[digging through the docs and kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m24s)

[going through their code this is what I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m25s)

[came to the conclusion of again if](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m27s)

[people have a better solution I am all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m29s)

[ears and the only reason for doing this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m31s)

[is because I like using the swagger UI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m33s)

[as a way of testing right i wrote um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m36s)

[tests and I'll show those to you but I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m40s)

[wanted a a effectively a JavaScripty](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m42s)

[answer as well so you'll know what it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m45s)

[does is it uh requests the uh it sets up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m48s)

[an interceptor on the request outbound](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m52s)

[from the swagger UI and it watches for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m54s)

[that off header because you'll remember](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m57s)

[we just pasted this in and I will have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h15m58s)

[you note this colon here right that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m03s)

[important we'll come back to it in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m06s)

[minute it waits for this it splits on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m07s)

[that colon all right and then inside of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m11s)

[here uh it splits it up because the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m13s)

[first part is the the ID and the second](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m16s)

[part is actually the the secret so the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m19s)

[big idea here is something called HMAC](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m23s)

[encryption](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m25s)

[so when you like we could have just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m27s)

[generated a random API key given it to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m30s)

[the partners and said set this API key](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m33s)

[as your header right and that will give](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m34s)

[you off we could have done that that is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m36s)

[simple i don't like that um and I don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m39s)

[like it for a couple reasons one if](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m42s)

[somebody ever intercepts that traffic](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m44s)

[midflow they can just replay it as much](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m46s)

[as they want that bothered me i don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m48s)

[like that um I I wanted some idea of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m51s)

[when this thing was going to be there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m56s)

[with HMAC when you hand them the key the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h16m58s)

[key is never is never sent on the wire](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m01s)

[what the key does is it is uh it sort of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m04s)

[works the way HTTPS does where you have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m07s)

[an asymmetric encryption there's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m09s)

[public key and a private key um and so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m11s)

[the secret key is functionally the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m13s)

[private key and so what will happen is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m16s)

[this will sign a signature that signed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m20s)

[signature gets sent to the server the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m24s)

[server unpacks it also signs with the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m26s)

[private key and then checks and says](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m29s)

["Okay do these match?" And if the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m31s)

[signatures don't match it goes "Nope](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m34s)

[this wasn't signed with the same private](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m36s)

[key that the partner was given must not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m37s)

[have come from them right it also has](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m39s)

[this nons thing where it um if it sees](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m42s)

[the same request multiple times it goes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m44s)

[nah n I'm not taking that so there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m46s)

[there's a lot of bits in there that make](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m48s)

[it a little bit more secure right so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m50s)

[anyway log it out we generate a non a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m53s)

[non does not matter what it is it just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m56s)

[needs to be unique couldn't care less](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h17m58s)

[what it is needs to be non- empty and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m01s)

[unique and then we need a time stamp and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m04s)

[then this here is that signature that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m07s)

[we're building up right so the hashed ID](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m09s)

[is effectively the partner's ID it's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m12s)

[way for us to identify who this thing is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m15s)

[and then we go through and we hash up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m17s)

[the HTTP method the full URL that we're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m19s)

[going to the timestamp and the knots](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m23s)

[right all of those things come together](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m26s)

[to be one some people will also include](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m28s)

[like the request body or similar in this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m30s)

[case it's a little overkill it's like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m33s)

[this is probably good enough right and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m34s)

[then the the big thing here is you we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m37s)

[base 64 encode our secret to get the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m40s)

[bytes because that's what the cryptojs](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m42s)

[wants and then we sign](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m43s)

[um this so this signature here gets](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m47s)

[signed with those secretes the key part](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m50s)

[here this secret key never gets sent on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m52s)

[the wire it's so anyone intercepting it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m54s)

[will never see this right it could be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m57s)

[compromised in other ways but it won't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h18m59s)

[be compromised by someone sniffing right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m00s)

[right so we get back the H hmac bytes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m03s)

[build it up and then we send this HMAC](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m05s)

[header which then will get read by the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m08s)

[server it will unpack this thing it also](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m11s)

[has the secret key so it can go through](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m15s)

[and validate that yes this thing was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m17s)

[signed appropriately that's the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m19s)

[idea okay so that gets sent on the wire](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m23s)

[bippity boppity booya bob's your uncle](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m27s)

[now what we'd like to do is test to see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m30s)

[if this thing actually works because I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m33s)

[haven't actually tested this beyond](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m34s)

[making sure the O worked i got through](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m35s)

[the off and I went "Yay going to bed."](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m37s)

[Because it was like 2](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m40s)

[a.m and I banged my head against this i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m43s)

[was getting ready to scrap it and all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m46s)

[this just so that I can have Swagger UI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m48s)

[effectively be my front end for this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m52s)

[API right so we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m55s)

[coupon code we've authorized with our](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h19m58s)

[thing we hit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m00s)

[execute we think for a moment we we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m03s)

[naturally crash uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m06s)

[my Stripe API key](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m09s)

[is not set and so then it blows up and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m12s)

[it dies okay this will be fun uh because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m16s)

[we're going to try to do this without me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m20s)

[accidentally exposing my Stripe key so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m21s)

[that'll be that'll be exciting the good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m24s)

[news is if I expose it it's only the one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m26s)

[for my test environment but I will be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m28s)

[cycling it if that happens so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m29s)

[uh let's take a look at a few things so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m33s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m35s)

[one I thought I had already set it up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m36s)

[but apparently not so I So Stripe stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m38s)

[you you set it up with a static um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m42s)

[static call here so API key equals blah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m46s)

[blah blah but I've got these Stripe](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m48s)

[options](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m50s)

[and these stripe options I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m53s)

[thought were registered through some of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m56s)

[my default Velopac services so I have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h20m59s)

[this Velopac service defaults so if you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m01s)

[do go through net Aspire one of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m04s)

[things it will do is it will generate](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m06s)

[you I think it calls it like a service](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m08s)

[defaults project um and it's worth](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m10s)

[noting it genens that but then it kind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m14s)

[of goes hands off and says that's your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m16s)

[code you do what you want with it i took](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m18s)

[that and I'm like nah um and I threw it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m20s)

[inside this service core because I put a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m23s)

[lot more in here than just my service](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m25s)

[defaults like this is I've got three](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m26s)

[services multiple background jobs like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m28s)

[and they all need to share some stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m32s)

[like database models and all well I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m35s)

[guess database models live up here but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m37s)

[there's a whole bunch of extra stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m39s)

[that they go with and I just dumped it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m41s)

[all in here um yes some of these things](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m43s)

[are only used by a couple of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m45s)

[services and not all of them but Yagy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m46s)

[right we are it's the minimal amount](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m49s)

[needed to get this thing up and rolling](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m52s)

[so but the service collection or uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m55s)

[service defaults gets registered here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h21m57s)

[add Velopax services is invoked](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m00s)

[here add](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m03s)

[stripe oh that did](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m06s)

[not Oh wait hold on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m09s)

[okay so one I put it in this add](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m15s)

[payments method and then never invoke](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m17s)

[the add payments method so that's dumb](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m19s)

[to begin with uh and then more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m21s)

[importantly I already have an add stripe](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m23s)

[method so I should probably just put it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m25s)

[in there cuz that would make a little](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m27s)

[bit more sense oh and this has a memory](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m29s)

[cache built into](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m32s)

[it okay whoa](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m35s)

[okay I've got a weird thing going where](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m41s)

[I've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m43s)

[got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m44s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m48s)

[void because we aren't using it like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m50s)

[that i am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m53s)

[curious why I have distributed cache and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m56s)

[memory cache being added we're going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h22m59s)

[take a brief detour and figure that out](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m01s)

[because this is immemory cache isn't it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m03s)

[yeah so where am I using IM memory cache](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m06s)

[memory cache](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m14s)

[here what are you being used](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m18s)

[for oh getting the plan](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m21s)

[IDs](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m25s)

[interesting okay well that's registered](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m28s)

[in the right place at least i don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m31s)

[fully like that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m33s)

[uh move](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m41s)

[to distributed cache so I am doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m43s)

[something kind of weird right like I am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m46s)

[adding in um an I distributed cache but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m48s)

[I have this note in here that even](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m51s)

[though I'm registering a distributed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m54s)

[cache it's technically only an in-memory](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m56s)

[one so it doesn't actually uh go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h23m58s)

[anywhere hey Izzy no problem and hey if](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m02s)

[you if you have questions on any of that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m05s)

[let me know and we can we can dive in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m07s)

[further](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m10s)

[um yeah if anybody's curious Izzy has a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m12s)

[question the material design discord](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m15s)

[channel about stuff so yeah if you got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m17s)

[any questions on it let me know and we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m22s)

[can always take a look at it okay so I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m23s)

[think my issue was I had registered my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m26s)

[options](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m28s)

[and they I just never invoked my method](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m30s)

[because this should go through and do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m35s)

[it yeah and this post configure is only](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m37s)

[here to support my local Azure setup or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m41s)

[my local](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m43s)

[um Aspire](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m44s)

[setup](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m51s)

[okay uh let's see what do you mean by](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m56s)

[that comment about replay attack oh yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h24m59s)

[yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m01s)

[so the the idea here with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m03s)

[um this one so uh let me go and open](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m07s)

[up so this is a basic because I use um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m13s)

[HMAC for um a couple different places](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m17s)

[because we have API keys that this um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m20s)

[the Velopac uh CLI tool will use](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m23s)

[um terrible PLC project yeah um but what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m27s)

[is important](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m32s)

[is this guy here so this is effectively](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m33s)

[the um the backend code that gets called](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m37s)

[when there is an authorization header](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m41s)

[that gets passed that has that HMAC off](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m43s)

[um at the beginning so this is where it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m46s)

[pulls it apart it gets all of these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m48s)

[values out and this is where that that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m50s)

[nons value comes from so the idea with a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m52s)

[replay attack if you could imagine](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m55s)

[something in like either your dev tools](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m57s)

[or fiddler or Postman effectively](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h25m59s)

[somebody's able to hit send twice in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m01s)

[row on the request and have it do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m04s)

[something the the idea with a non is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m06s)

[it's supposed to be a unique value it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m08s)

[forces the caller to generate something](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m10s)

[new um on each of their requests so that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m13s)

[you can't just hit the button twice it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m17s)

[kind of like having a rolling code a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m18s)

[little bit um not quite equivalent but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m20s)

[conceptually of this idea that the same](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m25s)

[code once used can't be reused a second](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m27s)

[time and so this this replay idea down](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m30s)

[here um all this ends up doing is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m33s)

[looking off in that I distributed cache](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m36s)

[to say hey have I seen this non before](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m38s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m41s)

[the there's a allowed clock drift for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m44s)

[the time stamp because we include both](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m47s)

[this nons which is a unique value random](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m48s)

[unique value doesn't matter what it is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m51s)

[and then a time stamp and we've got some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m53s)

[allowances for time stamps to drift and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m56s)

[clock drift and that kind of thing And](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h26m58s)

[so we we store the nonses that we've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m00s)

[seen for double the um the drift that we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m02s)

[allow there's uh some rules in kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m07s)

[like sampling and number theory around](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m10s)

[uh needing to do things twice as uh much](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m13s)

[as the accuracy that you want right so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m16s)

[if you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m19s)

[uh yeah I think I said that right i'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m21s)

[hoping I did i'm I'm trying to run it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m24s)

[through in my head see if I said it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m25s)

[backwards but in this case we we we cash](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m26s)

[the knots for twice our time drift](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m30s)

[because we know it won't fall back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m31s)

[um yeah and everything everything here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m34s)

[is UTC uh I because I'm basically](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m37s)

[running the clients here um I can force](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m40s)

[it in all cases right get UTC now is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m44s)

[every single one of these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m48s)

[the reason for my comment here about how](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m51s)

[this doesn't actually completely work is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m54s)

[when I deploy out my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h27m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m03s)

[service let's see we'll go here right so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m05s)

[if we just pick on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m08s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m12s)

[uh do I have it here i don't have it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m15s)

[here container app service](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m16s)

[uh what container app i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m23s)

[remember where this is um I have my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m25s)

[container app set to scale and the the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m28s)

[the issue is my container apps will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m31s)

[scale up to multiple](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m33s)

[instances um and so when you do a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m35s)

[distributed cache the idea is you should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m38s)

[have one cache and uh multiple instances](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m40s)

[of your service but this is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m45s)

[distributed memory cache which the only](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m47s)

[reason this thing even exists is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m49s)

[typically for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m52s)

[testing and so at some point I'm going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m54s)

[to swap this out and probably plug in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m57s)

[SQL or Reddus behind it so that I have a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h28m59s)

[common back plane to support this cache](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m02s)

[from but right now if somebody wanted to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m04s)

[Yeah yeah distributed in that single](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m07s)

[instance so yes so distributed memory](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m09s)

[cache in this case is an oxymoron is it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m12s)

[really isn't there and it's this whole](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m15s)

[memory distributed cache is mostly uh an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m18s)

[implementation provided by Microsoft](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m21s)

[largely to support testing right should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m24s)

[only be used in single server scenarios](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m27s)

[as this cache stores items in memory and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m29s)

[doesn't expand across multiple machines](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m31s)

[or you know in my case docker containers](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m34s)

[so if this thing horizontally scales](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m38s)

[which it does very aggressively um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m41s)

[technically somebody could could replay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m45s)

[the attack until up to the number of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m47s)

[instances that I scale up to which I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m50s)

[think I'm somewhere between like five](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m52s)

[and 10 so it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m53s)

[like yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m55s)

[eh I'm not going to stress about it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h29m58s)

[right now again not a problem I have at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m00s)

[the moment um right now the risk factor](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m03s)

[is very very low](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m06s)

[so and the worst case scenario is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m08s)

[somebody gets a few extra](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m10s)

[um coupon codes assuming they compromise](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m14s)

[a request in flight and are able to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m17s)

[replay it up to the number of instances](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m19s)

[I have before it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m21s)

[scales it just feels](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m23s)

[so like I the the risk the amount to fix](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m26s)

[is going to be swapping out for a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m31s)

[different provider i just have to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m33s)

[configure one yeah you need a clustered](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m35s)

[storage backend cache yeah and that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m37s)

[why like um it's not hard to plug it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m39s)

[like it's literally going to be a one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m43s)

[method call to swap out for either um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m44s)

[SQL or Reddus behind the scenes yeah SQL](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m47s)

[distributed cache is an option the only](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m50s)

[uh the only thing that is slowing me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m53s)

[down on doing that is on this project I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m56s)

[I have terraformed all of my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h30m59s)

[infrastructure and I refuse to use any](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m01s)

[infrastructure that I haven't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m03s)

[terraformed deployed so I just I just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m04s)

[need to do it so this got me up and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m08s)

[working and it'll suff it'll suffice for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m11s)

[now because this is still even on a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m14s)

[branch this hasn't even merged into my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m15s)

[dev branch yet so it'll get there that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m17s)

[why it's that's why it's a it's a fix](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m21s)

[this and clean it up in a minute because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m24s)

[the risk factor is low and I just need](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m27s)

[to deploy some infrastructure to support](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m29s)

[it and then we're off to the races](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m31s)

[because I think SQL is probably the way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m32s)

[I'm going to go just because the like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m34s)

[some of the Reddit stuff in Azure is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m37s)

[little spendier it's like gh I don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m38s)

[need it that much and this API is not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m42s)

[going to be hit that much](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m44s)

[why not Tofus and Terraform like so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m48s)

[yesterday but I know Terraform Izzy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m50s)

[that's the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m52s)

[thing i think Bicep would be my next one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m54s)

[or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h31m58s)

[Palumi both of those both of those hold](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m00s)

[a great deal of interest for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m03s)

[me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m05s)

[um yeah Palumi if I want to do something](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m07s)

[a little more crossplat stuff uh bicep](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m09s)

[because it's Microsoft and looks kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m12s)

[cool like Terraform terraform used to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m15s)

[the you know the the nice cross-platform](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m18s)

[option and it still is like it make no](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m20s)

[mistake Hashi Corp did a good job um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m22s)

[their their licensing thing kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m26s)

[annoyed some people when they did it but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m28s)

[it was like h it's less of a big deal](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m29s)

[unless you're a big unless you're making](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m32s)

[lots of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m34s)

[money it's like using scripts when you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m35s)

[could use](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m38s)

[Anible i'm not saying you're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m39s)

[wrong uh okay so I think at this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m43s)

[point did I relaunch no where's this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m47s)

[thing running](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m52s)

[at hey look it's over here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m53s)

[okay i'm going to relaunch because I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m57s)

[don't remember if that has the config](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h32m59s)

[change because I think this thing should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m02s)

[now](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m03s)

[work i think it should work](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m04s)

[uh and I have my swagger pages cashing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m08s)

[my O which is a blessing and a curse](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m10s)

[because I think most of them time out in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m13s)

[like an hour so it's really convenient](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m15s)

[when you're relaunching it's really](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m18s)

[annoying at that hour mark when all of a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m19s)

[sudden you start getting 401's uh so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m20s)

[let's see partner](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m22s)

[API still authorized](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m24s)

[great uh we need our coupon code that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m27s)

[thing and then we hit execute and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m32s)

[hopefully it worked it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m42s)

[worked wish I could still use vault uk](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m52s)

[government has more pennies to burn than](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m55s)

[I do i totally understand Izzy i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h33m56s)

[completely understand okay i think](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m00s)

[though I think that means if I look at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m02s)

[my coupon I should have a product code](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m05s)

[in here like when I hit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m07s)

[refresh come](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m11s)

[on and again I'm okay showing this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m14s)

[environment for Stripe because uh this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m16s)

[isn't this is plugged to my local](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m19s)

[environment nothing in that's actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m21s)

[out in the world oh look at that it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m22s)

[worked it generated a promotion](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m24s)

[code yay yay that makes me so happy that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m27s)

[makes me so so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m32s)

[happy there's the promotion code and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m35s)

[then I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m39s)

[think let's see if we can redeem it i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m41s)

[think we can redeem it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m44s)

[now i mean that's that's the whole point](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m47s)

[of generating these promotion codes let](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m49s)

[let let's keep going okay so where's my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m51s)

[front](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h34m53s)

[as annoying as my EV's lane control](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m29s)

[which insists on either emergency](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m32s)

[braking or driving me into a pedestrian](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m34s)

[when it gets scared by a truck in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m36s)

[other lane yeah yeah see that's the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m38s)

[thing is and that's where I I really](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m41s)

[have to lean on the idea of I like Yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m44s)

[this is this is what I want i just have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m48s)

[the diff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m51s)

[backwards i like when it's the co-pilot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m52s)

[model and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m56s)

[it its purpose is to assist me and make](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h47m57s)

[me faster or better like I like that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m00s)

[like I don't mind it generating those](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m03s)

[summaries per file i just wish it put it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m05s)

[at the point where me as the human wants](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m07s)

[to see it like it's useful information](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m09s)

[put it where I want it now please don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m12s)

[be an obnoxious person like be helpful](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m14s)

[um like that kind of thing i'm I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m19s)

[totally cool with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m22s)

[uh let's see here i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m25s)

[uh let me let me go back i want to check](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m29s)

[the test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m32s)

[explorer uh let's see and then this one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m33s)

[here is the other](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m36s)

[one but yeah it's it's it's definitely](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m40s)

[one of those areas where I I see it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m42s)

[being somewhat problematic okay and this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m44s)

[was because I broke it up so for people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m47s)

[who watched last week initially partner](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m49s)

[and coupon were all just one big object](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m52s)

[and I finally got annoyed with myself](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m54s)

[and realized that was stupid and I broke](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m56s)

[them into two objects](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h48m58s)

[like once I thought about I'm like I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m01s)

[they really should be two separate](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m02s)

[things so this is just adding the CRUD](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m04s)

[for that okay those are fine and even](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m07s)

[though it's flagging me right now it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m12s)

[not like this API is released](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m14s)

[so like yes it's a breaking change but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m16s)

[it's a breaking change for a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m20s)

[non-released API so frankly until you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m22s)

[release](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m26s)

[it totally fine](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m27s)

[okay and then we'll just run this to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m30s)

[clean it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m32s)

[up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m33s)

[yeah yeah ai overlords work out how to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m38s)

[how to modify get history yeah and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m40s)

[that's the thing is it's like I want I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m42s)

[don't mind the AI help and frankly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m44s)

[there's some there's some cool stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m46s)

[like the Jet Brands Writer it's got a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m48s)

[really cool three-way merge tool like as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m53s)

[a Git Kraken fan I'm a little jealous of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m56s)

[Ryder's merge tool because Ryder can](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h49m58s)

[cheat because Ryder's a full IDE it has](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m01s)

[language semantics available to it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m04s)

[whereas most Git tools are doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m06s)

[textbased comparisons so Ryder's merge](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m08s)

[tool is actually slightly more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m11s)

[intelligent because it knows oh right it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m13s)

[makes more sense if this is a method](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m16s)

[move or something of that nature right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m18s)

[so because it can group things by blocks](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m19s)

[rather than just textbased and so it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m21s)

[does a more intelligent merge it's just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m24s)

[like man I really want that in more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m25s)

[tools but I totally realize what I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m28s)

[asking for is like forget Kraken to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m29s)

[that they would have to have a language](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m32s)

[model available to them and by language](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m34s)

[model I'm not talking LLM but like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m37s)

[something that generates a syntax tree](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m39s)

[so that they would have some concept of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m42s)

[this bit of text is a method this bit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m44s)

[isn't right like those types of things](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m46s)

[you can't do when you don't have that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m48s)

[but if you're a full IDE you absolutely](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m50s)

[have that so it's like ah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m52s)

[um but I definitely would not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m56s)

[mind like AI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h50m58s)

[suggestions for merge conflicts i do not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m01s)

[trust it to do the merge](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m05s)

[correctly and frankly I don't need it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m08s)

[making a more tangled mess i'm good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m10s)

[enough at that all by myself i don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m12s)

[need help uh let's see so using](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m14s)

[removal update test update test autogen](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m18s)

[um don't like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m29s)

[that at some point I so for people who](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m32s)

[haven't seen this this is worth noting](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m35s)

[like get Kraken's new AI stuff is new](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m38s)

[just to be clear I think I think April's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m41s)

[release was the first one was the first](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m44s)

[one that had it um and so expect more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m46s)

[but they do have this get Kraken AI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m51s)

[tools down here where you can put in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m54s)

[custom instructions to tell it what to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m57s)

[do um I think I like this one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h51m59s)

[b um at some point like I've requested a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m05s)

[whole slew of features for the AI stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m08s)

[the one really cool thing is if you want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m10s)

[to bring your own API key you can right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m13s)

[and you can point it at um Anthropic or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m15s)

[OpenAI but if you don't have uh your own](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m19s)

[OpenAI or Anthropic account you can just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m23s)

[go through um their API and so if you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m26s)

[are on a paid subscription you get an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m30s)

[aotment of tokens per week which is kind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m31s)

[of nice that it's per week because when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m34s)

[it's per month if you burn them all up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m36s)

[in week one you just like oh I guess I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m37s)

[done for the rest of the month but if](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m39s)

[it's like per week it's like yeah let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m41s)

[use them like they're going to reset on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m43s)

[Saturday they reset sunday I don't know](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m46s)

[it's sometime around the middle of or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m47s)

[the end of the week that they they reset](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m50s)

[it's like oh cool actually hey there we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h52m52s)

[Saturday yeah so I've always used Beyond](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m03s)

[Compare but was looking at semantic](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m05s)

[merge tool several years ago which did](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m08s)

[something similar yeah and I will say](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m09s)

[for really ugly merges a good tool like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m12s)

[that is kind of nice it is very nice um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m17s)

[the one thing I will say that Git Kraken](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m22s)

[does this preemptive um conflict](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m24s)

[detector kind of guards you against the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m28s)

[ugly merges the only thing it doesn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m31s)

[because it gives you at least good heads](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m33s)

[up to oh if you're because if you're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m35s)

[constantly rebasing it's and people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m37s)

[aren't doing like major like big commits](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m39s)

[all the time and sh you know coming to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m42s)

[the table three days later of I did all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m44s)

[these changes right like this is fairly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m45s)

[nice to be able to warn you of that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m47s)

[ahead of time um but there are times](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m49s)

[where it's like you're doing work and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m51s)

[you know it's going to be a sucky merge](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m53s)

[like you just you're going whatever](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m55s)

[you're doing it's like yep this is going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m57s)

[to suck doing it anyway](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h53m59s)

[right like yeah so it's like I I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m03s)

[wouldn't mind AI assisted suggestions](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m08s)

[especially if you're doing an ugly merge](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m10s)

[and it and it does like the co-pilot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m13s)

[thing where it sees the change and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m15s)

[realize "Oh I see how you're fixing this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m16s)

[let me be mildly intelligent and help](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m19s)

[you." Right i don't even need to be all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m21s)

[the way intelligent mildly intelligent](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m23s)

[is good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m24s)

[enough okay so this guy should kick off](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m26s)

[again yeah thanks you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m29s)

[are This still bothers me i might have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m33s)

[to submit some feedback on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m36s)

[that kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m38s)

[annoying kind of annoying but it is good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m41s)

[to know that the co-pilot one goes file](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m44s)

[by file so that's interesting or I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m46s)

[should say commit by commit uh okay so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m50s)

[we're going to let that guy rock and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m53s)

[roll and then he should finish oh quick](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h54m56s)

[side check do you know of any onremise](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m00s)

[Nougat](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m02s)

[repositories](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m03s)

[um yeah I don't think Microsoft has a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m05s)

[server version of Azure container repose](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m08s)

[but as a Microsoft uh VIP you might know](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m10s)

[um see so I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m14s)

[think think let you host](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m19s)

[they have they have private ones and I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m27s)

[think Yeah yeah i think their](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m31s)

[enterprise lets you do onrem](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m35s)

[hosting because I I assume that you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m39s)

[because you want onrem repository](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m41s)

[hosting and maybe I should clarify izzy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m45s)

[does it need to be onrem or does it just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m47s)

[need to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m49s)

[private because if all you need is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m52s)

[private like an Azure Artifacts feed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m55s)

[will get you will get you that pretty](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h55m58s)

[easily](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m00s)

[um I don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m04s)

[know project demand](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m11s)

[storage i don't know that it offers you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m13s)

[a thing technically depending on how](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m16s)

[much of a glutton for punishment you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m18s)

[are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m21s)

[um like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m23s)

[uh is this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m26s)

[it yeah so you technically can grab the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m29s)

[the like the Nougat stuff is out there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m33s)

[if you want to run it but like you it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h56m36s)

[of open source developers right like uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h59m38s)

[licensing um and I believe this one he](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=00h59m58s)

[calls out yeah a dual license model](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m02s)

[which is not unlike a handful of other](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m03s)

[open source projects that have done](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m06s)

[similar right where there is a a free](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m07s)

[open-source license available for open](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m11s)

[source developers indie developers](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m14s)

[basically nonprofits if you if your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m17s)

[company is small and you aren't making](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m20s)

[looking to nickel and dine people it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m24s)

[really the "Hey I've got a three billion](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m26s)

[dollar company that's using my stuff why](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m28s)

[are they like why am I spending a bunch](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m31s)

[of my time to support them when they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m34s)

[aren't kicking back anything to to pay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m35s)

[for that kind of support right?" And so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m37s)

[it's this dual licensing model and this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m40s)

[has been a like a really hot topic on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m42s)

[for open source devs and to be clear I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m45s)

[am not planning on changing like I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m47s)

[always hate when open source projects](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m50s)

[change their license that bothers me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m52s)

[what I am more likely to do is maybe a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m55s)

[future project maybe I don't start at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h00m58s)

[open source right like there's there's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m00s)

[bit of that like I I would not be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m02s)

[opposed to that but there's not a good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m04s)

[way out there for people who want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m05s)

[commercialize say a library that they're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m08s)

[building there's not a system out there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m11s)

[for it like there's no good way to do it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m14s)

[and I part of me was like man what I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m16s)

[really want to do is have somebody stand](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m19s)

[packages that they need on this system](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m33s)

[right and then the system maker who's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m36s)

[hosting it you know they'll take a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m38s)

[percentage cut to to maintain the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m39s)

[hosting and all of that jazz but then a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m41s)

[good chunk gets to go to the creator of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m43s)

[the package and they can choose how to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m45s)

[price their stuff and then everybody](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m46s)

[wins right and it it gives an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m48s)

[opportunity to have something out there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m51s)

[right and even if it's like hey we're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m54s)

[going to leave the project open source](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m56s)

[but if you want somebody to package it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m58s)

[up in a Nougat feed yeah you're going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h01m59s)

[pay for that right like that takes time](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h02m01s)

[and effort for me to to keep all of that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h02m03s)

[up and running if that's what if you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h02m05s)

[the end of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m42s)

[year hopefully this weekend my plan is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m44s)

[to spend time building my storage area](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m48s)

[in my garage so that my wife can finish](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m51s)

[unpacking a bunch of stuff from our move](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m54s)

[right now it's all just kind of stacked](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m57s)

[and in an obnoxious situation um and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h08m58s)

[once that is done](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m02s)

[um then I can come back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m05s)

[to to working on my office](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m08s)

[area so that just needs to go like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m11s)

[that and then let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m14s)

[see because this is assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m18s)

[that because this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m22s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m25s)

[that so I need to do a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m26s)

[wait assert that selected](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m29s)

[index is equal to zero](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m35s)

[i think this is the the T-unit way which](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m40s)

[I will say that is the only thing about](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m43s)

[this that gives me a bit of pause that I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m45s)

[don't fully like this has always been](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m47s)

[expected actual expected actual like my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m50s)

[muscle memory is always expected actual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m52s)

[expected actual and this is actual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m54s)

[expected so close so like I get it it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h09m59s)

[it it I I do think it is quickly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m02s)

[becoming my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m04s)

[favorite my favorite testing framework](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m06s)

[so I I will say that like I don't want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m09s)

[to disparage it too much because it is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m11s)

[um it is it is very good in my opinion](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m15s)

[but it is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m19s)

[uh 47 UARK to my left three 3D printers](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m21s)

[to my right and I'm stuck in the middle](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m24s)

[with the overflow](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m26s)

[freezer that's kind of cool i actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m29s)

[got my So I I do not have three 3D](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m31s)

[printers i only have one it's just um an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m35s)

[Ender 3 Pro but it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m38s)

[is zero that looks correct um it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m42s)

[is it's pretty](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m46s)

[cool test context current why do you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m49s)

[think current might be null here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h10m53s)

[test context](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m01s)

[current how did](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m03s)

[we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m11s)

[why I mean I get why test context](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m13s)

[current is probably nullable returning](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m16s)

[because if you use it outside of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m18s)

[context of a test it's probably](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m19s)

[null like that gives](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m22s)

[me I'm I'm really tempted to just no](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m26s)

[bang these I think is what we're gonna](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m29s)

[do because I think these guys are going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m32s)

[to bite](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m35s)

[me and you only have to do the first one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m37s)

[in every test but I have a feeling I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m39s)

[going have to chase a bunch of them the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m41s)

[that's that's the dream setup i was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m52s)

[talking with a guy that um 3D prints](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m54s)

[stuff and then goes to to various](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m57s)

[festivals to sell his](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h11m59s)

[wares and he was showing off his bamboo](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m01s)

[little](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m06s)

[jealous cuz they're they're nice](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m08s)

[printers they are very nice the Enders](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m10s)

[are great bang for your buck i think](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m13s)

[they're a very solid choice um but they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m15s)

[are definitely the printer for somebody](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m18s)

[who wants to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m20s)

[printer 600 millimeter cubed build](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m30s)

[volume that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m33s)

[huge that is huge i was actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m35s)

[surprised because normally I would have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m39s)

[thought oh wow full custom printer but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m41s)

[given like the 3D printing space is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m44s)

[weird because everything was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m47s)

[patented for so long there's actually a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m50s)

[decent amount out for like DIY printer](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m53s)

[bits like I was I was surprised and like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h12m57s)

[especially like the Enders there are so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m00s)

[like it to not be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m22s)

[using gigs and gigs of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m24s)

[RAM i don't know what it's lost its mind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m27s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m30s)

[oh it's not get cracking oh that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m32s)

[interesting because I launched Visual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m36s)

[Studio as a child process oh that is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m38s)

[interesting let's terminate](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m42s)

[that so it shows up as a as a Git Kraken](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m45s)

[chewing memory when it's actually not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m50s)

[Git Kraken's fault](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m52s)

[okay shockingly that made it that made](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m55s)

[things better let me just launch Visual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h13m58s)

[Studio outside of it that is interesting](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m01s)

[because it's a child](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m03s)

[process that'll be cool izzy when you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m06s)

[get that thing up and working shoot me a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m09s)

[picture of it because I'd love to I'd](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m11s)

[love to see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m12s)

[it okay so let's let's fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m15s)

[and once he's done restoring packages to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m19s)

[the other side](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m23s)

[i was actually chatting with another](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m28s)

[streamer earlier today because I'm I am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m29s)

[weird like I am streaming from the same](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m32s)

[machine that is running Visual Studio i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m35s)

[don't have a second streaming box i'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m37s)

[not cool enough for that um I also don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m39s)

[really have a secondary machine that I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m42s)

[think is capable of running streaming](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m45s)

[for me even though I know it's not that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m47s)

[much](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m49s)

[um but they're like "Oh really like when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m51s)

[you hit compile it kills your frame](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m55s)

[rate." And I'm watching like about 200](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h14m56s)

[kilobits per second at least according](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m00s)

[to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m01s)

[OBS uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m02s)

[okay this shot me in the foot in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m05s)

[couple places so specifically everywhere](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m08s)

[where I already had it it's going to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m11s)

[problematic but that wasn't that many](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m14s)

[places](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m16s)

[apparently](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m17s)

[so there's that tab tab](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m20s)

[and then I think I'm going to end up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m24s)

[having to fix all of the warnings](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m25s)

[though uh that's going to be annoying](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m28s)

[but I don't know of a bet like at some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m31s)

[point I think I just have to bite the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m33s)

[bullet and get this done and I'd kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m34s)

[like to get this all the way done](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m37s)

[because it would be very nice at some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m38s)

[point I'm going to go through and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m41s)

[convert all of my bellow pack tests over](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m42s)

[to Tunit because I love it so very much](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m45s)

[like it's gonna it's going to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m48s)

[obnoxious but I don't know of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m51s)

[a there's never a good time to change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m54s)

[test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m57s)

[frameworks but Tunit feels so much](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h15m59s)

[faster that I have a hard time not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m03s)

[thinking that it'll pay dividends in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m06s)

[long run](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m08s)

[um I actually am also planning](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m11s)

[on for my net new templates i'm I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m13s)

[planning on adding in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m17s)

[a an option because I've already got I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m21s)

[think a d- no tests I think is what it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m24s)

[called on there for if you don't want it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m26s)

[to genuine unit test because sometimes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m29s)

[you just don't care right you're doing a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m31s)

[sample or whatever tests aren't needed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m33s)

[like tests are not always a requirement](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m35s)

[i think they're useful in a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m38s)

[but they are not a requirement by any](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m40s)

[means wait why is my why is this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m41s)

[solution just lagging my system out i do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m44s)

[not understand why my mouse](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m48s)

[is put](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m50s)

[this let's see replace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m55s)

[uh let's see XT](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h16m58s)

[currency yeah I thought about that the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m02s)

[only thing that I don't like about doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m04s)

[that JC is I you only need to do it on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m06s)

[the first instance of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m09s)

[test and I only see 35 of them so it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m14s)

[like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m18s)

[H so I think I might just hand hand do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m22s)

[them like I I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m24s)

[I don't like using the null forgiveness](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m27s)

[operator like I I think it needs to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m31s)

[used](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m33s)

[gingerly and only in and only when when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m35s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m39s)

[justifiable which in this case I think](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m40s)

[it's very justifiable](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m42s)

[um and it's only a problem for me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m45s)

[because warnings as errors are enabled](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m47s)

[in the pipeline and so it will fail my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m49s)

[PR which is just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m53s)

[lovely but like I don't want to change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m55s)

[that like it's the warning says there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h17m57s)

[has saved me a number of times so it it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m01s)

[makes sense to make it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m03s)

[better but this will this will bring](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m05s)

[everything back in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m08s)

[line and hopefully make everything just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m10s)

[a little bit nicer for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m12s)

[people yeah you can see even the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m15s)

[compiler knows that if you get past this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m17s)

[first one the subsequent ones aren't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m19s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m21s)

[i'm mildly tempted to do like a base](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m24s)

[class cancellation token thing since all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m27s)

[of these guys share a common base i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m30s)

[could totally do that and then I would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m32s)

[only have to null bang it in one place](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m34s)

[but then I have to go through and change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m36s)

[all the references and I'm like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m37s)

[h that adds a layer of ambiguity](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m39s)

[and there occasionally I will do things](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m45s)

[on the material design project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m48s)

[that may not be as absolutely clever and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m50s)

[as nice as they could be but they are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m55s)

[simpler for people to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m57s)

[understand because one of the strengths](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h18m58s)

[I think of this project is I've I've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m01s)

[tried to spend a little bit of time](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m03s)

[thinking through what makes it easy for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m04s)

[people to contribute to the project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m06s)

[because as an open source project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m09s)

[um ideally like for people who haven't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m12s)

[been paying attention Corin's has been](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m15s)

[absolutely killing it on PRs](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m17s)

[issues responses like absolutely](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m20s)

[knocking things out of the park and this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m24s)

[project kind of goes in es and flows](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m26s)

[like that where there are there are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m29s)

[people that come in that are really](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m31s)

[eager to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m32s)

[help and because it's set up in a way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m33s)

[that makes them feel as though they can](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m36s)

[help they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m38s)

[do so it's I there is a benefit to me to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m40s)

[doing things in a way that may not be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m45s)

[the most clever but it encourages people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m48s)

[to to help out on the project because I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m51s)

[think that's the spirit of of open](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m54s)

[source is people being able to to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m56s)

[contribute to it so I I want to leave it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h19m58s)

[in a situation okay okay see this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m01s)

[where you're inside of a visual element](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m05s)

[you have to be inside of a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m07s)

[test yeah just being able to open VS and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m10s)

[compile help me yeah and when I first](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m13s)

[started on this project there was like a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m15s)

[lot of projects have like this setup](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m17s)

[that you have to do from the read me and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m19s)

[and go through these steps i'm like I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m21s)

[don't want that i want clone](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m23s)

[F5 i like I can't make it much easier](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m27s)

[than that but that that's that's usually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m30s)

[my target is to have as few dependencies](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m33s)

[as possible and I and I can't like I've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m36s)

[actually contemplated having like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m39s)

[um an alternate build setup where the pi](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m42s)

[where it only loads in the the newest](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m46s)

[framework in the CS projects and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m50s)

[like on the pipeline I do something](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m52s)

[clever to to swap out and and put in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m54s)

[other ones but it makes for a poor dev](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m57s)

[experience locally because it's like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h20m59s)

[some people don't want to have to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m01s)

[install like three different frameworks](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m02s)

[like that's that's obnoxious](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m04s)

[um but I I don't know a good way around](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m07s)

[that one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m10s)

[yet because it's like yeah I could make](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m11s)

[that work but then when I'm trying to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m13s)

[development and target crossplat stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m16s)

[it's somewhat](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m19s)

[problematic okay so I think that handles](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m23s)

[all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m25s)

[the no ref ones](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m26s)

[h let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m35s)

[see these are all net 6 ones because we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m39s)

[revved to 9.0 Nougat](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m43s)

[packages there are warnings that they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m46s)

[are not tested with net 6 and may not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m48s)

[work i'm going to ignore these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h21m55s)

[uh thought about breaking out demos into](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m02s)

[a separate repo and then submodule them](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m04s)

[back in yeah I actually considered that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m05s)

[at one point because I have my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m07s)

[um I've got my examples](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m11s)

[repository which is not it's not quite](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m16s)

[demo apps but it's all my individual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m19s)

[bits of you know when people have asked](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m22s)

[me questions I'll just like espec](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m25s)

[because some questions are just easier](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m27s)

[to answer with a full project rather](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m29s)

[than just like a one file situation so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m31s)

[it's it's just easier if there's a full](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m34s)

[thing there um and I've I've considered](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m36s)

[separating those things out just to make](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m40s)

[them a little bit easier the only thing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m42s)

[is subm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m47s)

[modules are difficult for a lot of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m49s)

[people to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m52s)

[manage like one of my uh prior employers](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m54s)

[they they love subm modules they used](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h22m58s)

[them for everything and so whether I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m00s)

[liked it or not I was going to learn](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m02s)

[them but I did notice that every time](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m04s)

[they brought in a new dev there was it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m08s)

[was not a a well-known thing not a like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m11s)

[some people are great with subm modules](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m14s)

[but they do make the git is already kind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m16s)

[of complicated and they add another](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m18s)

[layer of complication on there so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m21s)

[there's it makes things slightly more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m23s)

[interesting for people um like the most](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m27s)

[common error that I see on open source](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m30s)

[projects with subm modules is somebody](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m32s)

[goes to contribute and they don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m34s)

[initialize the subm module a because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m36s)

[they're not using git kraken with a nice](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m38s)

[popup that says "Hey would you like to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m40s)

[initialize the sub modules now?" And so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m41s)

[they don't realize there's a second step](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m43s)

[right if you just straight clone a repo](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m45s)

[with a subm module you don't get that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m47s)

[um nice feedback that says "Hey you've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m50s)

[got a sub module here you need to do you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m54s)

[know get subm module in it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m56s)

[and then you end up getting hosted and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h23m58s)

[you get bug reports of hey there's no](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m00s)

[demo projects despite the fact that the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m02s)

[solution references them it's like well](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m04s)

[yeah they're there you just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m06s)

[gota you just got to hit them right okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m08s)

[so what did I change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m10s)

[here okay so that's fine and then all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m15s)

[those are fine uh autode write the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m18s)

[commit message for me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m21s)

[i do not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m27s)

[want this is one thing um actually you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m29s)

[know what we're going to try something i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m33s)

[don't like that this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m34s)

[um let's go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m39s)

[here uh let's see when we are commit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m41s)

[message uh do not attempt to explain the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m45s)

[why and uh do not attempt to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m54s)

[explain why a change was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h24m58s)

[made uh only](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m03s)

[report what was changed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m06s)

[okay I am sick and tired of that thing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m11s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m14s)

[that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m22s)

[great send it okay so that should get](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m24s)

[that up and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m28s)

[going force push that force push that i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m30s)

[really need to tick that do not I keep I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m33s)

[want to be able to hit that do not ask](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m36s)

[me again after I click the button okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m38s)

[so that gets me to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m40s)

[there that gets that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m42s)

[going check over](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m46s)

[here hey Velopac deployed all the way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m51s)

[out](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m54s)

[huzzah okay great um I will go and test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m55s)

[that later uh because that is production](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h25m59s)

[and that will require actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m02s)

[generating real stuff so that I don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m04s)

[really want to do on stream](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m08s)

[because that would that's going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m09s)

[involve some some secrets to be on my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m11s)

[screen and I just feel like that's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m15s)

[recipe for me to shoot myself in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m16s)

[foot so I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m18s)

[will do the same type of test that we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m21s)

[did before um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m23s)

[okay next thing that I want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m27s)

[do while that guy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m30s)

[is chugging](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m32s)

[away is you should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m34s)

[now why are you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m39s)

[not You already failed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m42s)

[out failed after two](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h26m45s)

[to grab my my MSI branch set local here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m15s)

[and then we are going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m21s)

[to rebase you up to here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m23s)

[we'll take it a a hot minute because in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m35s)

[case you didn't notice there was a long](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m38s)

[string of commits](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m40s)

[there that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m42s)

[exciting and then we'll move the example](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m44s)

[branch up here in a moment okay so if we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m47s)

[are looking](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m51s)

[at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m56s)

[okay so specifically the previous one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h32m58s)

[was failing and I believe it was not a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m01s)

[difficult problem it's failing on Mac](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m04s)

[because I'm calling a Windows](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m08s)

[API in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m10s)

[um I'm calling a Windows API without](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m15s)

[appropriately uh tying it down to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m17s)

[Windows so Rust source lib](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m20s)

[5152 uh let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m24s)

[see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m27s)

[uh source](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m31s)

[lib right am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m33s)

[I source lib ROS source lib RS](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m36s)

[uh that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m46s)

[not fail to resolve use of undeclared](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m52s)

[crate or module windows](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h33m55s)

[yeah so this needs the the the Windows](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m06s)

[bit added to it i don't remember what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m10s)

[that is so we're just going to pin this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m13s)

[guy here for a second we'll come back to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m14s)

[him in a minute because the other one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m15s)

[has](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m17s)

[it let's see and this is the same file](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m18s)

[01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,480](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m22s)

uh let's see

[here help trade open options ext which](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m28s)

[provides custom flags implemented but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m32s)

[not in scope perhaps you wanted to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m34s)

[import](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m36s)

[it uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m41s)

[maybe that is a definite maybe so the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m44s)

[the chain the uh we are not using it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m47s)

[anywhere else so I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m50s)

[probably not the solution we want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h34m52s)

[there it is this This is the magical bit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m07s)

[see I knew I'd find it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m09s)

[um yeah so the what's what's going on in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m12s)

[this code is in an attempt to determine](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m16s)

[whether a directory is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m19s)

[writable we basically try to uh open a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m21s)

[file inside of it but Windows has this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m26s)

[cool file flags delete on close so we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m29s)

[basically just try to open the file](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m31s)

[handle and as long as we don't get](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m33s)

[rejected we go well I had write access](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m35s)

[enough to create the file we're going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m38s)

[assume we've got right access to this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m40s)

[directory and carry on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m42s)

[right because that's it's probably](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m44s)

[accurate enough uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m47s)

[uh Revolute yeah I think I said that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m51s)

[wrong it's um renovate I think is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h35m53s)

[theate i think is what it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h36m03s)

[is yeah this guy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h36m08s)

[.NET Scala Ruby Go Docker and more 90](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h36m19s)

[different package](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h36m23s)

[computer telling you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h39m47s)

[things and then the enlightenment point](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h39m49s)

[is when you get to tell it that it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h39m51s)

[wrong most of the airs are unreadable i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h39m54s)

[know i I will say there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h39m57s)

[tools that I use where it's very clear](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h39m59s)

[that it's written by developers for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m01s)

[developers because developers will sneak](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m03s)

[sneak in verbiage like that of yeah you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m06s)

[nobody likes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m22s)

[that no nobody wants to be talked down](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m23s)

[to by a machine yeah there's a there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m26s)

[I'm trying to remember what they were](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m29s)

[there was one I ran into recently in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m31s)

[was absolutely blanking on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m38s)

[it yeah I don't remember](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m43s)

[at some point I'm hoping to get back and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m48s)

[I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m50s)

[a fan of the sniper elite franchise](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m56s)

[partly because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h40m59s)

[um the the early ones I think before](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m01s)

[five they were all single player only i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m04s)

[think five or four was the first one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m07s)

[that added co-op to it um and I picked](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m09s)

[it up uh partly because it was single](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m11s)

[player and it meant that I could just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m14s)

[kind of pause and shut it down whenever](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m16s)

[I needed to um lots of the MDX](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h41m17s)

[run all these tests in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h42m21s)

[parallel because we didn't change these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h42m25s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h42m28s)

[ah I'm betting it tried to because ZAML](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h42m33s)

[test will very much not be okay with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h42m37s)

[here i'm just I'm I'm falling in love](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h43m39s)

[with this more and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h43m41s)

[more oh T unit you are going to make me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h43m43s)

[to happen auto mocker is about to get an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h43m56s)

[update](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h43m59s)

[um not in parallel that sounds like what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m01s)

[I want by default Tote tests will run in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m03s)

[parallel yeah I'd like to turn that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m08s)

[off at least on a project level if I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m11s)

[could](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m14s)

[please yeah so uh tunit well so in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m18s)

[net space there were kind of three big](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m24s)

[players for unit testing there was the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m26s)

[the Microsoft testing one which has gone](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m29s)

[by MS test visual studio test Microsoft](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m32s)

[testing framework because their naming](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m35s)

[sucked but it was all effectively](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m38s)

[similar or uh oftentimes grouped there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m40s)

[was nunit and there was xunit and I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m43s)

[think though like there was a handful of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m45s)

[others that were out there but those](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m46s)

[were the big three and so I would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m48s)

[usually tell people pick one of the big](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m50s)

[three you'll be fine if you if you stay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m52s)

[in the well well tested land tunit is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m54s)

[the new kit on the field um and it got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h44m57s)

[rebuilt with some of the latest car](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m00s)

[features with source generators and it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m03s)

[just I fell in love with it quickly but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m07s)

[yes absolutely a uh a testing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m11s)

[framework uh yeah don't forget to push](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m15s)

[the force push button thank you JC have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m19s)

[a good day at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m21s)

[work um parallel limiter i want to turn](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m23s)

[Aha if you want to do a global limit on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m30s)

[an assembly you can do this well that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m32s)

[looks like exactly what I want i would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m35s)

[like to limit it for an entire project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m36s)

[that sounds like exactly what I want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m39s)

[let's do that i am still on that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m44s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m46s)

[uh did I close it that was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m48s)

[dumb uh give it to me back there we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m54s)

[go yeah I'm on the right branch](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h45m57s)

[okay so this project here I absolutely](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m01s)

[want to make sure that it runs](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m05s)

[I do have a parallel](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m09s)

[limiter we did this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m12s)

[before well that's not that's not making](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m18s)

[me feel warm and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m21s)

[fuzzy we add a parallel limiter](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m25s)

[attribute you'll know the generic](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m27s)

[argument](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m29s)

[yeah as a public empty](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m30s)

[constructor uh it'll try to eagerly run](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m34s)

[when it allows it so the upper limit is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m37s)

[unknown](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m40s)

[great like that's in most cases this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m41s)

[nice right tunit says "I want all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m44s)

[your threads i would like to run as fast](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m47s)

[as humanly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m49s)

[possible."](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m51s)

[Um other tests without this attribute](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m56s)

[may run alongside them still](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h46m59s)

[oh I don't think that's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m01s)

[problem i don't think that is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m08s)

[problem uh let's see other tests with a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m13s)

[different type of parallel limit may](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m16s)

[also run alongside them still but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m17s)

[limited amongst themselves so they're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m19s)

[grouped based upon your generic type](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m21s)

[okay great um be aware that limits are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m23s)

[only shared among tests with the same](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m27s)

[parallel limit type](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m29s)

[great as long as it isn't overridden on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m31s)

[a test or class then this will apply to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m34s)

[all tests in the assembly and be shared](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m36s)

[among all of them looting blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m38s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m39s)

[okay you mean troubleshooting doesn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m41s)

[fill you with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m43s)

[joy solving a bug fills me with a great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m46s)

[deal of joy i absolutely love it when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m49s)

[when it feels like you sniped a bug from](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m54s)

[a thousand feet like that feels great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m56s)

[that is awesome like when somebody gives](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h47m59s)

[like I love it when I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m03s)

[get I'll say it can be frustrating the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m05s)

[bare minimum amount of information](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m09s)

[needed in a in like a bug report and and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m11s)

[it's just enough to be able to figure](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m16s)

[out exactly what's going on right like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m18s)

[when it's just barely enough like I've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m21s)

[got a couple colleagues we will do what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m23s)

[I call spot the bug problems where when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m25s)

[we finally track down a bug we will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m28s)

[we'll usually like screenshot the area](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m30s)

[and go okay where's the bug in this code](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m31s)

[and sometimes it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m35s)

[real hard to see like and more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m38s)

[importantly like I've got one colleague](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m41s)

[we get we get made fun of a lot because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m43s)

[we give each other crap all day long um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m45s)

[but we will oftenimes blame each other](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m48s)

[for failures before even looking at it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m50s)

[and I can assure you if I do a get blame](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m52s)

[and I see his name on the line oh heck](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m54s)

[yeah I'm screenshotting that and sending](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m57s)

[it to him because nothing fills me with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h48m58s)

[greater joy than sniping the bug and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m00s)

[realizing he was the cause of it that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m03s)

[makes me very](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m05s)

[happy very very happy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m07s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m11s)

[this it doesn't tell me what to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m15s)

[here they because we did exactly what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m19s)

[they did in their sample i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m23s)

[literally duplicated this i guess maybe](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m27s)

[the question is I'm I'm making an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m29s)

[assumption here i am making an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m31s)

[assumption test failed at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m35s)

[It's so weird that so many of these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m43s)

[would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m46s)

[fail so let's let's let's just run one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h49m50s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h52m24s)

[there what concerns me is this is line](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h52m29s)

[01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:39,199](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h52m32s)

[why would it fail](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h52m49s)

[here it's also interesting to me that I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h52m54s)

[don't see this thing enabling which g](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h52m57s)

[which also gives me a bit of pause that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m00s)

[I might be having a tooling](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m02s)

[problem could be a tooling problem](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m07s)

[well let's let's see if we can debug](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m15s)

[this sucker uh so let's see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m17s)

[here so up here we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m21s)

[and I'm going to put in a constructor](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m24s)

[and then uh see attach debugger to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m26s)

[remote process false](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m30s)

[so I want to stop](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m34s)

[here and I would like to see what the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m38s)

[heck is going on in my UI at the point](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m40s)

[we reach that break point so when it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m43s)

[starts this the there's a separate](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m46s)

[process that the app will launch in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m48s)

[separate from the the unit test and so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m51s)

[when the unit test hits a break point it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m54s)

[will pause but because I'm uh not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m56s)

[attaching my debugger to that remote](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h53m58s)

[i wonder if me do if there is still a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m07s)

[reference to XUnit hanging around](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m10s)

[somewhere maybe the Okay so I two](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m12s)

[theories two theories there is an XUnit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m16s)

[runner still floating around](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m19s)

[somewhere okay I wonder okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m21s)

[theory there is something XUnity still](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m25s)

[floating around in the project and it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m28s)

[needs to die because I've got two things](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h57m30s)

[kill that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m03s)

[off and then the Xunit runner i am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m08s)

[wondering if it's having the dual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m11s)

[runners that are the that are the key](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m13s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m17s)

[children that that's my that is my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m19s)

[theory is that I've got a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m22s)

[hosing me and making my life miserable](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m27s)

[hate this the transitive dependency okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m47s)

[we'll deal with that in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m50s)

[minute okay let's deal with the build](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m53s)

[problems after doing that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h58m57s)

[uh xunit there was migrating from xunit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h59m48s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=01h59m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h00m23s)

[moment and then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h00m23s)

[let me do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m33s)

[nine](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m36s)

[paste i will say just the fact that this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m37s)

[testing library has built analyzers to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m41s)

[go through and do the conversion for you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m44s)

[like that's a level of effort that a lot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m46s)

[of library authors do not do i don't do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m49s)

[it or I think any of my libraries like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m52s)

[there's a lot of polish on this for this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m56s)

[being a a new kit on the block it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h05m58s)

[revert this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m09s)

[bit discard thank you then we will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m11s)

[tomorrow I don't have to do coding i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m41s)

[have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m43s)

[to do a we'll call it a leadership](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m44s)

[retreat slashtraining](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m47s)

[so unfortunately](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m50s)

[means not likely to write a line of code](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m52s)

[tomorrow at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m55s)

[all okay so this does all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h06m57s)

[this now let's see remove manual bits](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m03s)

[that are still necessary remove XUnit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m06s)

[packages great would love to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m11s)

[okay relaunch re rinse re](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m16s)

[repeat okay so we're just going to burn](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m20s)

[XUnit to the ground that makes me feel](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m23s)

[better i am surprised that if I delete a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m26s)

[package out of my directory packages](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m29s)

[props that I don't get a useful](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m31s)

[error like I would have expected the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m34s)

[projects that were still referencing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m36s)

[xUnit to say](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m38s)

["Hey couldn't find a correct version for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m39s)

[XUnit rather than version range is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m42s)

[null." Like that's not a useful error](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m44s)

[message](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m46s)

[just surprised it's not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m49s)

[better feels like it should be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m51s)

[better](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m54s)

[okay so let's start with this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h07m56s)

[build](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m01s)

[right uh let's see t-unit asserts](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m08s)

[00002 didn't we run one of those](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m12s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m19s)

[here i'm surprised this one didn't get](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m21s)

[applied search statements must be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m33s)

[awaited yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m35s)

[yeah apply that fix please](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m39s)

[thank](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m45s)

[you don't make me think that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m46s)

[hard grows](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m49s)

[exactly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m52s)

[uh bring that in i don't want to have to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m54s)

[reference this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h08m58s)

[so I am a big](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m00s)

[fan of doing cheap stuff like that where](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m03s)

[we use global using so some people like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m07s)

[to do C# global using in a C file i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m10s)

[prefer doing it in my CS Proje or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m13s)

[similar um because this allows me to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m16s)

[leverage MS build so then if I want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m19s)

[share it between projects or do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m20s)

[conditionals or what kind not I just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m22s)

[find it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m25s)

[easier um what is your problem use](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m26s)

[expression body for method i don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m29s)

[actually care about that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m31s)

[uh let's see class data source shared](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m34s)

[per](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m37s)

[class](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m41s)

[oh great and now you can see the using](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m44s)

[is unused so controlrg cleans it up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m47s)

[okay just see what else has we got okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m50s)

[so we have STA theory and inline data i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h09m53s)

[thought one of these guys had a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m00s)

[conversion for inline](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m03s)

[data](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m06s)

[um and I know there is an STA option as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m09s)

[well](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m14s)

[so data driven](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m18s)

[tests yeah inline data gets replaced](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m20s)

[with arguments so we're going to just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m23s)

[blindly we're going to blindly find and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m25s)

[replace that in the current project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m29s)

[don't use regular expressions send](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m33s)

[it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m37s)

[there okay that gets me a good chunk of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m38s)

[the way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m41s)

[there missing test](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m43s)

[attribute sta theory i don't really want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m46s)

[to change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m50s)

[i need to we need to look at what the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m54s)

[STA equivalent](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m55s)

[is so STA is singlethreaded apartment um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h10m58s)

[as opposed to multi-threaded apartment](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m03s)

[and this does not refer to lodging it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m05s)

[refers to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m08s)

[uh the type of thread that is created](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m11s)

[typically STA threads are going to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m14s)

[like your UI threads because in a lot of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m16s)

[UI frameworks only one thread at a time](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m19s)

[is allowed to touch your UI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m22s)

[elements versus background threads or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m24s)

[MTA threads you know they're just kind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m26s)

[of the the worker bees that are off to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m28s)

[the races right your STA thread is like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m30s)

[your queen bee who you know controls the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m32s)

[the situation and then all of your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h11m34s)

[have to rev a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m30s)

[version dedicated thread executor](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m34s)

[yeah okay so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m38s)

[what what version are we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m41s)

[big difference here manage nougat](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m46s)

[packages so I think what has happened is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m50s)

[there is both](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m54s)

[a look at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m56s)

[that is that there is both a class and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h14m58s)

[an attribute now they don't have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m01s)

[duplicated class names but when you're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m04s)

[declaring an attribute you don't have to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m07s)

[type the the the attribute suffix part](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m10s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m14s)

[name because of that I think what is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m16s)

[going on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m19s)

[um is they look like they Yeah see there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m21s)

[we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m24s)

[go okay okay so solution is to rev your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m25s)

[version like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m30s)

[that and we are going to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m33s)

[this boom replace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m37s)

[all 82 occurrences that will save me a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m40s)

[lot of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m44s)

[errors okay and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m46s)

[then MX unit is a given](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m49s)

[okay uh let's see here assert does not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m53s)

[contain a definition for equals see and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m56s)

[this is what I noticed before is that it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h15m59s)

[was like it hit some of the asserts but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m01s)

[not all i I I suspect there is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m04s)

[bug oh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m07s)

[oh I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m11s)

[wonder I wonder](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m17s)

[if the if that is an issue with the old](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m22s)

[Nougat package that Oh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m25s)

[that I don't know that it's worth going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m29s)

[back and fixing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m31s)

[but I wonder if that's an issue with the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m34s)

[old package which is Oh that would make](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m36s)

[a lot of sense oh that would make a lot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m38s)

[of sense](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m40s)

[uh is equal to it's going to be more](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m41s)

[typing for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m43s)

[me trying to decide how much I care uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m45s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m50s)

[see uh sert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m52s)

[that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h16m56s)

[um on one hand I don't mind typing a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m05s)

[little bit of this because I I feel like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m08s)

[I want to build the muscle memory on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m10s)

[this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m12s)

[if foreground is equal to and I think I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m20s)

[can go and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m22s)

[uh is not equal to default so it it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m26s)

[allows me to combine the two asserts](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m31s)

[into one now which is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m32s)

[nicer i like that i like that okay how](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m34s)

[how bad is it let's see how bad is it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m39s)

[how](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m43s)

[bad come on think that's that's a lot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h17m52s)

[200 okay let's see how many of these we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m00s)

[can kill in one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m03s)

[shot find and replace with empty string](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m05s)

[replace all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m08s)

[okay that killed off 19 of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m10s)

[them um what is your problem it's not an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m13s)

[attribute class we just did this a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m17s)

[second](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m19s)

[ago uh I think you will find that it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m21s)

[is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m29s)

[uh I would like to make this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m33s)

[a global](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m40s)

[using i'm surprised that in their](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m42s)

[generated global using that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m45s)

[not that that's not part of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m48s)

[them feels like that should be part of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m51s)

[the global using okay so these are just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m53s)

[all assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h18m57s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m01s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m04s)

[so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m07s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m09s)

[okay break out our reax coding](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m11s)

[um guess we'll do it in Visual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m15s)

[Studio so I would like to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m18s)

[find let's see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m21s)

[whitace at least one character followed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m23s)

[by assert dot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m27s)

[equal and the dot needs to be escape so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m30s)

[I get a literal Yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m33s)

[i know cutie i know the the as the old](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m37s)

[adage goes you solve a problem with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m41s)

[rejects and now you have two](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m43s)

[problems but in this case I think it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m45s)

[okay and I say that and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m48s)

[immediately](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m51s)

[uh hate it uh let's see expected is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m53s)

[going to be any character that is not a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h19m57s)

[comma](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m00s)

[uh at least one repetition or I should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m02s)

[say one or more repetitions followed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m05s)

[by any amount of white](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m09s)

[space and actually let's allow any](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m13s)

[amount of white space here followed by a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m15s)

[comma followed by any amount of white](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m19s)

[space followed by a named capture group](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m22s)

[that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m26s)

[is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m27s)

[actual which is going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m29s)

[be any character that is not a closing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m32s)

[curly brace like this is going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m38s)

[totally hose](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m40s)

[me this is totally going to hose me um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m43s)

[if there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m46s)

[are strings because I'm not dealing with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m49s)

[that and I'm not even going to try uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m53s)

[this is just to get me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m55s)

[close some number of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h20m57s)

[repetitions that closes the capture](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m01s)

[group any amount of white space](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m04s)

[following it with a literal closing pen](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m06s)

[followed by a semicolon see how simple](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m09s)

[is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m12s)

[that it's just it's just that and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m13s)

[obviously we then replace it with await](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m17s)

[assert uh I want to look at the one that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m20s)

[we just did to make sure I get this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m24s)

[right nope not that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m26s)

[one uh something more like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m29s)

[that my brain is just looking at it uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m34s)

[that's how you know that you're still](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m38s)

[sane uh let's see assert that and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m40s)

[we would like to plug](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m44s)

[in what is the replacement for is it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m49s)

[dollar sign](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m53s)

[name](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m55s)

[uh I think it's dollar](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h21m57s)

[sign I think is the the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m01s)

[appropriate replacement uh no assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m04s)

[that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m08s)

[actual is equal to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m14s)

[expected i think that's the way that it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m16s)

[works we're going to go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m18s)

[here and we're going to go find](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m21s)

[next oh the following specified text was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m24s)

[not found really let's turn on regular](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m27s)

[expressions let's try this again there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m29s)

[we found one great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m31s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m35s)

[um I would like to replace exactly one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m38s)

[of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m42s)

[them that is so it didn't get um how do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m45s)

[I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m49s)

[do dollar sign curly brace name hey I I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m53s)

[was close i was close i I had one out of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h22m58s)

[three of the characters right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m01s)

[so it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m03s)

[looks like that I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m05s)

[think place](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m07s)

[next](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m13s)

[okay that gets me to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m15s)

[there um I need to undo that and I need](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m20s)

[to add in a space at the beginning](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m24s)

[because we're capturing this space here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m27s)

[and I don't want to deal with capture](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m29s)

[but exclude](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m31s)

[uh send it send it 140 airs](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m38s)

[one what did I do wrong](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h23m54s)

[so why did you not match this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m01s)

[one oh because there's a PN in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m09s)

[it um let's change this from here to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m18s)

[this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m25s)

[find](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m28s)

[next replace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m30s)

[next there place all send it there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m35s)

[another 63 okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m38s)

[okay uh actually I can I now autocode my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m44s)

[way to victory here make method a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m49s)

[async fix and document i just want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h24m57s)

[test to make sure that this is actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m00s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m02s)

[that make method async](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m12s)

[no you'll go async void but you won't do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m16s)

[async task without putting in the diff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m19s)

[want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m44s)

[i I'm seriously tempted to try to find](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m45s)

[the reax to hunt these guys out but I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m47s)

[think these ones might just be faster to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m50s)

[do this way there's not going to be that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m51s)

[many of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m54s)

[them okay so assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m55s)

[true this is going to be await assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h25m59s)

[that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h26m03s)

[uh is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h26m05s)

[true software being smart and dumb at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h26m08s)

[the same I know i know it's horrible it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h26m10s)

[is absolutely horrible i Okay a certain](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h26m13s)

[off okay so that that got me to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m36s)

[there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m42s)

[okay we've got a not equal one here we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m44s)

[can probably](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m47s)

[do We can probably do this we can](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m48s)

[probably do the not equal very similar](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m52s)

[to this one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m55s)

[assert not equal and I want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h29m57s)

[be here assert that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m01s)

[is not equal](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m04s)

[to place next](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m07s)

[uh let's see what did I do wrong](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m11s)

[hereert not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m16s)

[equal expected](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m20s)

[did oh you got to turn on regular](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m24s)

[expressions for that to work place](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m26s)

[next and that just worked okay we're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m37s)

[going to replace all there great it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m40s)

[fixed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m43s)

[one almost had a heart attack yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m44s)

[that was almost very very very very bad](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m48s)

[okay and on a positive note this has](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m55s)

[cleaned up a ton like we're totally](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h30m57s)

[done](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m04s)

[um I think most of these are going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m07s)

[be stop being](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m11s)

[um wow that's going to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m21s)

[brutal assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m24s)

[that hold on we're going to write this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m31s)

[alongside aw](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m35s)

[of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m40s)

[cowbell you're not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m42s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m44s)

[um let's see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m46s)

[is greater](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m49s)

[than last](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m51s)

[saturation](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m54s)

[um I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h31m57s)

[think do not populate this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m01s)

[value there's a way oh because that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m06s)

[the it's like there's a way to specify](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m09s)

[the message](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m11s)

[like I know there's a way because I ran](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m15s)

[I I think I spent the first time we did](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m17s)

[this spending time digging through the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m19s)

[docs to find it so I like I know it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m21s)

[there okay let's let's do the let's do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m25s)

[the true ones since we're seeing enough](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m30s)

[of these assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m33s)

[uh let's see this is going to be assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m37s)

[true uh and we're going to call this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m41s)

[expression and it's going to end up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m45s)

[being](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m47s)

[uh actually it'll be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m49s)

[any No I think we could do any character](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m51s)

[because this thing's going to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m54s)

[greedy uh we don't care about that we do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m55s)

[want trailing whites space we don't care](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h32m59s)

[about](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m01s)

[actual we do want a literal thing there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m02s)

[this should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m06s)

[match fine next good assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m07s)

[that this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m12s)

[becomes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m14s)

[expression is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m16s)

[true like that I think so let's do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m19s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m23s)

[next right send](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m24s)

[it 14 more errors](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m27s)

[gone](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m30s)

[okay on a positive note this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m33s)

[getting like we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m37s)

[I know it was a lot of errors but it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m40s)

[should be getting in the realm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m43s)

[of reasonable here in a moment rating](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m45s)

[bar test apparently has some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m47s)

[issues uh yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m53s)

[I I I botched something in here big time](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h33m57s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m07s)

[here so let's just fix these ones](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m10s)

[because they clearly didn't get cleaned](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m14s)

[up properly there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m15s)

[there there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m19s)

[there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m21s)

[there like I do not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m25s)

[understand how their analyzer got one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m27s)

[but not the other whoops](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m31s)

[but I think we were fairly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m40s)

[low by fairly low I mean a mere 232](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m42s)

[errors weren't we at about that the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m46s)

[first time it feels like that number](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m48s)

[didn't get smaller despite the mass find](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m51s)

[and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m54s)

[replaces probably the compiler that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m56s)

[how far it got before it finally gave up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h34m58s)

[and was like "You're an idiot." Yeah a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m00s)

[mere 200 a mere](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m03s)

[200 i I I will be very excited um I want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m07s)

[to do some pipeline runs because there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m12s)

[a decent number of tests in this project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m14s)

[or in this solution i want I want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m18s)

[see I want to see if there is a Oh we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m23s)

[can clean that up too while we're in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m28s)

[here I want to see if there's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m29s)

[noticeable performance](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m30s)

[bump after after doing this like that i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m34s)

[I expect that there will be but I aside](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m40s)

[from seeing other people report that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m44s)

[they got good performance bumps I have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m46s)

[no other evidence to suggest that it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m48s)

[would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m53s)

[um let's see assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m55s)

[Uh maybe we should do this one as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h35m59s)

[uh find and replace as well so let's do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m03s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m07s)

[uh not null expression assert that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m09s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m13s)

[is not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m17s)

[null send](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m20s)

[it okay why do you show](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m25s)

[unused oh you aren't unused it's just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m29s)

[that we can gain a performance bump by](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m33s)

[not using the interface](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m36s)

[are declared incorrectly for your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m44s)

[um converter the the default WPF](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m55s)

[interfaces are not decorated for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h36m58s)

[nullability so they are uh in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m00s)

[unknown case so even though this doesn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m03s)

[have a question mark it's unknown](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m05s)

[whether it's nullable or not which means](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m07s)

[you treat them like nullable i generally](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m08s)

[because they haven't been decorated yet](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m11s)

[it gives you the freedom to pick which](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m13s)

[way you want your project to do i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m16s)

[generally treat target type and culture](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m18s)

[as non-null](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m20s)

[because this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m21s)

[uh it's usually fairly safe to assume](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m26s)

[that WPF isn't broken that that's going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m29s)

[to work there oh I forgot the return](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m32s)

[types on the other](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m34s)

[bugs](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m38s)

[and this is an internal class so it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m40s)

[not that big of a deal but I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m41s)

[do should we should clean these up while](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m46s)

[I see them because at one point in time](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m48s)

[I went through the entire project and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m50s)

[tried to get nullability enabled](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m53s)

[properly for the entire](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m55s)

[thing and I think I got like a solid 70%](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h37m58s)

[right the first try](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m02s)

[i thought I was higher when I did it and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m05s)

[then I was promptly proven to be an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m07s)

[idiot and that's okay that's why we do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m11s)

[open source because then other people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m14s)

[can see our mistakes and hopefully help](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m16s)

[make it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m19s)

[better or point and laugh it's really](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m20s)

[50/50 well I will say surprisingly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m23s)

[despite how much people say that there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m26s)

[a lot of like negative things and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m29s)

[whatnot and I'm probably about to jinx](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m32s)

[it i don't like I feel like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m33s)

[on this project at least the people who](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m38s)

[like there's been like there's been a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m46s)

[handful of trolls but I can probably](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m49s)

[count them on one hand in the last like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m51s)

[four](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m54s)

[years it's not it's not been many which](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m55s)

[has](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h38m58s)

[been remarkably refreshing and I realize](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m00s)

[I say that and I'm probably about to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m04s)

[just you know get slammed because you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m06s)

[know that's the way that's the way it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m07s)

[goes but it it has been remarkably](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m11s)

[similar kind of the same thing with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m14s)

[like YouTube comments like people always](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m17s)

[say how YouTube's a you know a cess pool](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m20s)

[of feedback](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m23s)

[and for some reason](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m25s)

[I I don't feel like I get as many as I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m28s)

[see other people receiving and I don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m33s)

[really have a good explanation as to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m35s)

[why i'd like to think it's my friendly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m38s)

[face but I'm fairly confident that that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m41s)

[is 100%](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m44s)

[wrong okay so that goes there that goes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m49s)

[there that goes there this this whole](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m51s)

[file is just an absolute](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m53s)

[mess](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m56s)

[okay i mean on a positive note we have](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h39m58s)

[tests on a negative note they're kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m01s)

[It's definitely the friendly face well](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m03s)

[thank you i appreciate that i don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m05s)

[fully believe it but I appreciate it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m09s)

[okay so what what kind of mess did I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m11s)

[leave myself up here so I made an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m15s)

[absolute nightmare of a mess out of this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m18s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m22s)

[here and what are you wanting to do here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m24s)

[object initialization can be simplified](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m27s)

[no no you cannot be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m30s)

[uh line 427 fix the variable declaration](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m34s)

[thank you see people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m37s)

[helping](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m40s)

[427 oh thank you got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m41s)

[got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m45s)

[it good spot good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m48s)

[spot and you'll note my cheater way of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m51s)

[doing this is I type var and then let](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m54s)

[the uh the compiler type in the full](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m56s)

[type name for me because I am way too](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h40m58s)

[lazy to type in that many characters vr](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m00s)

[even feels like a lot at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m03s)

[times see like I said the the people who](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m08s)

[help out on this project remarkably kind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m11s)

[and helpful](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m14s)

[so Bananatron thank](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m16s)

[you change this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m19s)

[out so for those people confused about](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m21s)

[why doing this here is the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m24s)

[explanation right so concrete types are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m28s)

[more performant than going through](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m32s)

[interfaces because at runtime it has to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m33s)

[effectively do lookups and figure out](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m37s)

[where where things uh where the actual](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m40s)

[method things work so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m43s)

[May this might be a fun stream at some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m46s)

[point um I am an amateur when it comes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m48s)

[to debugging the net runtime but I know](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m51s)

[more than enough to be dangerous um it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m54s)

[kind of cool to go through and look at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h41m57s)

[the method tables for objects because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m00s)

[when the .NET runtime starts you can](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m03s)

[imagine there's this big Excel](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m05s)

[spreadsheet that says where in memory](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m06s)

[all of these functions are located at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m10s)

[and when you're on a concrete type it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m12s)

[very easy it's the method is here it's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m15s)

[single lookup but when you go through an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m18s)

[interface that's a virtualized call and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m20s)

[virtualized calls we now have to take um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m22s)

[inheritance hierarchies into account so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m25s)

[same with like virtual methods so you'll](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m28s)

[see recommendations to not make a method](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m30s)

[virtual unless it's going to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m32s)

[overridden or you'll see recommendations](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m34s)

[to make a class sealed or similar](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m35s)

[effectively what it does is that uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m37s)

[method lookup when it's going through](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m40s)

[the table to try to figure out okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m42s)

[which memory address do I need to jump](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m44s)

[to if it doesn't have to look up where](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m46s)

[that is and it's just a straight here's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m49s)

[the row here's the memory address jump](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m52s)

[that's much faster than if it has to go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m54s)

[well this is virtual let me check if the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m56s)

[derived types override this okay let me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h42m58s)

[go there so like in cases like this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m00s)

[where it's entirely internal yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m02s)

[there's no reason not to Now I will say](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m06s)

[this analyzer does fall over i got bit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m08s)

[by it on my day job at one point because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m11s)

[somebody had written a default interface](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m15s)

[member um so so they actually like wrote](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m19s)

[a like oh I can't do it here but they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m22s)

[actually wrote the function inside of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m25s)

[the interface which you can do now and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m27s)

[the analyzer doesn't take that into](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m30s)

[account and when you convert to the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m32s)

[concrete type you then can't invoke that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m33s)

[default interface](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m38s)

[member that was exciting um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m39s)

[so take that with a grain of salt](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m44s)

[uh or just don't use default interface](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m47s)

[members um which they are they are great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m51s)

[but they serve one very specific purpose](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m54s)

[and I feel like they get abused for a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m57s)

[lot of other purposes that they should](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h43m59s)

[not be used for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m01s)

[so in general I discourage](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m04s)

[them or at least I should say I I tell](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m08s)

[people not to use them unless they are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m10s)

[unless they can explain why they need it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m14s)

[right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m16s)

[like part of being a senior engineer is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m18s)

[learning how to say the phrase it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m21s)

[depends so if you want to be a senior](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m22s)

[engineer memorize that phrase and you're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m25s)

[halfway](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m27s)

[there because it is there are very few](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m29s)

[things that are black and white there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m33s)

[are guidelines and rules and the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m35s)

[important thing is knowing when should I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m37s)

[break them step one understand the rule](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m39s)

[and why it exists step two then find all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m43s)

[of the cases where you break it see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m45s)

[Angel Blade you got it you got it down](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m48s)

[you are halfway](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m50s)

[there see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m51s)

[bingo see we're going to have a whole](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m55s)

[team of senior engineers in here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m57s)

[shortly uh let's see so I think I might](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h44m59s)

[just write this one assert that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m02s)

[result uh let's see this is wanting to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m06s)

[assert that the result coming back is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m09s)

[solid color brush so is of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m11s)

[type is type](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m15s)

[of is this not a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m20s)

[generic ah there is a generic overload](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m23s)

[thank you i should just assume just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m25s)

[assume T units got my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m29s)

[back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m31s)

[boom does it return the does it return](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m33s)

[the the object that would be even cooler](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m37s)

[no that would be that would make my life](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m40s)

[too easy uh let's see here we're going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m43s)

[to go here we're going to bring this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m45s)

[down and we're going to just make you a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m47s)

[linear gradient](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m49s)

[brush boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m50s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m54s)

[okay so we might need to look at this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h45m57s)

[one here because I don't know what the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m01s)

[heck I messed up so rating bar let's say](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m03s)

[189 uh close you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m06s)

[uh oh that's the real](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m10s)

[one go down here collapse i'm going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m14s)

[just move you down i need more space i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m17s)

[need more space i've got my zoom set a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m20s)

[little big uh radiant bar](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m22s)

[tests in this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m26s)

[vicinity so what was it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m29s)

[before great so I broke this on my prior](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m35s)

[commit probably when I made a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m39s)

[checkpoint let's go back and look at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m43s)

[this uh yeah I saw the early PN here and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m47s)

[I'm like I I'm very confident I broke](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m51s)

[this when I did my mass find and replace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m55s)

[but I was just going to look and see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h46m58s)

[what it was before my find and replace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m00s)

[because I think that will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m03s)

[be ah okay so this is what it was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m07s)

[before copy change lines i I hope I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m13s)

[don't know when it says copy change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m17s)

[lines oh good it did copy what I wanted](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m19s)

[thank you get cracking you did what I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m22s)

[liked okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m24s)

[so I do like how it kind of mixed and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m26s)

[matched](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m29s)

[things thank you cutie have a good](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m31s)

[night and absolutely i'll catch you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m36s)

[later i I will uh see if I can drop in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m38s)

[on your streams for people who are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m41s)

[interested cutie if you want to drop a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m43s)

[link to your uh thing or if people want](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m44s)

[to just click on your name and jump over](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m46s)

[to it feel free to go give her a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m48s)

[follow uh okay so let's see here so we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m53s)

[were doing assertions that start point](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m56s)

[was zero](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h47m59s)

[and.5 okay so let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m01s)

[do await assert that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m04s)

[uh got to do it backwards i I got I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m12s)

[going to have to wrap my brain around it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m15s)

[assert that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m16s)

[uh is equal](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m19s)

[to new](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m22s)

[point and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m25s)

[z.5 yeah something like that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m27s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m33s)

[that and this is one and 0.5 and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m35s)

[end](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m40s)

[point and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m41s)

[then whack all that copy this because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m43s)

[I'm fairly confident I'm about to need](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m47s)

[it in the very next](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m48s)

[test kind of like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m50s)

[that zero and five one and five great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h48m54s)

[and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m01s)

[then we need that as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m03s)

[well yeah absolutely love my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m07s)

[T-Unit oh oh go co-pilot you are my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m11s)

[friend okay uh this might be another one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m16s)

[where I go and look up what it was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m20s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m26s)

[my Okay so this is uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m27s)

[230ish uh let's see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m33s)

[here copy change](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m41s)

[lines and then let's just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m44s)

[do paste so this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m47s)

[was this was verifying that the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m52s)

[offset wait is stop offset a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h49m57s)

[double oh good question engineering love](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m05s)

[yeah it so it's kind of weird so this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m08s)

[something that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m12s)

[is it is it is a it is a T-sync or or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m14s)

[T-sync let me try that again it is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m18s)

[T-Unit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m22s)

[idiosyncrasy of um the way they have set](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m23s)

[up their assertion libraries where](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m28s)

[everything is async](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m30s)

[now it's actually kind of clever i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m33s)

[uh let me go up here real quick](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m38s)

[right so this guy here if we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m41s)

[look it's not really async because it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m44s)

[asynchronous like it this might this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m49s)

[might take a a fun little bit to wrap](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m52s)

[the head around a little bit um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m54s)

[invocable](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h50m59s)

[the Yeah so this this is the uh Yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m03s)

[async is async is nice but there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m08s)

[there's an important thing to know about](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m10s)

[async is you can await anything that is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m12s)

[awaitable most of the time when people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m15s)

[learn um TPL async and await and C they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m18s)

[often they often get taught that what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m21s)

[you you return a task and you await your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m23s)

[task and that's true but there are other](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m25s)

[types that you can await as well value](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m29s)

[task is another one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m31s)

[um but just because something's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m33s)

[awaitable doesn't necessarily mean it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m37s)

[going to go async it's just that async](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m39s)

[and await are the language keywords so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m41s)

[this is the the base class of the thingy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m44s)

[being returned and you'll note it has a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m46s)

[get a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m49s)

[waiter any type that has a get a waiter](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m51s)

[meth uh a get a waiter method that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m54s)

[returns a type that has the appropriate](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h51m58s)

[signature of an awaiter again so this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m00s)

[all duct typing um which this guy does](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m03s)

[can be awaited so they've made their](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m08s)

[assertions awaitable for the purpose of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m11s)

[being able to abuse](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m14s)

[uh abuse the way the compiler is going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m18s)

[to do it to generate their assertion or](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m21s)

[to effectively generate the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m23s)

[um the the assertion chain inside of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m27s)

[here it it's very clever i I have so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m30s)

[even though these things are declared as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m35s)

[sync they aren't actually going as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m37s)

[sync and and I think most cases](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m42s)

[um because I'm I because I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m46s)

[where where it actually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m49s)

[uh and this looks recursive i would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m52s)

[probably have to pull their source code](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m54s)

[there's uh I I think the primary reason](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m56s)

[for doing this is being able to get the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h52m58s)

[information back as an expression](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m00s)

[um and by getting the information back I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m03s)

[mean getting the things that are the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m05s)

[expected and actuals back as an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m07s)

[expression which allows you to then um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m09s)

[generate very nice looking error](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m12s)

[messages on a failure now it's weird](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m14s)

[because they aren't passed in as](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m18s)

[expressions and so they're they they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m20s)

[this is 100% abusing newer C# language](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m23s)

[features to do things that other](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m26s)

[assertion libraries](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m28s)

[um don't do so yeah yeah async and await](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m31s)

[for validation interesting it is like at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m35s)

[some point I want to dig through their](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m38s)

[repository and look at it and fully](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m39s)

[understand how it's doing it but from](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m42s)

[looking at it initially that's appears](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m46s)

[to be the thing it's not actually going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m48s)

[async because I looked at this initially](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m50s)

[and went that seems horribly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m52s)

[inefficient but the the other thing to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m55s)

[know is async and await may not even in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h53m58s)

[real production code may not ever go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m01s)

[asynchronous if the task or the object](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m04s)

[returned from an awaited method is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m07s)

[already in a completed state the TPL has](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m09s)

[built-in logic to short circuit because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m13s)

[if the task is already completed why](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m14s)

[bother](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m17s)

[um actually doing threading stuff and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m18s)

[getting it going it's already completed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m21s)

[let's just grab that result and continue](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m23s)

[on it's much more efficient](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m25s)

[that's kind of functionally what's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m27s)

[getting abused here is there's not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m29s)

[there's not that actual um continuation](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m32s)

[it looked like in most cases it's just](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m35s)

[ripping through so it's it's a ve it's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m37s)

[weird setup completely agree and it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m40s)

[it's mildly obnoxious that on the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m43s)

[migration you have to then async task](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m45s)

[every single one of your tests](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m47s)

[um yeah they it is definitely using it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m50s)

[in a weird way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m54s)

[and this was one thing that I had](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m56s)

[considered because again I favor this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h54m59s)

[library being easy for people to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m02s)

[contribute to and I I worry a little bit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m04s)

[about async stuff because especially for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m08s)

[somebody who's potentially new to C](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m11s)

[async and await is really nice once you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m14s)

[know it but it can be intimidating and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m16s)

[difficult until you do and so it's like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m19s)

[there's but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m22s)

[it's my opinion currently sits at async](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m24s)

[and await is one where I would rather](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m28s)

[teach and elevate somebody who doesn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m30s)

[know it rather than dumbing it down to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m32s)

[to to meet that level right like there's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m34s)

[there's some give and take there of when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m36s)

[do you pull somebody up versus when do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m39s)

[you go maybe we dial this back down](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m41s)

[right and especially in an open source](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m44s)

[library where I'm I'm trying to make it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m47s)

[easy for people to contribute to it I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m49s)

[it's it's a balancing act and so I am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m52s)

[very open to feedback and critique if](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m56s)

[it's like this is this is too](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h55m58s)

[complicated for me to work with but at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m01s)

[least what I've seen for a lot of people](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m02s)

[coming to the project with async stuff](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m04s)

[even if they don't know async and await](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m07s)

[if the pattern's already laid out in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m09s)

[front of them they just replicate the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m11s)

[pattern in front of them and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m13s)

[everything everything just works it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m15s)

[like even if they don't know it I do the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m17s)

[pattern the compiler told me to this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m18s)

[what all the other tests are doing oh it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m21s)

[works great i'm done right so it's I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m22s)

[kind of thinking it's in that category](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m24s)

[see I usually have people do web](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m27s)

[requests with async and await when first](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m28s)

[introducing them to the concept yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m31s)

[that's a good one because you can pretty](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m32s)

[much guarantee that it's actually going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m35s)

[to go asynchronous on them without](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m37s)

[delay it's actually one that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m40s)

[is I I I've contemplated actually doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m44s)

[some PowerPoint slides for it like I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m47s)

[generally don't like teaching any coding](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m49s)

[stuff with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m52s)

[PowerPoint but for a handful of things I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m53s)

[I think it's actually nicer because then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h56m57s)

[you can you can actually kind of show](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m00s)

[the concurrency stuff happening and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m02s)

[what's going on behind the scenes it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m05s)

[always difficult to do that with real](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m07s)

[code and so I I think because uh the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m11s)

[company I work for we teach a C# class](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m14s)

[at a local university and I think the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m16s)

[homework assignment that we usually do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m18s)

[when we get around to having people do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m21s)

[um async and await stuff does do a web](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m24s)

[service call with HTTP client partly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m27s)

[because I think we also throw disposable](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m30s)

[at them and HTTP client is a nice](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m32s)

[curveball it's a dirty curveball but we](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m34s)

[tell them it in class so it favors the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m37s)

[students that show up to class and pay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m39s)

[attention](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m40s)

[yeah system IO is kind of pointless in a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m42s)

[lot of cases yeah and in some cases it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m44s)

[actually slower and and that's the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m46s)

[that's the weird part like a lot of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m49s)

[IO stuff got the async and await](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m50s)

[decorations on it around the Windows 8](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m52s)

[time frame um with the WinRT APIs and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m55s)

[all of that stuff coming into play](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h57m58s)

[and it it's it's not bad but yeah in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m01s)

[some modern hardware it can potentially](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m05s)

[be faster to just you know file write](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m07s)

[all text rather than doing any of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m10s)

[async stuff let's see do awaitable](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m11s)

[objects rec control to the event loop i](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m14s)

[don't know C# oh that is a Oh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m17s)

[engineering love you are asking a great](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m20s)

[question](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m22s)

[um yes I I'm going to say yes and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m24s)

[I'm going to put a huge asterisk next to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m28s)

[it and explain a little bit more um yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m29s)

[that is the intent so when you hit an uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m32s)

[and obviously these are bad examples but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m35s)

[when you see an await keyword in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m37s)

[C the intent being that this uh that the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m39s)

[thing to the right of it evaluates](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m43s)

[returns back an object that could be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m46s)

[awaitable and if it's not already](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m48s)

[completed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m50s)

[um control returns back um to the event](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m51s)

[loop and then once that object completes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m55s)

[uh it then continues on from this point](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h58m58s)

[forward so the compiler helps kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m00s)

[building up that state machine because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m02s)

[there's like I I just skimmed over a lot](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m04s)

[of details when I said it returns back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m06s)

[and starts executing here like there's a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m08s)

[lot that goes into that especially like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m10s)

[cancellation exception flow all of that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m12s)

[stuff is all kind of wrapped up in five](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m13s)

[little letters um so yeah but in general](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m16s)

[that's the intent is that the thing to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m20s)

[the arrived of await um is uh is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m22s)

[evaluated until it can return back that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m26s)

[awaitable object and I say evaluated](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m28s)

[that way because sometimes it'll invoke](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m30s)

[an async method and to get that object](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m33s)

[it has to execute the first half of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m36s)

[method to get the return to be awaited](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m37s)

[to come back to finish the second half](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m40s)

[of the method so a lot of times it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m41s)

[kind of like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m43s)

[that um but again if the object returned](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m45s)

[is already in a completed state it it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m48s)

[doesn't actually hand back control it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m50s)

[just can it goes nah this is already](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m52s)

[done i'm not going to I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m54s)

[return control come back and do all of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m56s)

[this context switching there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=02h59m58s)

[overhead in that i'm just going to keep](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m00s)

[executing it's much quicker so in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m01s)

[general yes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m04s)

[um yeah compilers do some some weird](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m07s)

[stuff yeah it's it's actually one of my](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m11s)

[favorite things to mention to people is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m14s)

[C is not always executed like your](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m17s)

[statements in C may not be executed in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m19s)

[the order that you write them](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m22s)

[like that always bothers people when I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m25s)

[go your the stuff you write may not be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m27s)

[executed in the order you write it and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m30s)

[like people's minds explode because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m32s)

[they're like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m34s)

[what now you probably never realize this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m36s)

[because the compiler is intelligent and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m41s)

[and has a pretty good idea of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m44s)

[dependencies between things and will not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m45s)

[reorder things um in a way that is uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m47s)

[detrimental right if it did we would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m51s)

[have bugs in C# all the time but there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m53s)

[are times especially in like loops where](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m56s)

[optimizations can be made by going you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h00m58s)

[know what if I actually increment this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m00s)

[thing first and then do the swap versus](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m02s)

[swap and then increment I can save](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m04s)

[myself some CPU instructions so usually](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m06s)

[it's at a lower level where functionally](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m08s)

[you can't tell in your code um and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m11s)

[especially in uh debug versus release](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m14s)

[builds right like debug builds in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m18s)

[general you're going to get what what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m19s)

[you have as stated um but again it's one](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m21s)

[of those things that it could happen for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m25s)

[fun you can look up memory barrier in C](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m27s)

[if you want to read all kinds of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m30s)

[exciting stuff about when you need a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m32s)

[memory barrier i have needed a memory](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m34s)

[barrier precisely once in my entire](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m36s)

[career of nearly two](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m40s)

[decades yeah almost two decades um and I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m44s)

[do some wacky C crap so as somebody who](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m48s)

[does wacky C stuff only ever needing the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m52s)

[feature once yeah it's like it never](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m55s)

[comes up it never comes up it's it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h01m58s)

[it's very very rare](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m00s)

[um yeah write program compile open in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m04s)

[net reflector dump code compare be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m08s)

[confused](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m10s)

[um yeah so in in this case these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m12s)

[awaits are always going to be in the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m17s)

[completed state already i I think what I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m20s)

[have seen inside of the TUNT code is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m24s)

[that the the returned objects from these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m26s)

[are always in the completed state and so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m28s)

[they functionally execute synchronously](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m31s)

[without ever doing any thread context](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m33s)

[switching and they're only here to abuse](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m35s)

[um a C feature known as expression trees](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m38s)

[to be able to get access to these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m41s)

[variables and gen real nice looking](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m43s)

[things i think again I haven't dove too](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m47s)

[deep into](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m49s)

[it yeah and angel blade it it does get](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m51s)

[interesting because C# is another weird](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m54s)

[one as well because like you dump](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h02m56s)

[code depending on how you compile the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m00s)

[code you are probably dumping is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m02s)

[probably IL intermediate language you'll](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m04s)

[see some people also reference it as uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m06s)

[MSIL is the old name Microsoft](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m08s)

[intermediate language or CIL common](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m10s)

[intermediate language um and it looks a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m13s)

[lot like if people have ever looked at](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m16s)

[like x86 assembly or similar it's not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m18s)

[too different from that but ILIL is not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m20s)

[quite assembly but it's close to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m24s)

[assembly so that the runtime can easily](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m26s)

[translate it to the needed um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m29s)

[architecture instructions when it gets](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m31s)

[there right but you can also compile C](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m34s)

[now AOT and go straight to um platform](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m37s)

[specific code immediately so that there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m42s)

[isn't that translation layer at runtime](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m44s)

[which is known as the JIT the just in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m47s)

[time compiler it's what takes your IL](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m49s)

[converts it to you know x64 ARM whatever](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m52s)

[you're running on which is how C# can](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m55s)

[compile for any CPU is it really can't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h03m57s)

[but it can compile to IL code and then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m01s)

[the runtime on the platform can convert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m03s)

[that I code to you know ARM x64 x86](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m05s)

[whatever right and so it gets you all](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m09s)

[the way there yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m12s)

[uh I love when people use const and they](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m15s)

[don't realize that the value is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m17s)

[generated at compile time Not runtime](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m18s)

[yeah yeah yeah like there and this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m24s)

[why like I don't know if you were here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m26s)

[at the beginning let me grab that link](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m29s)

[real quick uh Spokane.net user group um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m30s)

[I absolutely love all of this stuff and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m34s)

[find find it absolutely fascinating](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m37s)

[there is a I'm giving a user group talk](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m40s)

[uh first week in June uh the 3rd of June](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m44s)

[um this will be streamed via YouTube um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m48s)

[and if you miss it afterwards uh it will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m53s)

[be on Intellletch's YouTube channel so](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m56s)

[if you want to sign up to get the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h04m58s)

[YouTube link right away go to the meetup](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m00s)

[link and and join um otherwise if you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m03s)

[just search Intellletch on YouTube you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m06s)

[can find their channel and I'm sure I'll](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m07s)

[I will post links to it as well when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m09s)

[it's up um but I'm going to go through](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m11s)

[kind of the history of C because I think](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m14s)

[some of these C features it helps](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m16s)

[knowing that history to kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m19s)

[understand how we got here like even](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m21s)

[that idea of JIT versus AOT](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m24s)

[is like why why was that needed how did](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m27s)

[it how did it actually get all the way](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m31s)

[there like some of the reasons of why C](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m33s)

[is the way that it is is because of the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m36s)

[maturing thing um the maturing process](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m40s)

[over the years right like there was a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m43s)

[great quote I saw a couple weeks ago](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m46s)

[where it's and I'm probably going to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m47s)

[butcher it uh something along the lines](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m49s)

[of no complicated system just spawns](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m51s)

[effectively it starts from something](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m54s)

[simple and is built upon in layers and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m56s)

[slowly is built up right so small](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h05m59s)

[working layers added on top of each](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m02s)

[other is how you end up with a working](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m03s)

[complicated system it's rare that you go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m05s)

[from zero to big complicated working](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m07s)

[system and have it actually work right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m09s)

[like that's the idea of people biting](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m12s)

[off off of more than they can chew it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m14s)

[like no no no start small make it work](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m16s)

[then add on a little more make it work](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m18s)

[add on a little more make it work add on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m20s)

[a little more like and you can get](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m21s)

[yourself quite a a very big complicated](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m23s)

[system and it may seem simple when you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m26s)

[look at it at the end it's like oh I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m29s)

[could have built that from scratch is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m30s)

[like well it's remarkably difficult to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m31s)

[get all of the you know the cogs lined](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m33s)

[up and the teeth and the gears and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m35s)

[everything just so but if you started](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m37s)

[small it's actually not that bad right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m39s)

[it's almost like building one of those](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m43s)

[Lego sets right you follow the steps you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m44s)

[build the small pieces you put the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m46s)

[pieces together if you try to build it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m47s)

[from scratch you got to be one of their](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m49s)

[like master Lego builder](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m51s)

[people yeah if you are interested that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m53s)

[will be a very fun talk i honestly am](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h06m57s)

[struggling to figure](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m00s)

[out like I'm gonna have to move really](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m01s)

[quick because I plan on doing C# one to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m04s)

[C# 14 and I've got an hour that's like a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m06s)

[little over two minutes of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m11s)

[version i'm going to be going fast like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m13s)

[it's going to be C history the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m16s)

[highlights real](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m24s)

[yeah oh yeah pass with Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m25s)

[yeah yeah that is absolutely true](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m29s)

[engineering love and that's the thing is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m32s)

[like the so the my day job I work for a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m36s)

[lot of times where companies are like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m45s)

[yeah we want to use Kubernetes it's like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m46s)

[why do do you have a team that's going](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m49s)

[to support this because like Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m51s)

[is great and has insane power of what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m53s)

[you can do with it but you absolutely](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m56s)

[need at least a couple people that are](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h07m59s)

[whose job it is going to be to manage](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m02s)

[that crap for you like if you've got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m04s)

[that and you're willing to do that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m07s)

[investment great like you can get some](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m08s)

[cool stuff out of it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m10s)

[otherwise maybe not like it like it is a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m13s)

[rabbit hole and there is a lot there](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m16s)

[it's really cool and it's awesome it's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m18s)

[like I love standing up um the first](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m21s)

[project I did we were standing up a high](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m24s)

[availabil high availability system for a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m26s)

[a fintech company um and so multiple](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m29s)

[clusters multiple regions](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m33s)

[um data synchronization scaling peering](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m35s)

[in the V-netss together like it was it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m39s)

[was intense at one point in time we had](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m42s)

[a $20,000 Hello World application](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m44s)

[running um that was not good don't do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m46s)

[that that was But it was a really highly](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m49s)

[available Hello World](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m53s)

[application and it and it and it went](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m55s)

[burr which was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h08m58s)

[sweet i completely forgot what I was](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m02s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m05s)

[here right stop](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m06s)

[offset i'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m09s)

[surprised i'm surprised we have assert](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m17s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m21s)

[10 this is an this is an epsilon when](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m22s)

[you're doing double floatingoint](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m25s)

[comparison in xunit that's a very big](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m27s)

[epsilon for something that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m31s)

[one10enth yeah uh I need to expose GPU](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m37s)

[compute as a resource so Nvidia GPU K](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m40s)

[operator is the way to go plus handling](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m43s)

[multi-tenency and underlying AWS without](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m46s)

[Kubernetes would be far more painful](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m49s)

[100% agree based on that I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m50s)

[out on a limb and guess that this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m54s)

[some sort of AI](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m55s)

[project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h09m58s)

[that's like when I see Nvidia GPUs with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m00s)

[a K8 operator I'm I'm assuming this is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m03s)

[an AI project of some kind and one of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m05s)

[the purposes of running that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m08s)

[is you've got an LLM that you're doing](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m10s)

[something fun](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m14s)

[with i hope because that admittedly it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m15s)

[sounds kind of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m19s)

[cool uh it's a platform for ML pipelines](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m20s)

[yeah that sounds about right that sounds](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m24s)

[about right uh yeah like we've been](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m26s)

[building several](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m29s)

[uh um AI related projects and it is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m31s)

[like it is cool it is so awesome when it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m37s)

[works and it is shockingly difficult to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m41s)

[to to get all the pieces in line but](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m44s)

[yeah no that looks cool cool engineering](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m46s)

[love have you done much Kubernetes in](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m50s)

[the past or is this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m52s)

[uh is this a a new thing for you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h10m54s)

[um so I want I want to is close to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m01s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m08s)

[see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m10s)

[is equal to but I want a precision is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m15s)

[there a precision here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m20s)

[the quality](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m26s)

[compare not quite what I want i want a](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m28s)

[precision for the floating](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m31s)

[point is less](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m33s)

[than between](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m35s)

[default is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m39s)

[even like I could do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m43s)

[between just surprised there's not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m46s)

[a oh I think I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m52s)

[remember we got bit by this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h11m57s)

[four](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m01s)

[um I think I wrote one is close](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m05s)

[to Yeah uh let's see a fair bit but not](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m11s)

[a DevOps engineer i'll let you get back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m14s)

[to your Rick oh no don't don't feel bad](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m16s)

[at all i I I tell people on on this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m18s)

[stream I am very happy to rabbit trail](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m22s)

[it is I I come in with an idea of what I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m24s)

[want to work on but when people show up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m28s)

[with interesting things I will I will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m31s)

[absolutely run off the rails chasing it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m33s)

[um I could have sworn I wrote an is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m36s)

[close](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m39s)

[to Yeah this thing i did write it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m41s)

[crap i put it in a project that I can't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m47s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m52s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h12m59s)

[disappointing um where can I put](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m00s)

[it that it gets shared across to both of](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m04s)

[the I don't have a shared project](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m09s)

[between these](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m11s)

[uh Kubernetes my my game server rack](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m16s)

[wouldn't be too much without it yeah](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m19s)

[one of my colleagues when I think this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m23s)

[was like six or seven years ago in an](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m26s)

[effort to learn Kubernetes basically](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m29s)

[spun up a small cluster with a bunch he](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m31s)

[had a I don't know maybe half dozen](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m34s)

[Raspberry](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m36s)

[Pies and I think that was the moment](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m37s)

[like Kubernetes started to click for me](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m40s)

[of oh it's making more sense now because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m44s)

[it was shocking how much juice he got](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m48s)

[out of I think there were raspberry Pi](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m51s)

[twos or something it might have been](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m53s)

[threes i don't remember um but the](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m55s)

[amount that he was able to run on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h13m58s)

[it was shockingly high he say is like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m01s)

["Oh yeah I deployed out like this SMTP](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m05s)

[server i've got my web stuff." I'm like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m08s)

[it's like really like I've got a couple](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m10s)

[pies at home and if I put that much on](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m13s)

[them they like keel over cuz like I've](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m15s)

[got a a little retro pie for for gaming](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m18s)

[stuff and like a pie hole for um you](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m20s)

[know killing ads whatnot it's it's like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m23s)

[oh that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m26s)

[interesting okay I think what we're](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m30s)

[going to do is we're just going to copy](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m32s)

[paste because I don't see a a simpler](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m35s)

[path forward here and file linking would](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m37s)

[be better but I'm going to end up with](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m40s)

[biting name spaces and I don't want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m43s)

[deal with that right now so what I heard](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m45s)

[was copy paste change namespace](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m48s)

[done and then bippity boppity](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m51s)

[booya and what is your problem here](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h14m55s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m00s)

[see type devil cannot be used as type](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m02s)

[converter oh am I going to get Oh I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m07s)

[going to get hosed by](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m11s)

[frameworks oh I might get hosted by](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m16s)

[frameworks i picked up two of those uh](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m20s)

[PS5 XBF uh BC250 rack mount units 12](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m23s)

[nodes in each so 24 nodes total solid](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m26s)

[state storage on the network so I can](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m30s)

[mount and boot from](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m31s)

[Dang my system's not as cool as that](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m36s)

[no I moved back in September and](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m41s)

[unfortunately there's a reason I'm](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m45s)

[running a green screen behind me because](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m46s)

[I've got an unfinished basement behind](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m48s)

[me and well uh hopefully before the end](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m50s)

[of the year I I finished the remodeling](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m54s)

[and I have a really nice setup that's](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h15m57s)

[the plan we'll see we will](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m00s)

[see let's see with small number of nodes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m03s)

[you can trial and error and maximize](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m05s)

[resources with enough time on your hands](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m07s)

[solving the optimization problem for](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m09s)

[tons of nodes is impossible without](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m10s)

[something like Kubernetes yes yes](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m12s)

[absolutely](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m16s)

[absolutely o so what's biting me on this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m19s)

[is on this WPF test project this right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m24s)

[here net](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m27s)

[472 i am getting hosed because I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m31s)

[used features in this that don't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m35s)

[exist and caller argument expression](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m43s)

[that should be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m47s)

[available it must not be because you'll](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m49s)

[you'll note right up here right like](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m51s)

[like this is one of the easy ways to see](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m54s)

[this happen right if I go net](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m56s)

[8 some of these should then start](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h16m58s)

[lighting up](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m00s)

[or at least then](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m02s)

[work see so that that fixes that right](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m04s)

[but then if I go back](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m08s)

[here no](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m09s)

[bueno inaccessible due to its protection](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m12s)

[level what you're telling me it existed](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m14s)

[in 472 and they just hit](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m17s)

[it oh you Oh no this is a innumerable](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m21s)

[async process okay i was like what](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m25s)

[that's a Okay so one of my Nougat](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m27s)

[packages has it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m29s)

[internally that's That is annoying okay](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m31s)

[so this would need to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m35s)

[reimplemented this would need to be](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m40s)

[reimplemented i'm going to do](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m42s)

[this i'm going to comment this](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m45s)

[here i'm going to ignore it for now](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m49s)

[because I](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m52s)

[don't know how I want to handle that yet](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m54s)

[we're going to just pretend like it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m57s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h17m59s)

[exist and we'll come back to it](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h18m00s)

[and I want to think on it i want to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h18m05s)

[think on it and I've got more than](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h18m08s)

[enough errors to](https://youtu.be/nmVslxViF_4?t=03h18m09s)
