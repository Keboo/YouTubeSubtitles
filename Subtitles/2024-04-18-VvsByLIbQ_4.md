[between them because the lines are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h01m25s)

[okay so uh we are going to circle back](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m33s)

[um Nikolai has been doing um tons of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m35s)

[work around the smart hint there's a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m40s)

[couple outstanding questions Nikolai I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m42s)

[apologize I realize I said I was going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m44s)

[to get to you some of your questions](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m46s)

[before and that did quite happen so I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m48s)

[was going to take a look at this I was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m50s)

[also going to circle back down on this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m52s)

[numeric control so this is something](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m55s)

[that was submitted a ye long time ago](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h03m57s)

[um and it is a control that has been](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m00s)

[asked for multiple](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m03s)

[times um and one that I've needed myself](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m05s)

[in multiple apps and I've actually come](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m10s)

[across an instance where I would like it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m11s)

[again and so I was going to circle back](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m13s)

[to actually getting this thing rebased](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m16s)

[merged and added in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m18s)

[because this this Library isn't designed](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m21s)

[to be a control library but there are a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m23s)

[handful of things that I would argue are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m25s)

[almost](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m30s)

[Necessities um because the Alternatives](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m31s)

[is ret templating somebody else's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m33s)

[control or putting it in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m36s)

[box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m39s)

[and sometimes I don't trust the the work](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m41s)

[of other people's controls so you know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m43s)

[there's that so we'll take a look at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m44s)

[that the other thing I want to take a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m46s)

[look at is there was an issue that came](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h04m48s)

[relevant these are cleaning up from the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h08m09s)

[old property to the new generated stuff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h08m12s)

[which is even better we love](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h08m15s)

[at the point where I think I like it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m02s)

[more than the buil-in asserts for say](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m03s)

[xunit or Ms test or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m07s)

[handful of nice things um and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m14s)

[specifically the the way to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m17s)

[structure um failure messages is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m21s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m24s)

[nicer sometimes a lot nicer um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m25s)

[in its way of doing it sometimes being](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m30s)

[able to go through and just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m32s)

[have that cleaner](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m36s)

[failure or U more uh better](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m39s)

[lot of this dot should be like it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m49s)

[meant to read like a sentence so for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m52s)

[people who don't like long drawn out](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m54s)

[lines sometimes these lines end up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m57s)

[getting longer than the ones that were](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h09m59s)

[there before so there's a little bit of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m00s)

[that where it's like that feels](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m02s)

[yucky but I like my test to be big and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m06s)

[verbose so it's not that bad um the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m09s)

[other thing that gets weird is you'll](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m12s)

[note this should extension method is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m13s)

[literally on the base class object so it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m15s)

[shows up everywhere in your tests so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m18s)

[there's a little bit of that where it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m21s)

[like oh that feels that feels](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m22s)

[weird like that feels really weird](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m25s)

[so there's there's things like that but](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m30s)

[it also has these things like assertion](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m32s)

[Scopes right um where you can then like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m34s)

[batch up all of your failure like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m38s)

[there's little things like that where](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m40s)

[it's kind of nice like you don't need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m41s)

[these features often but when you do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m45s)

[they're kind like I don't know if I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m48s)

[would tell somebody go switch your](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m50s)

[library over to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m53s)

[this but if you were starting a brand](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m54s)

[contemplating putting this in to my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h10m58s)

[templates for new projects because I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m00s)

[kind of like it a little bit better than](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m03s)

[the the built-in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m05s)

[stuff a little bit again I don't think I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m07s)

[like it enough to say go switch a new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m11s)

[project over to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m13s)

[it's it it's kind of nice like it adds a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m18s)

[lot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m21s)

[of little things that are are kind of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m22s)

[convenient](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m26s)

[so yeah so for what it's worth if you're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m28s)

[comment look at the file as a whole](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m46s)

[basically I've made a duplicate test for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m48s)

[each of the existing tests in the class](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m50s)

[in order to mitigate the controls one by](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m52s)

[one as they adopt the smart hit approach](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m55s)

[the difference in height is typically](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m58s)

[around half to one pixel which is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h11m59s)

[basically a rounding a as far as I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m03s)

[concerned um but the test expected to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m05s)

[match down to the third decimal that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m08s)

[does not work and therefore I'm tempor](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m10s)

[introducing these overloads okay and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m12s)

[honestly I would even be okay getting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m14s)

[this thing down to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m17s)

[where it was within a pixel one one](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m19s)

[whole pixel because one whole pixel is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m23s)

[rounding a like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m26s)

[layout rounding is a thing um like we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m29s)

[talk about pixels as though they have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m33s)

[fractions pixels can't be like that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m34s)

[like saying half of a bit it's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m37s)

[really possible Right rendering things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m39s)

[do fancy fancy things to try to make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m42s)

[your eyes think that you get sub pixel](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m45s)

[rendering there is no concept of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m47s)

[something smaller than a pixel like you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m49s)

[get the pixel the pixel has a color and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m51s)

[that is it and there is fancy tricks on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m56s)

[how to use that color and and do magic](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h12m58s)

[with your eyes and whatnot but the end](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m00s)

[of the day every pixel on my screen has](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m03s)

[one color at a time that's it now I may](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m05s)

[have a lot of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m08s)

[pixels actually not really my monitors](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m09s)

[aren't that high res um I'm not running](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m11s)

[any 4K](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m14s)

[there are running like 8K displays and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m18s)

[are like crazy mode stuff but I am not I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m19s)

[am not that cool uh let's see the other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m24s)

[PRS adopting you'll see move from to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m27s)

[the uh Sam combo box where you can see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m30s)

[this happen once all Styles have adopted](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m33s)

[the new approach we can collapse into a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m36s)

[single test with the original name again](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m38s)

[uh please don't convert the zaml input](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m41s)

[to Raw string literals yet I will do it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m42s)

[post adoption or I clean up some of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m45s)

[leftovers](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m47s)

[okay I like I like how Nikolai instantly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m48s)

[assumed that I was going to go and tweak](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m51s)

[stuff because I can't resist thank you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m53s)

[Nick life I I probably would have gone](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m55s)

[and tweak stuff um because I just cannot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h13m57s)

[resist doing that thing um okay so we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m01s)

[going to look at this file here not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m05s)

[we're just going to collapse this we'll](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m09s)

[we'll just open that n BS what are we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m11s)

[looking at here uh this is generated](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m13s)

[test couldn't care](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m16s)

[less um and by couldn't care less what I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m18s)

[mean is if the generated test pass I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m21s)

[don't care to look at the content I only](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m23s)

[care if they fail let's see floating hit](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m25s)

[love being able to this makes me happy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m31s)

[the list pattern](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m32s)

[matching so so happy so so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m35s)

[happy um and then I think that may have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m40s)

[been the one that we edited last time](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m44s)

[the default](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m46s)

[visibility date in pattern match that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m48s)

[fine yeah I think I'd left these e at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m54s)

[one point there is an outstanding](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m56s)

[question question about doing XML docs](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h14m58s)

[like it would be nice to XML docs all](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m01s)

[the things and there's um dial cop stuff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m03s)

[you can turn on that will actually flag](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m06s)

[you if you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m08s)

[don't uh appropriately apply XML docs to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m09s)

[any public facing member some people](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m13s)

[turn that on I I have never turned it on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m15s)

[because it my opinion the bar for entry](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m18s)

[gets a little too high for the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m21s)

[library um and there's actually a kind](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m23s)

[of an ongoing debate with open source](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m27s)

[projects about whether whether you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m29s)

[should turn on all the analysis stuff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m32s)

[and increase that bar for entry because](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m35s)

[you want to make sure every PR that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m37s)

[comes in is of a a very high](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m39s)

[quality I for some projects I think that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m42s)

[makes sense I would rather people](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m45s)

[contribute lower value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m47s)

[PRS and allow and as long as they leave](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m50s)

[the Box checked where I can go in and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m53s)

[like push changes to it or similar or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m55s)

[worst case I'll just Branch off of their](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m57s)

[Branch if somebody's willing to get a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h15m59s)

[good at least most of the way there I'll](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m01s)

[carry it across the Finish Line right so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m04s)

[some libraries it doesn't make sense to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m07s)

[do that because it's like no I'm going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m09s)

[to get spammed with PRS some people are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m11s)

[blessed with tons of PRS uh this library](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m13s)

[is not and so I try to lower the bar for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m16s)

[entry as much as possible to make sure](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m18s)

[that if somebody wants to contribute I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m21s)

[want that to be easy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m24s)

[don't know if there's a lot I'm going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m32s)

[cat in this might be another one that we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m34s)

[look at in I don't think there's enough](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m36s)

[there okay so we've got two things I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m39s)

[want to go look at individually the text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m41s)

[field default hint and this one okay so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m44s)

[let's go here and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m46s)

[then uh yeah reset me to that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m50s)

[one thank you and then let's go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h16m54s)

[then so in case anybody wants to know it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h17m02s)

[uh you can go file uh open and file](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h17m05s)

[little bit this is this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h17m25s)

[big PR let's see so let's look at textt](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h17m28s)

[field default height](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h17m30s)

[able to look at these things kind of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m03s)

[side by side I'm going to show you a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m04s)

[this and we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m21s)

[go and now I've got my editor split](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m23s)

[between two places I can have the top](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m27s)

[bottom one looking like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m31s)

[this yeah buddy that's that's the way we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m33s)

[do it okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m37s)

[diffed out let me look at that diff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m56s)

[again real](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h18m58s)

[quick I think yeah so the idea here was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m02s)

[the old ones were taken out and then new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m06s)

[tests written so a new one for the uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m10s)

[text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m13s)

[box and then clearly combo box is in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m16s)

[progress](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m21s)

[and yeah and so this is is switching](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m26s)

[this across and again Nikolai if you're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m29s)

[watching I'm very okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m31s)

[if excuse me rather than Precision being](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m34s)

[three uh If This Were dialed down to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m37s)

[a uh just within a pixel I I'm honestly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m43s)

[okay with that I I think that is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m46s)

[probably close](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m49s)

[enough obviously exact matches would be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m52s)

[perfect but that's also kind of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m54s)

[unreasonable in a lot of cases okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m56s)

[height with floating hint](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h19m58s)

[style got it okay so these are these are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m01s)

[all going to end up looking real](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m03s)

[similar right so same same idea here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m05s)

[that one switches brings it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m11s)

[across I don't know why my visual studio](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m13s)

[has been losing its mind on its](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m16s)

[intelligence on these recent updates](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m19s)

[I've been playing with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m21s)

[um the the visual studio previews and it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m25s)

[has not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m28s)

[been not been](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m31s)

[uh been always working great for me okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m35s)

[so set here I'm just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m39s)

[gonna whoop bring that guy back up take](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m41s)

[back my whole Space because now that I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m44s)

[understand what these things are doing I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m46s)

[don't know if this is much to do here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m48s)

[and again this kind of assert true](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m50s)

[height greater than zero I I realize](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m52s)

[this is kind of a meaningless test at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m55s)

[the moment but in general uh you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h20m56s)

[do this is not oh see this is another](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m00s)

[thing like I want an assert greater then](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m03s)

[because an assert true if this fails you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m06s)

[don't get a good air](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m09s)

[message right you end up having to type](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m10s)

[it whereas that fluent assertions gives](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m12s)

[you a nicer air must it's little things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m14s)

[like that where it's like there's just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m16s)

[it's just a little bit nicer little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m19s)

[bit okay get element framework type](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m23s)

[clever use this forward slsh this is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m26s)

[zaml test syntax um one that I should](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m29s)

[probably document at some](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m33s)

[point](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m35s)

[um and honestly these asserts are now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m37s)

[kind of meaningless because get height](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m40s)

[is actually doing the assert inter](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m42s)

[internally](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m44s)

[so yeah it may be even worth renaming](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m48s)

[this to something like know assert](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m51s)

[height or something and then pull that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m53s)

[back so it's like okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m56s)

[cool okay so I'm good I'm good with that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h21m59s)

[I'm good with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m01s)

[that that that all makes sense and I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m03s)

[going to go give n a thumbs up on the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m06s)

[comment to let him know that that was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m09s)

[at I really shouldn't review his PRS](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m15s)

[early because I think he sometimes joins](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m17s)

[later in the Stream uh okay and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m19s)

[then uh we were going to look at the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m21s)

[theme text box was the other one that I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m24s)

[wanted to look at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m26s)

[Xbox](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m43s)

[okay yeah one key thing is a lot of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m45s)

[these resources are moving inside of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m48s)

[style rather than outside so we don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m50s)

[litter as much](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m52s)

[basically I I I kind of have been liking](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m55s)

[the sticky scroll by the way there are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h22m58s)

[I feel like I might need to change the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m01s)

[uh sticky scroll yeah maximum sticky](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m12s)

[lines now this view is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m15s)

[garbage absolute](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m19s)

[trash you'll note you can't read that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m22s)

[but I think we need to dial that down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m26s)

[because 20 20 lines up here like just to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m28s)

[be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m31s)

[clear 20 that's half my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m33s)

[screen in zaml you can get some fairly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m37s)

[deeply nested structures I don't think I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m40s)

[want 20 um okay so let's take a look](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m42s)

[here at what we got going on so collapse](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m45s)

[of visual State manager I don't think](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m49s)

[that's nearly as interesting outter](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m51s)

[border scroll viewer smart hint because](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m54s)

[this is where a lot of the extra m magic](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m57s)

[is coming into](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h23m59s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m00s)

[play inline horizontal offset and this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m02s)

[is this is where you get some of these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m05s)

[what look like absolutely wacky](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m08s)

[bindings](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m14s)

[but some degree they make perfect sense](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m17s)

[it's all of the massive inputs to be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m20s)

[able to make them line up and honestly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m22s)

[given how complicated this is I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m25s)

[surprised it's this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m27s)

[simple and honestly just given](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m32s)

[that that looks great like at the end of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m35s)

[the day what really matters is launching](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m38s)

[the uh the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m41s)

[demo and seeing it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m44s)

[work because I could I can stare at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m46s)

[those you know nine or 10](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m48s)

[bindings and it's it's difficult to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m51s)

[determine whether they're functioning](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m54s)

[properly obviously those UI tests are a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m56s)

[key factor making sure that they work I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h24m59s)

[do love it when there's a particular bit](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m02s)

[of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m05s)

[functionality and you launch the app at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m06s)

[the end just to sort of make sure](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m09s)

[everything's working but not really](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m11s)

[stressing about it because your test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m13s)

[passed therefore it must be working yeah](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m16s)

[and I think this this also fixed what we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m19s)

[had last time because there was one of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m21s)

[the defaults from the the last bit of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m24s)

[feedback that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m27s)

[that I had sent Nikolai was the the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m28s)

[prefix wasn't showing up until you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m31s)

[started typing which was very jarring](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m33s)

[like I don't mind the jump when focus is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m35s)

[moving in but it was weird having focus](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m38s)

[in there moving uh to type and then](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m41s)

[seeing your bar jump a little bit](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m43s)

[it I I think this this feels a lot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m47s)

[nicer this feels a lot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m51s)

[nicer this already makes me very very](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m55s)

[happy like the fact that we can do this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m57s)

[with the hint is remarkably difficult I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h25m59s)

[am](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m02s)

[noticing that hint isn't lined up well I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m05s)

[don't think password box is expected to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m08s)

[be working let's pick on the text box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m10s)

[see that's better right so the big](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m13s)

[difference here that text is lined right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m16s)

[up in the middle of the line the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m19s)

[password box down below which I I don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m20s)

[believe is actually expected to be done](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m23s)

[yet right you can see how the Middle](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m25s)

[Line run runs up high on the on the text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m27s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m31s)

[problematic so don't do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m32s)

[that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m34s)

[um yeah and I think the date picker was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m36s)

[another one that I know uh Nikolai was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m39s)

[looking at didn't realize the time](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m42s)

[picker we didn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m44s)

[have outline styles for that seems weird](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m45s)

[to not have a matching style but](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m49s)

[Nikolai often will make these um these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m53s)

[pages to show off the the the breadth of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m56s)

[it which is is rather nice okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h26m59s)

[cool I'm going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m04s)

[to mark this here and I'm going to put](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m06s)

[an approve on here because in its](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m09s)

[current state I would](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m11s)

[be I I would be very happy to let that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m13s)

[merge but we'll we'll see where that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m17s)

[goes and then let's look at while we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m19s)

[in it because this is a PR doing the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m22s)

[combo box in to that same uh PR](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m24s)

[Branch right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m29s)

[so uh the intention was to document what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m31s)

[it takes to to adopt the new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m34s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m37s)

[um and it also aligns the combo box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m38s)

[style to match the layout in the tech](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m41s)

[box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m42s)

[better uh okay so let's take a look I am](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m44s)

[curious to to understand this so that we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m48s)

[don't care about this is the demo app](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m51s)

[we're just going to look at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m54s)

[that and then these these are the UI](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h27m56s)

[tests think I care as much since I know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m00s)

[they passed Genera file don't care](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m02s)

[inverter deleted don't care though I do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m07s)

[care a little bit oh this is internal so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m09s)

[I don't care we can delete internal](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m13s)

[stuff uh let's see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m17s)

[here so slick with love it I love it I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m19s)

[love the list pattern matching](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m23s)

[though okay so this this is one that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m31s)

[interests](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m33s)

[me this is at like I get why this isn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m34s)

[a list pattern](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m38s)

[match I think you can get I I think](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m39s)

[there's a way to do this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m41s)

[though trying to think because the issue](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m44s)

[here is wanting to say I want a length](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m48s)

[greater than](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m49s)

[two but I don't actually care about the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m51s)

[first or uh the first two elements but I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m54s)

[want to make sure the third element is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h28m58s)

[Bool that is equal to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m01s)

[false like there's subtly a bit of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m03s)

[boxing that's going on here because you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m06s)

[can see values here right is an object](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m08s)

[array and so this is false](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m10s)

[is effectively doing a uh boxing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m14s)

[operation on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m18s)

[it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m20s)

[yeah oh and you kind of already matched](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m26s)

[the pattern out of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m28s)

[here oh interesting because these here's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m31s)

[your first two interesting okay whatever](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m34s)

[it's it's a it's a complicated thing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m37s)

[trying to get clever with the pattern](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m40s)

[match is probably only going to make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m41s)

[things worse generated file don't care](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m43s)

[let's see uh theme generated file don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m46s)

[really care a the only thing I want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m49s)

[see is what these things are wrapped](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m51s)

[inside of actually we'll get that from](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m53s)

[the Json file um these names are a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m54s)

[little generic and I'm curious what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m57s)

[they're underneath just to to see uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h29m59s)

[generate file don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m03s)

[care uh large diff we'll take a look at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m05s)

[uh that's also generated that's also](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m09s)

[generated uh that's a white space change](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m13s)

[okay so here are the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m16s)

[interesting okay so brush foreground we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m19s)

[are adding in some alternate keys for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m23s)

[the same foreground brush](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m25s)

[and okay so that seems](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m30s)

[fine combo box okay so the the border](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m32s)

[and outline border these are actually](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m35s)

[nested underneath the appropriate](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m36s)

[control types that looks great perfect](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m38s)

[perfect perfect okay so we have combo](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m40s)

[box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m42s)

[here and this is probably one that will](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m43s)

[be easier to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m47s)

[review in Visual Studio but we'll see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m49s)

[here so we bring the inverter inside the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m52s)

[template great](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m56s)

[bring the focus style inside of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h30m58s)

[parent style great same with all of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m00s)

[other converters Nest them](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m02s)

[underneath](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m05s)

[um template bindings to pull those](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m08s)

[in seems](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m12s)

[fine pack icon what I'm really looking](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m17s)

[for is wherever that smart H text Bo or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m19s)

[control itself there's the smart hint](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m32s)

[which is where all of the interesting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m36s)

[new stuff is happening oh I did](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m37s)

[something the other day](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m40s)

[G11 in case anyway](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m53s)

[okay and these are what look to be very](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h31m58s)

[similar bindings for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m01s)

[care and make it smaller](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m24s)

[not completely small because a lot of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m28s)

[this stuff was changed and moved around](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m30s)

[like it bothers me that these things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m33s)

[aren't set but it looks mostly like a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m36s)

[reordering to me uh let's see is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m38s)

[keyboard Focus again some of these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h32m41s)

[quick look at this one and then I think](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m06s)

[we're going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m08s)

[to check out](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m10s)

[PR um and then I think what we're going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m13s)

[to do is take a look at adding in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m16s)

[numeric up down control uh let's see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m18s)

[here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m21s)

[another project okay let's fire the demo](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m40s)

[app up and take a look at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m42s)

[this also the really cool let me see if](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m47s)

[I can find it real quick let me see if I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m50s)

[can find](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m53s)

[it so I know I've teased like the um my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h33m56s)

[and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m03s)

[similar uh let's see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m04s)

[great um but a part of velop Pac](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m09s)

[is uh using net](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m13s)

[Aspire uh which if you haven't seen net](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m16s)

[Aspire lots of sessions at the build](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m19s)

[mine um I need to look and see I don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m45s)

[remember if they](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m48s)

[are going to try to live stream or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m51s)

[record this I think the intent is yes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m54s)

[but I don't remember](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h34m57s)

[um so if you're at all interested feel](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m00s)

[free to sign up because knowing how many](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m03s)

[people are interested definitely makes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m05s)

[the decision about hey do we record SL](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m07s)

[Liv stream this a bigger deal so if you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m10s)

[are interested in that sign up uh drop a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m13s)

[comment on there um and see it's going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m16s)

[to be a good one I Joshua's worked with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m19s)

[me a bunch on the velop PAC stuff and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m21s)

[using net Aspire I converted him I I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m23s)

[believe his exact words where uh I now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m26s)

[want to use it for all my projects so it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m29s)

[can't be that bad now can it so you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m32s)

[don't know what it is watch this that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m34s)

[should](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m36s)

[be um short version cloud](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m38s)

[computing makes makes lots of things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m41s)

[easier pretty dashboards cool logging](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m43s)

[fully](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m47s)

[customizable more buzzwords here uh okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m49s)

[combo box demo app](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m52s)

[okay let's go down here password box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m55s)

[password box combo box style so these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h35m59s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m02s)

[here and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m03s)

[honestly that's the one I'm most](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m07s)

[interested in I am a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m09s)

[curious that looks a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m12s)

[low](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m14s)

[um can you do a stream on vpac yes yes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m16s)

[yes yes 100% yes um I'm trying to decide](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m19s)

[so is he uh let me know would you be so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m24s)

[there there's two parts to velop Pac](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m29s)

[there's the the SDK and the tooling](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m32s)

[which is free and open source and it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m35s)

[will get you an installer very quickly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m37s)

[and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m40s)

[easily um the problem is is that's where](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m41s)

[it ends and you're kind of on your own](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m44s)

[for hosting there's some helpful things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m47s)

[about like posting to GitHub releases or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m49s)

[an S3 bucket or similar but the the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m51s)

[tooling itself is there but it kind of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m55s)

[just says great you've got an installer](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m57s)

[you figure out how to host it the thing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h36m59s)

[that I was kind of dragging my feet on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m02s)

[that I was uh contemplating waiting on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m04s)

[for demoing it was showing showing what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m08s)

[we are calling velop Pac flow which is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m13s)

[the the SAS offering that we that we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m16s)

[looking to to host so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m19s)

[that sorry I'm just looking at this a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m23s)

[little bit there's a small difference](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m25s)

[here in O in in where the floating hint](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m27s)

[goes um but velop Pac flow is the SAS](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m32s)

[offering that handles all of the hosting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m35s)

[for you that way you could run a net](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m37s)

[publish and you're done now that's a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m40s)

[little tongue and- cheek because there's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m44s)

[a little bit of setup that goes along](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m46s)

[with that right like you have to log in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m47s)

[and have an account and that kind of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m49s)

[thing but you can get it down to posting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m51s)

[or release is as fast as a net publish](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m54s)

[command will will get you which is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m57s)

[really slick really slick and um and it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h37m59s)

[will definitely kill off your your Wicks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m03s)

[installers there are a handful of things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m05s)

[I will mention because it was originally](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m08s)

[based on the squirrel installer it is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m11s)

[designed to install quick and easy to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m13s)

[the users's profile stuff right we've](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m17s)

[got we've got some future enhancements](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m20s)

[that we want to do to start adding in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m24s)

[what people would consider](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m26s)

[um a more normal installer experience](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m28s)

[for example because right now you don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m31s)

[really prompt the user to take in input](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m33s)

[or similar um it's designed to just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m35s)

[install really bloody fast which is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m38s)

[great but then people want different](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m42s)

[customization so just be aware that what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m44s)

[Wix allows is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m46s)

[universe what velop Pac allows is much](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m49s)

[smaller but typically what people care](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m52s)

[about is install my app you know maybe](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m54s)

[maybe I want to uh create some shortcuts](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m57s)

[or whatnot because those are important](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h38m59s)

[so that it shows up in the start menu or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m01s)

[desktop or whatever um and then I want](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m03s)

[to have automatic updates and all of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m06s)

[that framework kind of in place and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m08s)

[ready to go great if that's what you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m09s)

[want it'll fit the bill](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m11s)

[awesome um okay sorry the one thing I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m13s)

[noticed on these combo boxes the hint](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m17s)

[position is a little different right and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m20s)

[I I realize this is one of those things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m23s)

[that's hard to see right so if we go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m25s)

[here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m27s)

[right I'm going to do this very small](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m28s)

[you can see the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m30s)

[pixels if I do if I do I'm going to try](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m32s)

[to draw a flat line I am just so zoomed](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m36s)

[in my mouse is we're going to dial down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m38s)

[my sensitivity a little bit my mouse is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m40s)

[a little touchy right now okay so we can](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m42s)

[see that the middle bar of the H is in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m45s)

[line with the bottom of the outline](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m47s)

[color](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m49s)

[right okay that's the combo box we go up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m51s)

[to the text box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m54s)

[right and we do the same](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h39m57s)

[thing right we can](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m00s)

[see that they're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m03s)

[off and this this might be one of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m05s)

[things that Nikolai was commenting of of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m08s)

[off by a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m10s)

[pixel does it matter not really but it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m14s)

[is a difference and it was enough that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m18s)

[it caught my eye I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m20s)

[matters that much I don't know if they](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m22s)

[were side by side maybe it would be a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m23s)

[little more obnoxious but it's it's a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m25s)

[very minor thing see all I need is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m26s)

[silent installer with some custom config](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m28s)

[files and firewall settings okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m31s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m33s)

[so for your config files are those just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m36s)

[artifacts files that just get deployed](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m40s)

[alongside your](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m42s)

[application um and the firewall settings](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m44s)

[there's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m47s)

[currently there's not currently](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m48s)

[installer support for doing firewall](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m50s)

[settings what it does provide however is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m52s)

[a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m56s)

[going to show this off real quick](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m58s)

[because why not why not okay so if we go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h40m59s)

[Bop Pac](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m05s)

[iio uh let's see integrating app hooks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m07s)

[so what is uh where is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m11s)

[this uh where's the call](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m16s)

[back code yeah so these guys here so you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m19s)

[do get these types of hooks available](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m24s)

[yeah with a bit of text Replacements](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m27s)

[okay so if if all you need is the files](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m29s)

[bundled up the source file for velop Pac](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m32s)

[is a nougat](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m35s)

[package and there's a big asteris next](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m36s)

[to that it doesn't need to be a nougat](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m40s)

[package the only thing the nougat](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m42s)

[package is is a ZIP file with a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m43s)

[well-defined manifest that we could use](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m45s)

[any zip file with a well-defined](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m48s)

[manifest it just so happens that nougat](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m50s)

[packages there was a lot of tooling](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m52s)

[already built around them so we just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m54s)

[kind of Abus that right so short version](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m55s)

[the deployment artifact is a ZIP file](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h41m59s)

[with a manifest inside of it that's it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m01s)

[right so as La so if your config](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m04s)

[files are put into your your output](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m07s)

[directory like alongside your app great](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m10s)

[you're good to go not not hard right and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m13s)

[if you need to do some customizations](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m15s)

[you can do like a net build run whatever](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m18s)

[or I guess you can do a net publish make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m21s)

[whatever changes you need to and then do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m24s)

[the velop pack publish if you need to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m27s)

[separate those two steps because you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m29s)

[need to do something in the middle right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m30s)

[that's a possibility but you do get](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m32s)

[these call back hooks so to some degree](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m34s)

[custom things like potentially firewall](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m36s)

[settings are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m38s)

[similar um you it and again there comes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m40s)

[to be a question of should your app be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m44s)

[able to to make these changes right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m46s)

[because sometimes making those changes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m49s)

[requires elevation your app is not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m51s)

[designed to run with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m53s)

[elevation those types of problems](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m54s)

[but for some customizations these hooks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h42m57s)

[work well for people firewall firewall](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m00s)

[settings may or may not be a good](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m04s)

[candidate um but I'm going to make a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m08s)

[quick note of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m11s)

[that for our](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m12s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m15s)

[um and actually one other thing I will](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m17s)

[point out uh where is our if you if you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m20s)

[are interested to um so one one](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m24s)

[vac. um and then if you've got questions](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m28s)

[uh jump into the the Discord chat I have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m32s)

[been trying to pay attention to it but](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m36s)

[honestly I've got so many notifications](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m38s)

[popping up I I yeah um however my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m40s)

[partner kayin who I will argue knows the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m44s)

[SDK significantly better than myself](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m47s)

[mostly because he wrote most of it um uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m50s)

[is very active in there and has been](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m54s)

[helping people through questions so drop](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m57s)

[a drop a line in there um let them know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h43m59s)

[that you came from my stream](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m02s)

[and uh and let them know that uh wanting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m05s)

[the firewall settings would be a nice](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m08s)

[addition for use cases because we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m11s)

[trying to collect what people need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m13s)

[because obviously with an installer](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m15s)

[people want the massive power of Wicks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m17s)

[and we probably are not going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m21s)

[implement the massive power of Wix like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m22s)

[there's just too much there but for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m25s)

[common use cases we want to start making](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m27s)

[it to where it can be an easy an easy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m30s)

[yes of oh of course you can you can you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m32s)

[know set firewall settings here's how](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m35s)

[you do it because this is designed to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m37s)

[try to be an easy installer right we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m39s)

[not going to expose the full power of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m42s)

[everything because at a certain point if](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m44s)

[you need huge amounts of customizations](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m46s)

[we're not the right solution for you you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m49s)

[probably need to build something special](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m51s)

[but most people don't need don't need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m53s)

[much most people are just like I want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m55s)

[get get my app onto my users machines I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m56s)

[don't want to think too hard so okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h44m58s)

[cool and honestly you know what we we we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m03s)

[we might even just go and play with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m06s)

[that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m08s)

[um yeah because I I've actually been](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m09s)

[contemplating once we get the the velop](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m12s)

[Pack Flow stuff going I may move our](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m14s)

[demo app over to deploying with it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m16s)

[because right now it's hard for people](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m19s)

[there's the pre-compiled binaries that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m22s)

[people can download and run but I'm like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m24s)

[you know what it would be really](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m26s)

[nice if I could push updates to to the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m28s)

[to the demo app like because sometimes I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m31s)

[push a release and then I realize ah](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m33s)

[shoot you know the demo app had](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m34s)

[something wrong it'd be nice to just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m36s)

[push it right be real slick real slick](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m38s)

[uh oh cool how did the uh 5 upgrade go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m43s)

[any any major problems were the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m46s)

[migration docks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m49s)

[sufficient I guess are the big big](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m51s)

[questions because if there were if there](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m54s)

[were problems would love to address](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m56s)

[those okay so the combo box looks good](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h45m59s)

[um I'm going to leave](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m02s)

[one only one minor comment the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m04s)

[positioning of the floing hint on the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m11s)

[outline style appears to be one pixel](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m15s)

[lower on the box stle](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m21s)

[not a big](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m27s)

[deal did catch my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m30s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m34s)

[eye okay we'll do that do that okay so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m39s)

[uh had to use the shim for two solutions](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m44s)

[uh but I think that is because of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m47s)

[extensions oh you're using the material](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m52s)

[design extensions Library](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m55s)

[that is very that is very likely there](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m57s)

[there's a number of places where things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h46m59s)

[that were built on material design are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m02s)

[probably going to be broken because of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m05s)

[my my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m07s)

[changes specifically anything that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m11s)

[going to end up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m13s)

[using](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m15s)

[um the like the dynamic resources okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m18s)

[we're going to try something hard first](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m21s)

[of all which files are touched by this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m24s)

[we're we're going to show we're going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m26s)

[show how to do Insane things with Git](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m28s)

[here in a minute okay so couple things I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m30s)

[only care about a few things here so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m33s)

[we've got we've got the we've got the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m35s)

[user control this is the key file we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m37s)

[want to keep right this is a brand new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m39s)

[file not likely have conflicts we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m42s)

[good right generics uh. zaml probably](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m44s)

[conflicts right but it's one line not a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m48s)

[big deal okay great this one this is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m52s)

[the style and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m55s)

[um and the look I realized I typed the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h47m57s)

[word Matt Blazer instead of mud Blazer](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m01s)

[that was dumb of me](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m03s)

[um yeah we might we might go with a I I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m07s)

[think we might do a slightly cleaner we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m10s)

[we might change the look of this a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m13s)

[little bit but whatever right so we've](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m14s)

[got we've got this right and then we've](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m16s)

[got um we've got these demo app ones](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m19s)

[right so this is a new file not likely](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m23s)

[to be a conflict new file not likely to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m25s)

[be a conflict existing file maybe a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m27s)

[conflict we'll see I don't know how many](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m31s)

[how](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m33s)

[many I don't know how many new pages](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m34s)

[we've added this might cause us a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m36s)

[problem okay but I will also point out](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m38s)

[these commits were done in April 25th of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m41s)

[old uh let's see I'm looking to make a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m50s)

[form and update it a bit uh maybe use a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m53s)

[sage of ground for possibly some](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h48m57s)

[V okay so we're going to go here we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m12s)

[going to go here and then step one close](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m15s)

[Visual Studio because Visual Studio is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m18s)

[not going to like what I'm about to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m20s)

[okay right click and we're going to so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m22s)

[this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m26s)

[again I absolutely love get cracked for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m27s)

[this right so if you you click on the pr](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m29s)

[you can kind of review it and do all](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m31s)

[this stuff and blah blah blah right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m33s)

[you've got you've got this adders remote](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m35s)

[and all that stuff but secretly down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m37s)

[here we've got this add remote and check](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m40s)

[out](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m43s)

[Branch perfect that's exactly what I'd](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m45s)

[like to do add remote check out Branch](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m47s)

[bipp](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m49s)

[booah so it does the needful and I now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m51s)

[I'm back here right and so you'll note](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m54s)

[the last change on here was some minor](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m57s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h49m59s)

[from a live stream that apparently I did](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m00s)

[again almost almost a year ago](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m04s)

[right right okay kind of liking myself](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m07s)

[in the bottom left hand corner I my big](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m10s)

[head covers up less I I may move it when](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m12s)

[we get to coding but at least here it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m14s)

[seems like I'm less in the way maybe I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m17s)

[should stay over](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m19s)

[here yeah we'll see how it goes we'll](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m21s)

[see we'll see we'll see who knows Okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m23s)

[so step one we would like to be not in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m26s)

[last year we would like to be in this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m29s)

[year because this year is cooler than](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m31s)

[last year and oh dear Heavens I have way](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m33s)

[too many branches I need to clean up my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m35s)

[Branch](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m38s)

[list I I I got](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m39s)

[aund 20 no 32o I was like wow that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m42s)

[terrified for a moment okay so normally](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m46s)

[I would take this the this guy here and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m49s)

[drag it on top of the branch that I want](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m52s)

[to uh rebase onto there there's a bit of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m54s)

[an issue with that in that it's way up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h50m57s)

[there like way up there so we're going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m01s)

[to come over here and I'm going to right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m03s)

[click so you'll note that I did pull](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m05s)

[pull my master as well just to make sure](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m06s)

[that it was my local master was in sync](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m09s)

[with my remote Master right so if I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m11s)

[rightclick here what we're going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m14s)

[do do an interactive rebase um I think](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m17s)

[we're going to end up keeping everything](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m21s)

[here so it we interactive was not really](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m23s)

[necessary versus a regular one but](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m27s)

[sometimes it's worth looking holy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m29s)

[cow yeah I lied uh I said this was going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m32s)

[to be an interesting uh rebase](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m35s)

[apparently it's just going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m37s)

[work uh that's utterly terrifying okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m40s)

[so let's rock and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m44s)

[roll because clearly I have Push](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m48s)

[permissions because I pushed to this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m51s)

[last](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m52s)

[time okay I just got to remember my big](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m53s)

[head is over this this corner now so I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m55s)

[start talking about something in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m58s)

[bottom left somebody yell at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h51m59s)

[me okay so step one let's fire the demo](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m01s)

[app up and let's take a look](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m05s)

[at this new control and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m09s)

[see see what it looks like I I just want](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m12s)

[to make sure it works Visual Studio has](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m15s)

[to spend a minute rebuilding the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m17s)

[universe because we just rebased its](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m19s)

[world and it lost its mind going ah you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m21s)

[time](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m24s)

[traveled we did that's what makes it fun](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m25s)

[okay so if I do here numeric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m29s)

[down okay so we got this got](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m32s)

[this okay more or less Works more or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m35s)

[less works okay I do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m38s)

[think and we're going to go let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m40s)

[go go here um material design components](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m44s)

[boom I would like to go in here I don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m50s)

[think there's a numeric up down control](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m52s)

[but I just want to confirm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m55s)

[that before I get too carried](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h52m57s)

[away um because if there if there is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m03s)

[some prior art to base this on I would](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m06s)

[like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m09s)

[to mirror that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m11s)

[behavior it doesn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m15s)

[look like there is this is a common](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m17s)

[enough control that we can find other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m20s)

[material design libraries this is one of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m23s)

[those areas that people get confused](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m25s)

[about is they'll they'll look at a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m27s)

[particular material design](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m29s)

[implementation and go oh that must match](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m30s)

[the spec that's not true um every](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m33s)

[material design implementation out there](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m36s)

[including Google's deviates from the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m39s)

[spec somewhere for something on some app](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m40s)

[so just know that it takes it with a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m45s)

[great of salt because often times people](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m46s)

[go why don't you implement this great](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m48s)

[control that I found in some other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m49s)

[material design Library it's like well](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m51s)

[if it's not in this list it's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m53s)

[actually one of Google Googles which](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m55s)

[means I don't feel a huge urge to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h53m58s)

[implement it and so there has to be a a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m00s)

[genuine a genuine need I will say this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m04s)

[though if somebody else wants to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m07s)

[through the effort of building the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m09s)

[custom control and submitting a PR I am](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m10s)

[I am happy to look at accepting them](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m13s)

[because the maintenance of a control is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m15s)

[not nearly as big as the creation of one](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m18s)

[at least in my opinion so if somebody](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m22s)

[actually goes through the effort of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m24s)

[creating one I'm I'm happy to get those](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m26s)

[in and there's a number of the custom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m28s)

[controls that have gotten into the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m30s)

[library by going that route so just know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m32s)

[that if you want you want a custom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m35s)

[control in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m36s)

[library all you have to do is implement](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m38s)

[it and again as long as it's implemented](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m40s)

[well heck is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m42s)

[this I'm on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m45s)

[search uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m49s)

[Google there okay thank you that was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m52s)

[weird](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h54m55s)

[um yeah and some some controls just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m00s)

[don't make sense inside of WPF land and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m03s)

[we're not likely to ever Implement](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m06s)

[them so it would be nice to have this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m10s)

[Rich tool tip at some](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m12s)

[point um which is basically a pop-up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m14s)

[control it like more or less how it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m17s)

[would get implemented probably okay so I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m21s)

[don't see any good prior art to base](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m24s)

[this on so I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m26s)

[think close a couple of these down I I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m29s)

[think what we are going to look at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m33s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m35s)

[is uh let's see I realize this was bad I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m39s)

[I think I kind of like the the mud](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m44s)

[Blazer](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m46s)

[approach I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m49s)

[think it seems simple](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m51s)

[enough now there's there's there's some](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m54s)

[weirdness going on here that I'm not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m57s)

[sure I like so you'll note when I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h55m58s)

[tapping on this the the ripple effect is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m01s)

[on the entire](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m04s)

[area that may or may not be a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m08s)

[useful](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m12s)

[thing but I I I think I I think we like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m16s)

[this let's check out some of the others](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m19s)

[uh okay so there's that would be nice to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m21s)

[put a few more examples showing command](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m24s)

[min max and other styles okay so the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m26s)

[demo needs to be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m28s)

[um and then we've got](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m32s)

[some for commands we should create a new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m35s)

[dependency](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m38s)

[property yeah so this looks like it is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m39s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m42s)

[probably I command or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m46s)

[similar yeah and these ones here here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m50s)

[are some examples what we usually see in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m53s)

[the UI plus minus plus Min and I can see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m54s)

[going with the side by side approach I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h56m57s)

[tempted to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m00s)

[implement honestly the side by side](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m01s)

[might might even be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m04s)

[easier but let's let's let's let's dive](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m07s)

[in and take a look at this guy okay so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m10s)

[numeric up down control](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m13s)

[um it'd be cool to get this guy going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m16s)

[it'd be cool to get this guy going okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m19s)

[so we want to look](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m22s)

[at event value changed so this should be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m24s)

[a routed event bubbling good that's fine](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m27s)

[dependency properties men Max okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m32s)

[here's the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m35s)

[commands](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m39s)

[a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m41s)

[comment I hate it when you leave a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m44s)

[comment you don't remember what you were](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m46s)

[thinking from a year](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m47s)

[ago uh for the commands we should create](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m49s)

[a new new dependency properties for the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m51s)

[command](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m53s)

[parameters oh the the command parameters](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m54s)

[are what are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h57m58s)

[missing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m01s)

[um right because this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m07s)

[passing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m11s)

[null does that make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m15s)

[sense does that make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m23s)

[I'm now questioning current Kevin is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m27s)

[questioning what past Kevin was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m29s)

[thinking uh let's see we're just GNA](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m31s)

[fres and body a couple of these things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m34s)

[because C you know has had a a major](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m35s)

[version release since the last time we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m39s)

[looked at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m41s)

[this okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m43s)

[so Mouse](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m45s)

[wheel I think I want to offer an option](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m48s)

[for disabling this because this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m51s)

[definitely one of those behavor avors](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m54s)

[that should probably not be on only](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h58m58s)

[because as you're scrolling through a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m01s)

[form it's really obnoxious you get over](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m03s)

[a control that captures Mouse wheel and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m06s)

[then stops your scroll and Cycles the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m09s)

[value so admittedly this first check is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m13s)

[keyboard Focus within so you your focus](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m16s)

[would already have to be in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m19s)

[there still feels still feels](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m21s)

[potentially awkward feels like something](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m24s)

[I want to I I don't want always on by](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m26s)

[default](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m31s)

[okay okay so a couple things there I am](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m33s)

[wondering on these command parameters if](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m35s)

[it might be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m37s)

[better un increase okay what was what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m44s)

[was I doing comment on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m48s)

[button I commenting about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m52s)

[commands we should create a new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m56s)

[dependency property for the command](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m57s)

[parameters this should to how button](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=00h59m59s)

[works so I okay so the idea is that like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m01s)

[button for example has an onclick](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m04s)

[command or let me rephrase button has a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m08s)

[command property that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m11s)

[is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m14s)

[triggered when um the button is clicked](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m16s)

[right this thing has an increase](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m21s)

[command that is uh triggered on increase](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m23s)

[which occurs in a number of places I am](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m28s)

[thinking I am thinking that this might](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m35s)

[need to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m38s)

[be similar I I'm just trying to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m43s)

[decide yeah because if somebody wants](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m49s)

[the value they can always do it yeah](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m51s)

[okay current Kevin now agrees with past](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m53s)

[Kevin's assess](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m55s)

[uh so let's see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m57s)

[so up execution uh what is it prop DP uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h00m58s)

[there boom uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m04s)

[object uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m07s)

[increase and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m10s)

[parameter boom okay so type of object](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m13s)

[not that type](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m18s)

[of meric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m21s)

[down default value of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m24s)

[null we can do name of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m27s)

[here some point I'm going to go through](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m31s)

[you can technically tweak these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m34s)

[um um templates but changing the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m38s)

[built-in ones is kind of a pain in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m41s)

[butt but I may I may look at doing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m45s)

[something like that because it's really](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m47s)

[annoying okay there's that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m50s)

[that this one was set to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m54s)

[default going to I don't know if that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h01m57s)

[any cleaner than just saying null uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m01s)

[okay and then on increase rather than](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m03s)

[doing here we are going to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m07s)

[with hash the value I don't think you do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m12s)

[do we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m17s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m19s)

[that so can X](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m23s)

[execute defaults to false if the command](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m30s)

[isn't set and then passes through okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m32s)

[same thing with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m37s)

[decrease go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m39s)

[here uh prop](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m41s)

[DP and to be and just to be clear this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m44s)

[thing didn't sit because it was bad code](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m47s)

[for a year it sat because I was working](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m51s)

[on the 5 release and I I didn't want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m53s)

[put this as part part of the 50 release](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m55s)

[so it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m56s)

[wasn't um wasn't necessarily anything](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h02m58s)

[bad about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m00s)

[this uh parameter boom bo boom uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m02s)

[numeric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m07s)

[Downer up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m08s)

[down all](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m10s)

[there rid of the question mark because](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m12s)

[reference types doesn't work that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m15s)

[way name ofm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m17s)

[okay so that goes like that that fres](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m27s)

[and body all the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m30s)

[things fres and body all the things okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m32s)

[great okay got that we got that we got](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m37s)

[that got a value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m40s)

[changed](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m45s)

[value this do raise when](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m51s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h03m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m04s)

[interesting I kind of expected](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m06s)

[this where are you where are you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m10s)

[used oh you're inside of the property](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m18s)

[Hey JC welcome welcome welcome we are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m21s)

[taking taking a look at doing the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m25s)

[numeric up down control and getting that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m27s)

[merged into the material design repo](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m30s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m32s)

[been a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m33s)

[while like a lot a little while okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m35s)

[this gives me pause](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m39s)

[here Xbox](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m43s)

[field this is okay this is a template](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m46s)

[part that's good](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m51s)

[got the default style](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m57s)

[metadata at our on apply template so for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h04m59s)

[custom controls like this it's important](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m02s)

[to remember that there's the separation](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m04s)

[between the behavior of the control and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m06s)

[the the look of the control right now in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m11s)

[the C we are focused on how this control](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m13s)

[behaves okay so if apply template gets](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m18s)

[invoked twice it properly unregisters](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m20s)

[some stuff it pulls out the temp plate](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m23s)

[child grabs them is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m28s)

[this it's all used inside of here I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m32s)

[assume where else is textbox](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m36s)

[fied deriv](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m42s)

[from](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m45s)

[Roll just wondering if having this thing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m49s)

[derived from control is appropriate or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m51s)

[if this thing should derive from text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m53s)

[box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h05m55s)

[itself there's a lot of benefits to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m00s)

[having it drive from textbox](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m02s)

[itself most notably not needing a text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m04s)

[box but there are disadvantages as well](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m09s)

[as then you are getting everything from](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m13s)

[Xbox that bad](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m18s)

[though really what we want is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m22s)

[something that just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m28s)

[prevents the value from](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m30s)

[changing like let's let's fire this guy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m33s)

[up again and look I what stops me from](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m35s)

[typing the letter a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m39s)

[in I don't know if there's much that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m46s)

[stops me](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m49s)

[that uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m51s)

[I do this and I type](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h06m59s)

[A Nothing Stops](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m02s)

[me that concerns me a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m06s)

[bit that concerns me a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m10s)

[bit I mean obviously it it auto corrects](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m14s)

[as soon as you tweak](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m17s)

[it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m19s)

[but feels like on committed that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m21s)

[shouldn't do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m24s)

[that so the the advantage of deriving](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m27s)

[from control is then you don't have to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m30s)

[worry about somebody like data binding](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m31s)

[to your text property for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m33s)

[example and they're now forced to bind](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m35s)

[through the the value property probably](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m38s)

[better probably](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m42s)

[better but given that that text box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m47s)

[exists](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m51s)

[oh so on on Focus lost](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m56s)

[it'll](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h07m59s)

[it'll](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m03s)

[what oh is the else case just not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m06s)

[needing to be Implement that is that the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m09s)

[deal I go here and tab](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m11s)

[away right this is going to not parse as](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m14s)

[an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m18s)

[end whenever Visual Studio catches up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m20s)

[come](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m23s)

[on yeah](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m24s)

[so this feels](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m30s)

[like yeah a pace validator I'm actually](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m35s)

[okay with letting the user type random](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m39s)

[garbage in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m41s)

[here I think I'm actually okay with that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m44s)

[as long as as if this actually works](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m47s)

[properly so because if this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m50s)

[doesn't if this doesn't work work what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m53s)

[we actually want to do because where is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m56s)

[the I think value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h08m58s)

[property yeah I I think what we actually](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m04s)

[want to do is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m07s)

[this like we actually want to come in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m10s)

[here we want to do something like else](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m13s)

[if well okay so let's start let's start](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m17s)

[with a few things one we're doing a lot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m20s)

[of work here uh if uh textbox](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m22s)

[is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m26s)

[Xbox let's let's just let's eliminate](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m28s)

[the null case it's not likely to occur](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m31s)

[shouldn't show up we're going to get rid](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m34s)

[of that okay so do this no no longer](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m36s)

[great okay so inside of here because I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m42s)

[mean we lost focus on what this guy has](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m46s)

[to be non for us to lose focus on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m48s)

[it um this is not a need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m52s)

[bang this is not a needed bang this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m55s)

[not I think this might have been an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h09m58s)

[artifact of the old compiler that was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m01s)

[stupid and couldn't keep track of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m03s)

[stuff maybe not feels like it might have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m06s)

[just been a mistake okay so if this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m09s)

[didn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m11s)

[work actually yes co-pilot that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m12s)

[exactly what I want to thank](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m14s)

[you freaking show off of an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m16s)

[AI remember co-pilot I'm still the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m21s)

[developer darn it and I will insult you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m24s)

[if I want](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m26s)

[to just because you got the answer right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m28s)

[doesn't mean that you're always going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m30s)

[to okay this way because I think that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m32s)

[gives a better experience if we have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m36s)

[a we have something like this where you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m39s)

[type in you know that garbage just to be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m41s)

[clear I'm going to get rid of that tab](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m45s)

[okay puts it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m47s)

[back better better better better um I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m48s)

[think I like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m53s)

[I think I like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m56s)

[doing a UI more akin to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h10m58s)

[this because if we're here right up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m05s)

[down arrow keys and then Mouse wheel is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m09s)

[also](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m12s)

[working](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m14s)

[um we need to add a property to turn the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m16s)

[mouse wheel](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m20s)

[off um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m22s)

[maybe we should do the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m25s)

[keyboard](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m35s)

[change so I I think we're g to have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m37s)

[something that'll that we allow typing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m41s)

[and something where we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m43s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m45s)

[um I think that would](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m47s)

[be much better here let's do prop DP Now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m50s)

[problem is is what do we call this thing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m57s)

[so it's clearly a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h11m59s)

[Bo um and then what do we call the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m01s)

[setting for allowing Mouse](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m04s)

[wheel](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m07s)

[um allow change](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m09s)

[on Mouse](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m12s)

[wheel that clear](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m15s)

[enough is uh trying to think of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m22s)

[that I don't know if this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m27s)

[clear right is that clear enough allow](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m29s)

[change on Mouse wheel allow value change](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m32s)

[on Mouse wheel now we're just getting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m35s)

[long um accept Mouse](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m37s)

[wheel okay if anyone has bright ideas](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m48s)

[I'm all ears because I I don't know what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m50s)

[to name this thing uh let's see and then](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m53s)

[I think we'll default it to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m56s)

[True is it bad because it only triggers](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h12m58s)

[allow change on scroll that is much](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m03s)

[better I I like that thank](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m05s)

[you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m09s)

[um there um the question now becomes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m18s)

[what's the appropriate Default true or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m26s)

[false it feels like opt-in Behavior to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m30s)

[me I'm I'm tempted to default it to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m33s)

[false tempted to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m38s)

[that I I think](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m46s)

[that I don't think it's Behavior I would](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m50s)

[expect to occur by default](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m53s)

[right it's it's I don't like it on WPF](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m56s)

[forms when like text boxes steal my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h13m59s)

[mouse wheel and do that crap again it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m01s)

[requires Focus so it's not as big of a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m03s)

[deal we'll just do something like this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m13s)

[and we'll do that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m18s)

[that'll I'm not sure how I feel about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m22s)

[this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m24s)

[hey co-pilot what's the one next](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m28s)

[one come on you wrote the first one you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m31s)

[couldn't write the end region for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m33s)

[me okay um want to think about what we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m37s)

[may want as any I'm trying to decide](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m41s)

[if having these enabled by default and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m44s)

[not having a way to turn them off](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m47s)

[doesn't feel that bad to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m48s)

[me see we'll see there I I suspect](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m51s)

[there's additional customizations people](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m53s)

[are going to want here but let's let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m55s)

[look at the UI side of the the fence for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m57s)

[the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h14m59s)

[moment uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m00s)

[themes and then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m04s)

[numeric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m06s)

[down there okay now we've switched gears](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m11s)

[we are no longer in the behavior side of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m15s)

[the control this is going to be how the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m17s)

[control is going to and you'll note this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m19s)

[is a dependent style here here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m22s)

[um going to clear off some of these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m28s)

[comments I don't think that's overly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m31s)

[helpful the other thing that I would](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m33s)

[like to do is I would like to give this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m35s)

[a different](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m37s)

[name um the idea here is going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m38s)

[be go look at what called these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m43s)

[guys uh let's textbox base I want the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m47s)

[top level](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m50s)

[controls probably at the bottom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m52s)

[okay um material design numeric up down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h15m57s)

[so I we want to give all of these guys](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m01s)

[Keys uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m06s)

[design up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m11s)

[down uh with the data grid the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m14s)

[autogenerated columns look better than](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m16s)

[the custom columns](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m18s)

[in autogenerated columns look better](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m22s)

[than the the custom columns in edit mode](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m24s)

[is this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m27s)

[intended](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m30s)

[well yes and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m32s)

[no and I'll clarify what I mean by that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m35s)

[so there are a handful of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m39s)

[cases so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m43s)

[the is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m45s)

[there are a handful](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h16m55s)

[of your authorization was I didn't know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m03s)

[I was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m06s)

[authorizing Studio I wanted to open a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m07s)

[file okay Visual Studio why is the oh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m11s)

[because I'm in external sources okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m14s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m17s)

[exciting not where I was trying to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m19s)

[okay so there is a data grid assistant](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m21s)

[class](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m26s)

[um and so specifically when we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m31s)

[talking about what's being set up on the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m33s)

[the data grid The](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m38s)

[autogenerated](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m41s)

[Columns um because these guys here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m43s)

[uh you'll note this style isn't it's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m52s)

[defaulted here but I think the default](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m56s)

[style is um so it's it does this apply](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h17m57s)

[material design style for column and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m01s)

[you'll note depending on the type of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m03s)

[column it is it goes through and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m05s)

[intentionally pulls out some of these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m08s)

[Styles right so if we just pick on say](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m11s)

[the text one right if we go here I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m13s)

[believe this the default style for this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m16s)

[guy so the the material design data grid](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m24s)

[this style here is the default style for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m25s)

[your data](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m28s)

[grid there are some attached properties](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m29s)

[that are set on that style for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m32s)

[autogenerated things like text style](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m34s)

[right which means that your um your your](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m38s)

[data grid text columns are automatically](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m44s)

[picking up this style here now there's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m47s)

[nothing stopping you from taking these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m51s)

[styles here and just directly applying](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m54s)

[them to your your Styles as well right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h18m57s)

[because all all these all this assist](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m02s)

[class ends up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m05s)

[doing is when columns are automatically](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m06s)

[generated it just goes through and says](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m11s)

[okay where's the text column for the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m14s)

[text column I'm going to set the element](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m16s)

[style and the element editing style of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m20s)

[that column](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m23s)

[so if you have your own data grid text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m25s)

[column you could apply this same](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m28s)

[template right autogenerating editing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m32s)

[Tex stle so that one there and the text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m35s)

[stle and again pick out the pick out the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m38s)

[relevant two for whichever column types](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m41s)

[you're talking about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m43s)

[JC but if what you end up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m44s)

[doing where's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m48s)

[my where my solution oh filter that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m52s)

[why um but for example in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m55s)

[the datag](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h19m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m05s)

[GD where is a good](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m06s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m09s)

[example uh yeah so for example this guy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m11s)

[here in the demo](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m15s)

[app the the editing element style and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m18s)

[the element style are then being](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m22s)

[appropriately set you'll note these ones](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m24s)

[are slightly different than what's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m26s)

[coming from the attached class so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m28s)

[depending on what you want them to look](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m30s)

[like and behave with you may need to set](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m31s)

[these two properties on your one let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m35s)

[see you call out the description yeah so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m37s)

[description because this is a just a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m40s)

[regular text column nothing is setting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m44s)

[these two](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m46s)

[properties this guy I don't doubt looks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m47s)

[somewhat worse um and that's just an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m50s)

[artifact of the fact that we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m54s)

[can't we can't do anything](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h20m57s)

[about these columns there's there's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m00s)

[a way to implicitly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m03s)

[apply styles to these things so if I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m05s)

[wanted to fix description right to make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m08s)

[it look like the autogenerated one what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m10s)

[I would end up doing is I would end up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m12s)

[going with like uh editing element style](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m14s)

[static resource and then I'd go over](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m18s)

[here let's see uh editing Tex stle so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m20s)

[I'd probably grab gra this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m24s)

[one we come back here and go plop there](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m26s)

[and then I'd go uh element style static](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m29s)

[resource and then I would grab let's see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m33s)

[Tex stle](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m37s)

[here I'd plop that in and now if we now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m38s)

[if we take a look at it it should in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m41s)

[theory look as good as the autogenerated](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m44s)

[ones or at least look the same](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m46s)

[right that autogenerating Fe feature is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m52s)

[actually it's both a blessing and a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m55s)

[curse see now we get now we get this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h21m58s)

[Behavior rather than the the white box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m01s)

[like what we were getting before so the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m03s)

[other way you can work around it is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m06s)

[you'll note there's a material design](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m10s)

[data grid text column which is different](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m12s)

[than the data grid text column](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m14s)

[right and the the advantage here is we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m17s)

[can then apply extra stuff because it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m20s)

[now one of our types](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m23s)

[but because the the data grid column](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m25s)

[here right this guy um this guy doesn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m28s)

[have a style](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m32s)

[property so there's no there's no way](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m33s)

[for us to apply an implicit style to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m35s)

[this element like we would some other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m39s)

[zaml element in WPF it's just because](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m40s)

[it's not a real thing so yeah something](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m43s)

[like this fixes it before what used to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m47s)

[happen is the um the bug reports that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m51s)

[would come in is people would always](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m54s)

[yell and complain and go my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m56s)

[autogenerated columns don't look as good](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m57s)

[as the other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h22m59s)

[ones and then it might have been Nicolai](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m00s)

[I don't remember uh somebody put in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m03s)

[autogenerating column feature which was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m05s)

[great right now the autogenerating ones](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m07s)

[all look nice but then what ends up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m09s)

[happening is now now we get the bug](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m12s)

[reports like what you said JC where it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m15s)

[like wait a minute now now the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m17s)

[autogenerated ones look great and the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m19s)

[other ones look bad it's like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m21s)

[well yes but that's only because data](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m22s)

[grids are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m25s)

[hard so yes long answer for the question](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m27s)

[give or take a little bit](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m39s)

[uh all I'm getting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m41s)

[pinged okay okay cool I will I will](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m53s)

[reply to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m56s)

[that okay up down up down there we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h23m59s)

[go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m04s)

[and real quick is he](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m19s)

[uh sorry my little pack partner came](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m20s)

[online](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m23s)

[he is in a very different time zone than](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m25s)

[me so we only we only communicate it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m27s)

[kind of like uh most of you folks that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m30s)

[are over in the the Europe side of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m32s)

[pond whereas it's late for me it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m36s)

[bloody early for you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m39s)

[um about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m47s)

[okay so izy I just floated the idea of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h24m59s)

[the firewall settings over what happens](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m02s)

[okay um I think what we're going to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m06s)

[here because this is a very like this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m08s)

[a stupid simple template this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m11s)

[actually a great control to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m12s)

[demonstrate the the Simplicity of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m14s)

[doing um a custom control in WPF right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m18s)

[the basic elements are you have a style](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m21s)

[the style sets the template property the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m24s)

[template uh has a control template and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m28s)

[that defines the layout see JC good luck](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m31s)

[um in this case there's just a border](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m35s)

[border allows some of these properties](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m38s)

[and this is one of the interesting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m41s)

[things that happens a lot is people](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m42s)

[forget that sometimes what happens is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m43s)

[there is not a easy way to set all of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m47s)

[the properties so for example this this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m51s)

[template is only using 1 2 3](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m53s)

[4 uh five six total controls that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h25m57s)

[it um which is which is fine but it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m03s)

[it's not not quite what we want to end](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m07s)

[up doing um there's also a weird thing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m10s)

[going on here with this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m13s)

[command binding something's up here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m14s)

[we'll look at that in a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m17s)

[minute um but you can imagine if you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m18s)

[were to set a property I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m22s)

[think of one um my mind is a blank at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m24s)

[the moment but for example if we were to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m28s)

[delete this this padding assignment now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m30s)

[is meaningless right so often with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m34s)

[custom controls the bug reports that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m36s)

[come in are hey I set property X it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m38s)

[didn't do what I expected right it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m42s)

[either just didn't work because that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m44s)

[property wasn't being consumed by the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m47s)

[control template somewhere or it was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m48s)

[being consumed in a way that didn't make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m50s)

[sense or occasionally there's a value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m52s)

[converter or something on it and it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m55s)

[like well I typed in four but I got](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m56s)

[something a lot bigger than four h yeah](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h26m58s)

[that happens sometimes um like for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m01s)

[example that the floating hint stuff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m03s)

[that we were looking at earlier right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m05s)

[there's math that's being applied you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m07s)

[type in a value you get](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m08s)

[something](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m13s)

[uh and you get something very different](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m15s)

[uh okay so the other thing that's a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m30s)

[little more interesting down here is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m34s)

[stuff like this is this is kind of an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m36s)

[unusual way to end up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m39s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m42s)

[um doing commands because the most](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m45s)

[people when they learn commanding in WPF](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m48s)

[they learned it from the perspective of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m51s)

[building an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m53s)

[app and so they the command is a it's a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m55s)

[thingy that implements I command and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h27m59s)

[it's something that I put in my view](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m01s)

[model right and that's that's the way it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m02s)

[works which that is mostly true right um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m04s)

[let's go pick](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m09s)

[on buttons probably one of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m10s)

[simplest right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m16s)

[um you'll note in here I hunt for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m17s)

[Command right command B doesn't show up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m22s)

[anywhere inside my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m25s)

[button at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m26s)

[all right and the the idea here is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m28s)

[the command of a button is the thing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m33s)

[that the control is going to fire](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m36s)

[when um when the user interacts with the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m40s)

[right so the code behind of the button](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m44s)

[grabs that the command that was set on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m47s)

[that property and then fires it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m49s)

[appropriately now we've already done](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m51s)

[that right we've got our increase](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m53s)

[decrease right that end up getting I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m55s)

[shouldn't say fire executed is the the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h28m57s)

[better word right so it will attempt to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m00s)

[to execute the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m03s)

[control and away we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m04s)

[go now the it's also interesting here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m07s)

[I'm I'm kind of wondering if the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m11s)

[increased commands can](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m13s)

[execute returns false should we not be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m15s)

[bumping the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m19s)

[value like this is this is one of those](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m20s)

[weird things where I'm not entirely](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m22s)

[clear of what the expect to beh there's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m24s)

[a weird interaction here but short](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m26s)

[version we shouldn't be binding these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m28s)

[here right these should not be coming](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m30s)

[through because what's going to end up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m33s)

[happening because these things are named](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m35s)

[part increase button part decrease](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m37s)

[button the code behind on its apply](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m39s)

[template is going to pull these things](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m41s)

[out based upon that name right so we can](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m45s)

[see part increase button right same for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m48s)

[decrease so it goes into the template](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m51s)

[finds The Thing by name pulls it out and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m53s)

[then it's going to interact with it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m56s)

[specifically in this case it's going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m57s)

[interact with the click event right so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h29m59s)

[you'll note this feel for people who are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m02s)

[used to mvvm this is this is like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m04s)

[terrifying mode it's like ah you're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m06s)

[using Code behind and you're registering](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m08s)

[for events bad bad bad it's like well](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m10s)

[okay but remember we're building the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m12s)

[library for this not not an app the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m14s)

[whole the whole point of mvvm that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m17s)

[people often seem to forget is you have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m19s)

[that clear separation of concerns a big](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m21s)

[part of that is to uh enable easy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m24s)

[testing right because you don't want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m27s)

[have to stand up an entire WPF app to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m29s)

[test some little bit of interaction](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m32s)

[wasteful right you want to have that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m34s)

[clear separation between what what is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m35s)

[what logic goes in my view and what part](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m38s)

[goes in my view model so I think here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m40s)

[what we're going to end up doing is to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m43s)

[bring the two buttons to the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m46s)

[right special we do right so this is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m52s)

[dock panel I'm kind of wondering if it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h30m57s)

[would be better to do a grid then a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h31m00s)

[grid column](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h31m03s)

[definition right and then we'll do grid](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h31m06s)

[column definition column definition with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h31m09s)

[uh well it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h31m13s)

[just do that right bu boom and then with](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h31m15s)

[Studio yeah what I heard is die Visual](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m28s)

[Studio die this is this is this is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m31s)

[perks of running the preview uh Visual](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m34s)

[Studio builds occasionally that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m37s)

[happens it doesn't happen](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m41s)

[often but it does](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m43s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m47s)

[okay let's try this again Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m51s)

[please compile and run a simple WPF](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m54s)

[application it's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h36m57s)

[hard this should not be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m01s)

[hard then I think the only thing that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m07s)

[this control is going to be lacking is a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m10s)

[couple UI tests and better samples in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m12s)

[the demo um okay so clearly that doesn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m16s)

[work oh and the reason it doesn't work](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m21s)

[because I'm a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m25s)

[[ __ ] um we went through and changed](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m26s)

[this style by adding an X key onto here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m30s)

[called material design numeric up down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m33s)

[the problem is is when we look at the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m35s)

[numeric up down code behind the default](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m37s)

[style key that it is looking for is not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m40s)

[Material design numeric up down it is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m44s)

[looking for a style key that is keyed on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m48s)

[the type of the class normal that is uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m51s)

[simple L I know Izzy I know I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m56s)

[know uh the but the because it is key](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h37m59s)

[looking for a style whose x key is the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m05s)

[type um it ends up not finding anything](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m08s)

[so what we want to do is something very](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m12s)

[similar to what uh we can look at like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m14s)

[our](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m16s)

[chip uh oh this is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m19s)

[is setting up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m23s)

[a uh what do we do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m26s)

[for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m31s)

[wees I did I hate](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m33s)

[this oh oh that is so disgusting okay so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m37s)

[here's what I don't like is these so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m40s)

[these are referred to as as implicit](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m44s)

[Styles meaning they don't have an X key](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m46s)

[defined so it is implicitly inferred](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m48s)

[from the target type and so the key it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m51s)

[becomes equal to the Target](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m54s)

[type great that's an implicit style the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h38m56s)

[the the problem being is most people to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m01s)

[to derive from this becomes now a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m04s)

[bit of a challenge because Styles have a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m06s)

[based on property you can tell them hey](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m08s)

[this style is based on insert other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m10s)

[style here right and you typically do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m13s)

[static resource blah blah blah and the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m15s)

[issue with having the the default be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m17s)

[implicit is it requires the consumer to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m20s)

[know that they have to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m22s)

[xtype you know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m24s)

[WPF dialogue host in this case right in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m26s)

[order to be able to have and this is now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m30s)

[circular dependency because this is now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m32s)

[based on itself but it requires somebody](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m33s)

[to be able to know how to do this I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m36s)

[not sure I like that so I think what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m38s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m40s)

[instead because that's that's kind of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m42s)

[yucky we're going to go down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m45s)

[here style target type uh let's see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m49s)

[vpf uh come](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m56s)

[on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h39m59s)

[oh mer up down oh I'm debugging that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m00s)

[why it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m04s)

[being](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m06s)

[sorry there you go give me intellisense](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m08s)

[thank you based on static resource zial](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m11s)

[design numeric up down and I'm just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m15s)

[going to self-close this tag right so I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m17s)

[now have an implicit style who's BAS](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m19s)

[class is the the name style but it means](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m23s)

[that now if somebody wants to you know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m27s)

[do their own template they have a common](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m29s)

[style that they can start from right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m32s)

[they aren't required to go all the way](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m34s)

[off of it the other thing that this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m36s)

[helps with is if you build something](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m38s)

[like a Maui application not all zaml](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m40s)

[Frameworks](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m43s)

[support um having a based on with an X](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m44s)

[type as a key they want a string in at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m49s)

[you Maui and so this pattern here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m52s)

[translates better to other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m56s)

[Frameworks for what it's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h40m58s)

[worth hey look at that now we go up now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m01s)

[we go down yay we have a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m04s)

[style](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m09s)

[okay now there's a couple things that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m10s)

[are a little](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m13s)

[weird but overall I think I like this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m15s)

[much](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m18s)

[better I like this much better okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m19s)

[that's going to get us that's going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m22s)

[get us much further along than I thought](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m24s)

[I I at some point I think what we need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m27s)

[is we need the outline and the fill um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m30s)

[look same as what the other text box has](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m33s)

[but those can come a little bit later](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m37s)

[let's jump to the UI test real quick WPF](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m40s)

[and then I don't think we have one](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m44s)

[created](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m45s)

[yet let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m46s)

[add meric up down because I would like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m50s)

[tests love my tests must have tests uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m54s)

[let's see new](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h41m58s)

[class Eric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m01s)

[down yes this is going to be a fairly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m04s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m07s)

[one because we just really have a a text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m08s)

[box at two uh is there a minute Max](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m11s)

[property there are there are and that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m13s)

[actually part of rather than working on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m15s)

[the the demo side of those things I was](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m17s)

[going to do it with test to make them](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m19s)

[make them work cuz that's the other](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m21s)

[think that's kind of bothering me is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m23s)

[the uh where are they I think they are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m26s)

[in the call back of the value property](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m28s)

[so there's your min max there um and I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m31s)

[think they just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m34s)

[default uh to int max value and int Min](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m36s)

[value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m39s)

[yeah it's there](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m41s)

[the they don't look like they're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m45s)

[actually respected anywhere though so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m47s)

[that's that's exciting oh there they are](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m49s)

[they are respected the coer call back so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m53s)

[on the value property the coer numeric](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m56s)

[up down pulls in the value Implement](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h42m59s)

[Implement and Away you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m03s)

[go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m06s)

[uh yeah and that's the thing is the the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m08s)

[extensions library is good but it it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m11s)

[does implement several controls in a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m14s)

[very mvvm style rather than in a custom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m17s)

[control style which I'm not a huge fan](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m19s)

[of so it definitely works and it fills a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m22s)

[need and I don't think all of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m25s)

[controls that are in it would ever make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m27s)

[it into the main library but we can for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m29s)

[some of these we can start to clean them](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m33s)

[up a little bit okay so for the test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m34s)

[we're going to do test base right and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m37s)

[then oh were you going to do it all for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m40s)

[me thank you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m41s)

[co-pilot oh come on you were doing so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m43s)

[well you were doing so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m46s)

[well okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m48s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m51s)

[uh on Mouse over background is set no](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m54s)

[co-pilot uh let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h43m58s)

[see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m00s)

[numeric](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m02s)

[buttons uh increase and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m04s)

[decrease value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m07s)

[okay so we need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m10s)

[to why are you not finding the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m12s)

[type work up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m19s)

[down oh isn't that the class I am I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m21s)

[crazy I am not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m30s)

[crazy what am I just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m37s)

[stupid load](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m40s)

[zaml last](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m42s)

[name](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m46s)

[yes load zaml](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m48s)

[oh dang](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m53s)

[it so I this is you'll note all of these](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m55s)

[ones here the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h44m58s)

[um the names of the name spaces is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m01s)

[plural this is intentional because if](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m04s)

[you don't you get a naming conflict this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m07s)

[here is matching the name space not the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m10s)

[class name which is why it's not working](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m12s)

[dang](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m13s)

[nabbit numeric up downs just sounds](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m14s)

[weird whatever hey look at that boom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m18s)

[yeah thany Izzy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m22s)

[um I've had enough caffeine I I almost](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m24s)

[feel like I know how to code uh oh look](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m27s)

[at that it did did the needed okay so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m31s)

[we're going to start the value at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m35s)

[one we're going to do this guy here and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m36s)

[I believe we just do material design](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m40s)

[weird okay whatever okay and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m53s)

[then dropped a quote somewhere along the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h45m55s)

[lines oh that's why it looks weird I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m02s)

[like man something seems wrong about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m04s)

[this okay great numeric up down uh VAR](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m06s)

[plus button gets uh let's see wait Mar](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m12s)

[up down oh man it is on point it is on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m17s)

[point it doesn't know that the slashes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m20s)

[for types you know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m22s)

[what you're you're doing you're doing](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m25s)

[good](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m27s)

[co-pilot H don't really need that we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m29s)

[going to we're going to just look at the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m31s)

[value maybe we should look at the text](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m33s)

[as](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m35s)

[well we can do that pull the text box](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m36s)

[out okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m38s)

[now okay that's fine but that's not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m41s)

[really what we're going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m44s)

[for okay so uh plus button click that's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m45s)

[correct co-pilot then we expect that now](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m49s)

[my minus twice there minus one more time](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m52s)

[I mean I guess that works](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h46m56s)

[um you were doing so well co-pilot you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m04s)

[were doing so so well I I almost believe](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m06s)

[in you okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m09s)

[uh this is pulling the text but I also](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m13s)

[want to do assert equal I want to Value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m17s)

[ensure that I get the right one so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m21s)

[you'll note that this guy here get value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m23s)

[isn't a method that actually exists on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m27s)

[my numeric up down the reason is because](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m29s)

[these these guys here are all](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m33s)

[implemented as um extension methods](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m35s)

[there's a cool trick I've](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m37s)

[got we call it Kevin remembers where he](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m39s)

[put his](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m43s)

[attributes there we are so if I do this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m44s)

[and I come over here and I do numeric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m48s)

[down I order it LM](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m52s)

[o right and then I come back over to my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h47m55s)

[test get value now magically](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m00s)

[exists so what what is happening is zaml](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m04s)

[test has a source generator behind the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m07s)

[scenes that rips through all of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m08s)

[controls that are defined here and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m11s)

[generates up extension methods for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m14s)

[accessing all of their dependency](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m16s)

[properties it's also secretly doing that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m18s)

[inside of itself for all the built-in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m20s)

[WPF types and it Jens extension methods](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m23s)

[for almost all the properties there's a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m27s)

[handful of them that are on an exclusion](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m29s)

[list because either the property type is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m31s)

[something that can't be reasonably](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m33s)

[serialized or similar so there's there's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m34s)

[a handful of those so we can do this do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m37s)

[this just like that we almost had to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m40s)

[think we wrote a UI](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m42s)

[test okay Visual Studio run my UI test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m47s)

[pretty please](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m50s)

[I'm very happy that it even knew to put](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m54s)

[the test recorder at the top Co pilot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m55s)

[you so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m58s)

[awesome you're so awesome my](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h48m59s)

[app it failed why did you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m03s)

[fail okay what did you fail](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m06s)

[on uh name cannot begin with the one](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m10s)

[character that sounds like a syntax](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m15s)

[failure what I do wrong](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m19s)

[oh I am inside of a multi-line string](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m25s)

[literal or a hear string or a he do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m30s)

[string or whatever the name is that I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m34s)

[can't remember right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m36s)

[now okay now we've got go here boom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m37s)

[flaps you okay uh let's see material](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m42s)

[design flat button could not find](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m46s)

[resource this is useful all right so if](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m48s)

[somebody were to bring this in](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m51s)

[um our style is not being brought in the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m53s)

[issue here is it works in the demo app](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m56s)

[because the demo app basically Imports](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h49m59s)

[everything but this guy here is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m01s)

[referencing a resource](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m04s)

[dictionary um that he is not directly](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m05s)

[including so we just need to import it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m09s)

[uh merge](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m13s)

[dictionaries St dictionary source and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m15s)

[then](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m18s)

[design design I can't my own bloody](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m27s)

[name uh I just author the library it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m33s)

[doesn't mean I know anything about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m36s)

[it we need the button one yeah you give](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m39s)

[me](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m44s)

[you okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m53s)

[oh I am already in a resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m54s)

[I do not need a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m57s)

[resource okay uh back to test roll that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h50m59s)

[up so my big head's not in the way run](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m03s)

[test rosting literal thank you Izzy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m06s)

[seebe I should finish my Mountain Dew it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m10s)

[might help the brain work](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m13s)

[again okay so that was useful we click](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m19s)

[the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m23s)

[button and then it did not immediately](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m24s)

[change so the question is was it a speed](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m28s)

[problem um I guess let's start with this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m34s)

[which line](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m38s)

[failed 29 and 30 so it's the minus](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m39s)

[button down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m42s)

[here that ended up being](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m45s)

[problematic so let's do a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m51s)

[wait wait](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m55s)

[four I I I suspect this is timing and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h51m57s)

[that because the damel test doesn't know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m00s)

[anything about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m04s)

[the like timing of elements so it will](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m06s)

[just rip through things uh and I'm on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m09s)

[cofy 3](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m13s)

[already somehow it does make me feel a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m14s)

[little better is he I don't know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m17s)

[why uh uh no my uh oh thank you co-pilot](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m21s)

[yes that's exactly what I was about to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m25s)

[do and then the other one we don't need](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m27s)

[to wait on try](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m29s)

[this if this doesn't work we'll set a](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m32s)

[break point and actually stop the app so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m34s)

[we can test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m36s)

[it there there it works okay so it just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m38s)

[it was just a it was just a little too](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m41s)

[fast little too fast on the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m43s)

[check okay so numeric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m46s)

[down okay so now now we're going to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m49s)

[now we're going to do the max Min stuff](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m52s)

[and make sure all of these things apply](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m54s)

[because I I think there is a uh numeric](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m55s)

[EP down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h52m59s)

[with uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m01s)

[maximum](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m07s)

[vents okay so what I would like to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m10s)

[here is basically the same but I want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m13s)

[do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m16s)

[maximum equal to two and I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m19s)

[yeah we could keep all of this here okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m24s)

[so we don't need to test the initial](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m26s)

[value we want to click the button wait](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m28s)

[for it to go to two then we want to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m34s)

[again right um and we want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m35s)

[assert well actually I don't know if we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m41s)

[want to click it again and assert that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m43s)

[it doesn't change I think what I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m45s)

[actually want to do is down here I think](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m46s)

[I want to make I I the the button should](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m51s)

[disable when you hit the cap I believe](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m53s)

[CU when you are at your maximum you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m57s)

[shouldn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h53m59s)

[have](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m00s)

[um you shouldn't have the enabled button](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m03s)

[there so hey co-pilot check the pl that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m06s)

[the plus button is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m08s)

[disabled worthless uh okay assert false](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m11s)

[await uh plus](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m17s)

[button get is enabled right boom](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m19s)

[so it should be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m23s)

[disabled and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m26s)

[then then it should be](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m29s)

[re-enabled uh let's do this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m35s)

[disables uh plus button right and I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m36s)

[I'm fairly confident this thing's going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m41s)

[to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m42s)

[fail and like we could we could make](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m45s)

[sure that clicking doesn't do anything](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m47s)

[okay so conveniently did fail I I](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m56s)

[hopefully it failed right where we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h54m59s)

[expect we can see all of our output uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m01s)

[let's see expected false but was true](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m04s)

[right so right here so it is not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m07s)

[appropriately disabling not shocking](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m10s)

[that's kind of what we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m12s)

[expected um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m15s)

[the try to decide where I want to where](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m20s)

[I want to actually handle this at I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m22s)

[tempted to handle it in the code behind](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m24s)

[here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m28s)

[of ensuring that this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m31s)

[things can execute works](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m35s)

[properly I mean the we we should](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m40s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m42s)

[also Ju Just for kicks and Giggles let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m45s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m48s)

[just uh a plus button](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m49s)

[Buton left click right so we're going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m52s)

[do this if we were if we were to go past](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m55s)

[this right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h55m57s)

[um what what is my Base Class am I set](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m05s)

[to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m07s)

[attach uh attach debugger to remote](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m08s)

[process I would like to turn that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m11s)

[off okay um because I want to I want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m15s)

[just verif](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m20s)

[that when we when we bypass that](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m22s)

[plus and click the because we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m25s)

[clicking the plus button twice we should](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m27s)

[see it still cap it too now obviously](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m30s)

[once we disable the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m32s)

[button yeah there we go so it it ends up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m34s)

[stopping there right perfect that's what](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m37s)

[we expect and if it's not obvious we're](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m40s)

[at our break point this is the wonderful](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m43s)

[part about this UI test library is I can](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m46s)

[know do this and have it not hang or we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m48s)

[can flip that Boolean back and attach to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m52s)

[the process and debug inside of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m55s)

[it uh you know](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h56m58s)

[what do I care uh we can primary](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m03s)

[Constructors there's no reason not to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m09s)

[use okay](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m12s)

[so the appropriate place to disable the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m14s)

[button we could do it in the sty but](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m19s)

[that means that every style needs to go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m22s)

[through and deal with it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m24s)

[versus um curious where](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m29s)

[button look real quick I don't remember](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m34s)

[where button does we kind of want to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m37s)

[follow that same](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h57m38s)

[change trying to decide what the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m16s)

[appropriate way of handling is um I'm](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m19s)

[tempted to just do it inside of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m23s)

[here of uh setting](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m27s)

[the the enabled state of the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m32s)

[button we have access the buttons here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m36s)

[right so we can technically get at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m39s)

[this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m44s)

[um yeah I think we go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m50s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m53s)

[if Arrow up down DOT value](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=01h59m58s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m02s)

[uh up down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m06s)

[maximum](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m09s)

[right just straight disable the button](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m18s)

[uh let's see so numeric up](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m22s)

[down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m41s)

[and Amer up down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h00m43s)

[button this is give me a mild amount of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m00s)

[pause because](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m02s)

[it's something about this is not feeling](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m04s)

[correct to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m07s)

[me I'm struggling to put my finger on](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m08s)

[it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m13s)

[um minimum and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m16s)

[button that okay that should give our](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m34s)

[test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m38s)

[a happy](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m40s)

[path and then this will get us running](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m43s)

[and then I think after this I'm going to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m47s)

[just push the the pr and then I'm going](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m49s)

[to think I'll open it up for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m53s)

[review see if anybody else wants to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m56s)

[throw in on a review for it but](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h01m58s)

[potentially look](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m00s)

[at](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m03s)

[merging the](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m06s)

[green no what are you unhappy about](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m09s)

[now uh get is a oh we didn't](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m13s)

[back see this is why you write tests](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m18s)

[this is why you write](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m21s)

[T](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m24s)

[um going to do this in a different](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m27s)

[order right and then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m32s)

[you](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m34s)

[up uh let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m36s)

[see up here we're just grab this so](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m40s)

[enabled will be not equal rather thanal](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m45s)

[disabling that way there's always an](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m50s)

[assignment it'll flip itself back right](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m52s)

[so we'll just let this bring you up this](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m55s)

[goes here this goes here this goes here](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h02m58s)

[this goes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m00s)

[here this this like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m01s)

[this boom okay and run test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m04s)

[again then I think we'll have a copy and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m11s)

[paste replica for](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m14s)

[the the minus test](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m16s)

[green happiness happiness is a green](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m22s)

[test okay and then we go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m25s)

[here uh we go](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m28s)

[here at some point there should probably](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m31s)

[be validation to make sure that like](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m33s)

[minimum is strictly less than maximum or](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m35s)

[something](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m39s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m43s)

[disable um and we aren't using the we](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m47s)

[are using](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m50s)

[okay uh so let's see let's do](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m52s)

[to](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m55s)

[minimum one value of](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h03m57s)

[two right and so we will](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m01s)

[do minus button left click wait for it](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m04s)

[to go to one in both](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m07s)

[cases um assert that the minus button is](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m09s)

[not](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m14s)

[enabled then we will](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m15s)

[do plus button left click that it goes](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m17s)

[up a one and then go back to the minus](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m22s)

[button being](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m25s)

[rein same test different direction just](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m27s)

[to make sure both are working](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m30s)

[properly hey green test okay let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m33s)

[commit and](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m36s)

[push uh let's](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m38s)

[see](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m40s)

[cleaning uh up the numeric up down](https://youtu.be/VvsByLIbQ_4?t=02h04m42s)
