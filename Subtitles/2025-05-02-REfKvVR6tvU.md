[welcome back everyone uh we are going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m07s)

[dive back in more coding stuff on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m10s)

[Velopax back end i have a bunch of API](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m12s)

[stuff um had a chat with my partner](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m15s)

[the not too distant future uh more](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m32s)

[importantly I will be there uh but if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m35s)

[you are unable to attend in person due](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m38s)

[to uh the slightly high cost of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m40s)

[attending uh you can sign up for the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m44s)

[virtual experience and get access to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m48s)

[nearly all of the content at least the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m50s)

[sessions uh for free online to be able](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m52s)

[to go through and watch that so uh at a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m54s)

[minimum I always tell people sign up if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m57s)

[nothing else just to get access to the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h00m59s)

[the sessions and the recording it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m01s)

[great content it is going to be amazing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m03s)

[for anyone who's going to be in person](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m05s)

[let's see i think I saw didn't they have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m07s)

[uh yeah here so if we go maps if anyone](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m10s)

[wants to find me this expert meetup area](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m13s)

[uh I'm gonna be somewhere in I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m17s)

[know about that area the vast majority](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m20s)

[of the time so yeah find me in that in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m22s)

[that zone so somewhere between theater B](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m26s)

[and the code for good in the expert](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m30s)

[meetup area i will be in that vicinity](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m32s)

[so would love to meet up with people and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m35s)

[I have pack stickers so if anyone wants](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m37s)

[a Velipac sticker I will be around i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m39s)

[have lots please come talk to me uh okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m43s)

[next thing uh hero devs this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m46s)

[something I've only kind of briefly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m48s)

[mentioned once or twice um they offer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m50s)

[what they call uh never- ending support](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m53s)

[NES i'm an old um Nintendo player so I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m55s)

[see NES and I get a very different](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h01m59s)

[picture in my head but that's okay uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m01s)

[but the idea here is they offer uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m04s)

[patching support specifically for like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m07s)

[CVS and security vulnerabilities for out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m09s)

[of support frameworks and they do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m12s)

[have.net but I believe at present it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m13s)

[just um net 6 now obviously in most](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m16s)

[cases the correct thing to do is update](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m21s)

[to a supported framework if you can but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m23s)

[practically in the real world you either](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m26s)

[don't have time or there's other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m27s)

[constraints that make this difficult um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m29s)

[so if you are at all interested in a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m32s)

[solution that doesn't involve needing to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m36s)

[be a migration they aim to come in um at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m37s)

[a much lower cost than having to do a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m40s)

[full migration and then you can keep](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m42s)

[running on your old stuff uh it's again](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m44s)

[worth noting that ideally if you can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m46s)

[upgrade that's probably best because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m49s)

[this is like uh stabilizing a dying](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m51s)

[product not like breathing new life into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m54s)

[it so if you if you can get yourself off](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m57s)

[of that that's better and at some point](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h02m59s)

[I need to update my little link because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m02s)

[I do have an affiliate link with them](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m04s)

[because I'm now an affiliate so yay uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m06s)

[but yeah so they are fairly cool guys](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m10s)

[and gals i guess I've chatted with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m13s)

[several of them now at this point and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m15s)

[met up with them and even got a cool](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m17s)

[little pocket watch which was kind of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m19s)

[slick uh with the the justification](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m21s)

[being that they give you more time all](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m24s)

[right like if you need to if you need](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m25s)

[more time before you can actually do a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m28s)

[proper migration uh that is what what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m29s)

[they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m33s)

[offer okay velopac now I think some](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m34s)

[people have heard me mention this name a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m38s)

[few times i'm one of the founders yada](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m39s)

[yada uh Velopac is we'll call it a nextg](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m41s)

[installer updater uh it is currently](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m45s)

[built with a lot of net stuff but it is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m49s)

[not net specific we have support uh for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m52s)

[say electron and I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m56s)

[all of the I really should just memorize](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h03m58s)

[this table right C# Russ JavaScript C++](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m00s)

[and then plans for u more other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m03s)

[languages and frameworks as things are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m06s)

[coming and in our sample apps we've got](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m08s)

[quite a few kind of demonstrating some](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m10s)

[different um use cases depending on what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m12s)

[you are interested in doing but today](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m15s)

[what we are looking at is fixing a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m18s)

[handful of things we are very close to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m20s)

[having our backend thing launch so just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m23s)

[to be clear the installer updator](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m25s)

[framework free open source you can hit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m27s)

[up to GitHub go try it out um I will say](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m29s)

[there's been a number of people who have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m32s)

[logged or have run into problems on the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m34s)

[current release which is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m36s)

[1053 um if you go to grab it grab the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m38s)

[preview nougat package there's just a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m42s)

[couple bugs that we've fixed um that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m43s)

[have bitten a few people like if you're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m47s)

[using uh Gitia or Jia I don't know how](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m48s)

[to say it um as like an upload source](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m52s)

[there's a bug in there where it doesn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m54s)

[reflect or it doesn't the the VPK tool](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m56s)

[doesn't respect the the merge flag so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h04m59s)

[there's just a there's just a handful of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m03s)

[kind of those edge cases that people](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m04s)

[bump into so if you have any problems](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m06s)

[grab the latest preview package a lot of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m09s)

[those things are fixed we're about to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m10s)

[roll another um full release package](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m12s)

[here shortly um we're just working on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m15s)

[getting that MSI support that we did](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m17s)

[previously merged in but once that goes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m19s)

[in you can expect that there's going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m21s)

[be another full release kind of rolling](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m23s)

[out the door very quickly thereafter](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m25s)

[possibly before the end of this stream](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m28s)

[um sorry I'm doing date math in my head](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m31s)

[to figure out when Kayn wakes up so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m34s)

[we'll see it It's going to be happening](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m36s)

[imminently um but yeah okay so there's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m39s)

[that now the part that we're working on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m41s)

[is not part of that we uh as part of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m44s)

[Velipac because like the the installer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m48s)

[and the updater are great but then the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m50s)

[next thing goes okay well where do you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m53s)

[host that stuff right how do you do how](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m54s)

[do you deal with all of the things that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h05m58s)

[go along with that because the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m00s)

[tooling will will push it up to say](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m01s)

[GitHub releases if that's where you want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m03s)

[to host it or similar um I think we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m05s)

[support I don't know four or five](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m07s)

[different kind of um places that people](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m09s)

[will commonly push to like an S3 bucket](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m12s)

[or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m14s)

[similar but if you want a fully hosted](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m14s)

[solution something managed where you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m17s)

[don't have to think that is what we are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m19s)

[working on that is what is forthcoming](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m20s)

[so that is where we get flow yay flow](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m22s)

[flow is happy um but this is also where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m26s)

[we have our our paid tier stuff right so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m30s)

[if you want to host it yourself you want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m34s)

[to roll with at have at it right more](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m35s)

[the marrier um if you want somebody else](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m38s)

[to manage it throw us a couple bones](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m41s)

[we'll manage the the stuff for you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m44s)

[there's going to be a handful of things](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m46s)

[that we put out here on Flow that are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m47s)

[going to start to be flow specific](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m49s)

[because when we control the back end uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m52s)

[we can make a lot of assumptions and do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m54s)

[a lot of extra stuff for you so the like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h06m56s)

[the other co the other stuff is there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m00s)

[for pushing like if you're going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m02s)

[manage it great people who have like an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m03s)

[on-prem solution or whatever right have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m05s)

[at it like this is probably not for you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m08s)

[yet um but this is going to be where we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m11s)

[end up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m14s)

[landing so but I have this thing so I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m16s)

[have an account of my own and normally](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m19s)

[under this account we would see some](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m22s)

[billing plans and whatnot but we have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m24s)

[this this is not good and this I I I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m27s)

[started looking at it uh previously and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m31s)

[I'm fairly confident I have a a decent](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m33s)

[idea of what's going wrong here but the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m36s)

[idea is that um well if we just F12 this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m38s)

[guy right and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m43s)

[we right if we go through and do this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m45s)

[right we can see this this call here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m48s)

[where we're pulling back payments based](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m50s)

[upon uh this ID is giving back a 404 no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m52s)

[bueno and I'm I'm fairly confident this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h07m57s)

[is because I have set this account up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m00s)

[with a custom plan right i designed the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m02s)

[back end even though there's kind of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m05s)

[like the built-in pricing models I left](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m07s)

[it open to where I could go through and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m09s)

[and toggle some switches uh and put](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m12s)

[people on these custom plans because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m15s)

[it's like you know what if a if an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m17s)

[enterprise or something comes to us and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m18s)

[says hey we want this we want to pay you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m20s)

[X number of dollars and we want Y great](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m21s)

[right i want to be able to fro the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m24s)

[switches and and make those numbers](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m25s)

[appear so that is that is where we are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m27s)

[going and then we're probably going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m30s)

[spend a little time updating this page](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m31s)

[because the the actual display of this I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m33s)

[think is dated and wrong we're going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m35s)

[try to fix all of that if we can that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m37s)

[the goal that's where we're going so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m39s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m43s)

[okay and then I'm going to grab this i'm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m44s)

[going bring this guy over here and then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m48s)

[we're going to open this sucker up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m50s)

[so my apologies this repository is not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m53s)

[open](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m56s)

[source but as the owner of it I grant my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h08m57s)

[permission to use it on stream okay now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m00s)

[that we are now that we've covered that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m03s)

[um but if anybody is interested like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m06s)

[this is Okay quick side quick side](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m08s)

[detour i absolutely love NetApp aspire](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m11s)

[net Aspirewah lovely lovely wonderful](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m14s)

[happy place um if you have not looked up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m17s)

[netpire](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m20s)

[um this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m23s)

[uh that is not net aspire this is netp](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m27s)

[aspire all right this is the this is the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m30s)

[happy place this is where we want to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m33s)

[um because netpire](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m36s)

[uh we are not even compiling](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m40s)

[uh I just need to put a value in here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m45s)

[real quick uh date time offset max value](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m48s)

[great that probably should be min value](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m53s)

[or something else but .NET Aspire gives](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m55s)

[you a lot of orchestration around](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h09m58s)

[building this up so this entire backend](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m00s)

[isn't just like a single web API right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m02s)

[you can see there's a bunch of projects](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m05s)

[in here i have some background](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m07s)

[processing stuff there's databases](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m08s)

[there's storage accounts there's lots of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m11s)

[moving parts that go along with this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m13s)

[right and so this guy fires up and then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m16s)

[I realize that I don't have my Docker](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m19s)

[host](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m20s)

[running which is why these things are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m21s)

[going to say unhealthy because my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m24s)

[database and uh Azureite are both](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m25s)

[launching as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m28s)

[containers and you cannot launch them as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m29s)

[containers if your Docker host is not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m32s)

[running you should absolutely start your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m35s)

[Docker host before before attempting to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m37s)

[run Net Aspire depending on what you're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m40s)

[launching right you saw some of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m43s)

[stuff fired up just fine because some of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m44s)

[my services I'm hosting outside of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m46s)

[containers some of them I have inside](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m48s)

[containers uh just based upon what I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m50s)

[felt made my life easiest because in an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m53s)

[ideal situation I like being able to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m56s)

[clone a repo hit F5 and get something](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h10m58s)

[like this right so you can see Azureite](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m01s)

[came up equal is thinking about itself](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m04s)

[and we'll probably come up here in a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m07s)

[moment probably going to take itself a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m09s)

[hot minute to get itself all updated and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m12s)

[running some images take a little while](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m14s)

[i'm watching it spin on my other monitor](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m16s)

[so while it thinks about it but like we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m19s)

[can get pretty graphs and say "Okay if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m21s)

[we want to talk about what all is is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m23s)

[going on inside of here this is it right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m25s)

[the Stripe web hook um I haven't figured](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m29s)

[out how to control this graph well](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m31s)

[enough technically there should be a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m33s)

[line from here to the API because that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m34s)

[what it does when you want to run Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m38s)

[locally but okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m40s)

[great anyway so if we go back to our](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m43s)

[resources there we go got everything up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m46s)

[payment processor finished](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m49s)

[errors what are the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m52s)

[errors](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m54s)

[uh oh yeah this is going to be an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m56s)

[interesting problem that I haven't quite](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h11m59s)

[figured out a good way of solving](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m00s)

[because when I run locally I am running](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m02s)

[against a Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m04s)

[sandbox so if we see things like this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m06s)

[don't worry these are not the production](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m09s)

[like Stripe subscription IDs these are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m11s)

[sandboxed ones um but because I dev on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m14s)

[more than one machine or if I blow my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m17s)

[local database](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m20s)

[away it means I I end up in a situation](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m22s)

[where where things don't quite So you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m25s)

[know this thing's doing the right thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m27s)

[like it's saying "Hey by the way this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m29s)

[team for this subscription is not found](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m31s)

[in the database." Well that's that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m33s)

[pretty conclusive it's not in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m35s)

[database probably because it was it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m37s)

[exists out in my Stripe sandbox but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m39s)

[doesn't exist in my local database so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m41s)

[huzzah uh okay front](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m43s)

[end okay i want to see if uh because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m47s)

[what I would like to do is get myself](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m50s)

[back into a similar situation in my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m52s)

[local database as what I have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h12m55s)

[remotely and then there's also an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m00s)

[endpoint that is dog slow](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m02s)

[that we might need to go through and do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m06s)

[this okay so I've got I've got a nothing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m08s)

[here so but let's go here if I go to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m13s)

[teams and I go teams and I go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m16s)

[billing okay so now we're just blowing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m20s)

[up straight up so that's that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m22s)

[exciting right so what's null here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m25s)

[subscription is null so null.created at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m28s)

[is bad so yeah so this is this is the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m31s)

[endpoint that is breaking so if we look](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m33s)

[briefly before](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m37s)

[my changes here all right so if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m40s)

[we just kind of gander over on let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m43s)

[do kind of want to let's just stash and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m48s)

[check out main real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m51s)

[quick if we look at main on this file](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m54s)

[what I'm what I'm fairly confident is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m57s)

[happening so this is the endpoint that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h13m59s)

[being hit with that gooid so the gooid](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m00s)

[in question is the team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m02s)

[identifier](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m04s)

[um which is fine like it's building up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m06s)

[all of this stuff but then we get into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m09s)

[this situation where it is uh 404ing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m10s)

[either because there's no subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m15s)

[lining up which is a distinct](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m17s)

[possibility because this is a custom](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m19s)

[plan there isn't going to be a record](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m21s)

[from Stripe in it right like that's one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m23s)

[of the weird things with this is it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m25s)

[very possible it's breaking there but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m27s)

[it's also possible that there is no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m29s)

[upcoming invoice coming back from Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m32s)

[either so both of those are possible](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m34s)

[because it's not like this is a real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m36s)

[plan it's a custom one that I just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m38s)

[slapped in so in both of these cases](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m40s)

[they're returning a not found but I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m42s)

[don't think either is accurate i think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m44s)

[what we actually want to do is build up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m45s)

[one of these payment details guys uh and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m48s)

[return it always and get rid of this not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m50s)

[found response so for people unfamiliar](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m53s)

[with this setup this is what is called](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m55s)

[net minimal APIs so in this case I have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h14m57s)

[mapped B in this case one slash payments](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m02s)

[slashte identifier to get payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m06s)

[details that's functionally how this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m08s)

[ends up going through and doing and then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m10s)

[we get this guy here okay that's where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m13s)

[we're at let's go forward because you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m16s)

[can see handle payment 404 i don't know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m17s)

[what my what was my pending change here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m19s)

[oh yeah the thing to make it actually](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m22s)

[compile right so this is this is where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m25s)

[we are currently at and if I paid](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m28s)

[attention to my obnoxious analyzer I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m30s)

[know that subscription can easily come](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m33s)

[through here as null so in this case](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m35s)

[what we need to do is make sure](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m39s)

[that in the null case so there are no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m44s)

[active subscriptions](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m46s)

[i think if there are no active](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m48s)

[subscriptions I almost want to get the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m50s)

[latest inactive](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m53s)

[one I think is almost what I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h15m57s)

[display](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m00s)

[instead um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m01s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m04s)

[because I'm just thinking if somebody](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m09s)

[subscribes unsubscribes comes back a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m11s)

[year later subscribes unsubscribes and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m13s)

[then views this page what probably makes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m16s)

[the most sense is to show them the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m19s)

[information from their last subscribe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m21s)

[unsubscribe i think probably what makes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m22s)

[the most sense uh because this is with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m25s)

[active subscriptions what is the query](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m28s)

[here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m30s)

[um yeah so this is intentionally doing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m34s)

[this and I think what we do is we just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m37s)

[get rid of this and I think we just do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m39s)

[an order by](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m41s)

[uh let's see order by descending](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m44s)

[X no that's not how you do a lambda you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m47s)

[[ __ ]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m50s)

[uh order by](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m52s)

[ending and then I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m56s)

[think first or default](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h16m59s)

[async](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m03s)

[and can actually just do subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m06s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m08s)

[um in this case and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m10s)

[then if this is the case](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m12s)

[here I think what's important is that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m15s)

[this becomes nullable because start and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m18s)

[end are both](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m21s)

[nullable which makes this much easier i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m22s)

[don't know if I need this empty anymore](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m25s)

[i'm not it's unused that was something I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m27s)

[was contemplating adding and I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m29s)

[think it's necessary so we'll do a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m30s)

[question mark there which then the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m32s)

[compiler jumps to the very next one goes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m34s)

["Will you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m35s)

[moron?" Okay so that gets me into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m37s)

[there and then this gets me all the way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m41s)

[to here so I would like I would like to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m44s)

[set this thing up and the other nice](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m47s)

[part about this project that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m48s)

[absolutely love is I have reasonably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m50s)

[good test coverage and I love my test](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m53s)

[coverage and it makes me feel warm and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m56s)

[fuzzy uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h17m57s)

[okay so we have Well let's run the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m00s)

[current test first i'm sure I've broken](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m04s)

[a handful of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m07s)

[these and then we'll we'll figure out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m09s)

[what needs to to adjust here because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m12s)

[most of these end points are fairly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m15s)

[simple and straightforward](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m17s)

[yeah so not surprisingly we've broken a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m27s)

[handful of things](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m30s)

[okay yeah so this one was specifically](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m32s)

[looking and expecting and not found we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m35s)

[have gotten rid of this so I don't think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m37s)

[we delete the test without](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m39s)

[subscriptions uh returns I think empty](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m44s)

[response so I think the key thing here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m49s)

[is we want this to still give us back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m51s)

[payment details but I need it to be give](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m54s)

[back useful payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m58s)

[details uh let's see here we're going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h18m59s)

[just put some bangs in make that guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m02s)

[shut up for a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m05s)

[moment uh oh I actually wanted that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m07s)

[whole line didn't I yep](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m10s)

[so rather than that we're going to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m15s)

[that because we always expect to get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m17s)

[back a full](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m19s)

[response so in this case we've set up a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m22s)

[team we've gotten rid of all of their](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m25s)

[subscriptions so this is the case where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m27s)

[they they just don't exist and then much](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m28s)

[as I hate doing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m32s)

[this at some point I want to kill off my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m36s)

[fluent assertions usage but that is that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m38s)

[is a different story](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m41s)

[uh okay so next bill](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m43s)

[uh should uh be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m48s)

[null would be what I would expect in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m51s)

[this case next bill](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m54s)

[amount this is another should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h19m57s)

[null uh be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m01s)

[null that gets rid of that subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m04s)

[start should](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m07s)

[uh be null and we do need to go and add](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m11s)

[subscription end to the other one and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m15s)

[payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m17s)

[card there's another one that should](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m18s)

[also be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m20s)

[null uh okay so that gets us to there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m21s)

[that gets us to there oh let's handle](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m25s)

[the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m27s)

[end let me just check real quick on the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m30s)

[diff](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m36s)

[uh yeah so subscription end being added](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m40s)

[and then a few a handful of things going](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m44s)

[nullable are the only changes let me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m46s)

[make that a little bit bigger oh it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m49s)

[visible i think those are the only two](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m51s)

[interesting changes there okay so that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m54s)

[goes like that that goes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h20m57s)

[there uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m01s)

[I don't think we need the bang on that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m06s)

[oh we do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m07s)

[do okay and so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m10s)

[uh description](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m18s)

[end should](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m21s)

[be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m25s)

[after okay let's make sure we haven't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m28s)

[botched this too](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m32s)

[badly because that is the nice part is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m34s)

[if all of my tests pass I just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m37s)

[ship because I have a high degree of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m40s)

[confidence that this thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m43s)

[is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m45s)

[working okay so that one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m47s)

[failed let's see if this one passes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m50s)

[because this one should be this one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m52s)

[should now be in a working state clearly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m54s)

[we did something wrong okay so this this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m55s)

[is working and then we need one more to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h21m59s)

[handle the other um case that we did but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m01s)

[let's look at the one that now is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m04s)

[failing uh let's see expected](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m06s)

[subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m09s)

[end which is but it was null so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m11s)

[subscription end didn't get properly set](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m14s)

[oh active subscriptions don't have an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m23s)

[end](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m26s)

[date](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m29s)

[right so that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m30s)

[uh should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m34s)

[after there not an or no there's not an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m37s)

[or I guess we'll just do be null i I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m45s)

[ideally what I'd like to do is write](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m48s)

[this assertion such that this test](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m50s)

[passes if it's null or after the current](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m53s)

[one because either one is valid because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m55s)

[one of the traps people fall fall into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h22m58s)

[is they write their tests hypersp](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m00s)

[specific towards the the code that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m02s)

[they're testing whereas I only care](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m05s)

[about if I'm getting payment details for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m08s)

[an existing subscription what is a valid](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m11s)

[return do not care about the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m14s)

[implementation I care only about what is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m16s)

[the the business level requirement for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m19s)

[that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m22s)

[and I'm going to leave a note here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m23s)

[um after UTC now is also valid that way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m29s)

[when I convert this over I I pick that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m35s)

[up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m38s)

[okay so the other case that is not being](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m39s)

[handled here so we've got with existing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m42s)

[without subscription Now we need uh with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m45s)

[expired](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m49s)

[subscription so that's that's now a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m51s)

[thing that we need to add in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m56s)

[with expired subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h23m58s)

[uh and I don't want to say returns empty](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m03s)

[response returns](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m09s)

[subscription details right so this guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m11s)

[here so this create when it does create](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m14s)

[team what does this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m17s)

[do why did I feel the urge on create](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m23s)

[team to site stripe subscriptions clear](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m26s)

[it's not like they get added](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m30s)

[to that must have just been me being](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m32s)

[paranoid um okay teamstripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m36s)

[subscriptions.add and we need to create](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m39s)

[Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m42s)

[subscription and then I guess the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m43s)

[question is what is what does this guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m45s)

[do here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m46s)

[um is null for an active](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m50s)

[subscription yeah so this is getting me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m54s)

[an active subscription and I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h24m57s)

[have it not be active so we are going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m00s)

[pull this out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m06s)

[var description we will do that and var](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m09s)

[is probably a bad choice here use](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m12s)

[explicit type and then pass subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m14s)

[but in this case what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m18s)

[pass subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m22s)

[uh end gets pass](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m25s)

[subscription start you're so close](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m28s)

[uh add days one so it's a very very](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m35s)

[short subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m41s)

[okay um is there anything else that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m46s)

[needs to be set to make this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m48s)

[accurate](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m54s)

[nope that looks pretty good to me okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h25m56s)

[so in this case fix my spelling mistake](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h26m01s)

[here the expectation so subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h26m04s)

[start should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h26m08s)

[uh before](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h26m11s)

[because I think it has lost its](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h28m38s)

[mind because that's clearly pointed at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h28m47s)

[subscription end i'm wondering if it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h28m50s)

[just lost mind in here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h28m52s)

[here be before now and after so it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h29m41s)

[this bit that failed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h29m45s)

[we expected it to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h29m49s)

[be why does it think start is on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h29m51s)

[52 that's like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h29m55s)

[now okay well let's look at this because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m02s)

[I've](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m05s)

[clearly done something](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m06s)

[wrong oh is this it here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m12s)

[yeah I did create it at not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m24s)

[start that is incorrect see this is why](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m27s)

[we write tests this is why we write](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m30s)

[tests because that would have been a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m33s)

[bug there we go now we're green okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m40s)

[show that gets us to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m45s)

[there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m47s)

[now I may look](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m49s)

[here i want I want to deal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m52s)

[with we should have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h30m58s)

[um let me do this analyze code coverage](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m03s)

[because I want to look at what what has](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m06s)

[been missed so far](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m08s)

[and then yeah code coverage is going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m17s)

[be trash but I only care about one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m18s)

[specific class so I don't really care](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m21s)

[about most of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m23s)

[it so I just want to look at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m32s)

[what's I'm not picking this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m34s)

[up service payments v1](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m37s)

[Uh oh I'm in the wrong name](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m44s)

[space uh API](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m47s)

[service why are these ones](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m50s)

[separated just wondering if I typed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h31m59s)

[something](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m01s)

[somewhere i don't see it if I did okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m03s)

[and then we are interested in get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m07s)

[payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m09s)

[details okay good so we've gotten key](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m13s)

[thing here for in case it's not obvious](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m17s)

[this all the blue things are lines that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m20s)

[were executed now code coverage is a bad](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m23s)

[metric to know when you're done right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m25s)

[because just because one of these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m28s)

[sections is blue does not mean it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m30s)

[tested it means it was executed as part](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m32s)

[of a test does not make it tested you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m34s)

[have to examine the test to know if it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m37s)

[actually tested but this section here I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m38s)

[know is not tested because it was not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m42s)

[executed so this is the other one that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m44s)

[needs to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m48s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m49s)

[so it's interesting to me that this line](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m51s)

[shows covered with this one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m54s)

[not that's shocking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h32m57s)

[uh merry Christmas Izzy uh we are we are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m04s)

[web](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m08s)

[APIing some stuff in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m09s)

[Vellopac](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m11s)

[um so at present we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m14s)

[are we are fixing a payment a payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m18s)

[details endpoint so that Velopac reports](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m21s)

[it back properly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m24s)

[um and I do not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m27s)

[have this handled](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m32s)

[properly so we need](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m35s)

[to Okay so code coverage what we do here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m38s)

[is we go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m40s)

[uh go away and die yeah and then we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m43s)

[need more test um so specifically what I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m48s)

[would like to test because down here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m52s)

[this is where I discovered with the new](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m54s)

[Stripe API that what do they call](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h33m57s)

[it there there's a word Stripe has where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m04s)

[you may not have card information if the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m07s)

[user didn't pay with a card now we only](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m10s)

[have a handful of payment options turned](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m13s)

[on but Stripe has a built-in one where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m15s)

[it's like um it's almost like ooth for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m18s)

[credit cards which is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m21s)

[because it means that the merchant](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m22s)

[doesn't see your card](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m24s)

[um but you still get to pay and it they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m26s)

[just facilitate the middle which is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m30s)

[which is nice but it means that when I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m31s)

[query the API to say "Hey show the user](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m33s)

[the last four digits that are card."](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m35s)

[Well there is no card there so I can't I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m36s)

[can't actually show anything so we just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m39s)

[default to show the payment method and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m41s)

[go I I don't know like that's all I can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m43s)

[do who listens to those code coverage](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m45s)

[metrics these days no no no you you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m47s)

[missed it Izzy just before you dropped](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m49s)

[in I I I had said like only the negative](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m51s)

[half of the code coverage metrics are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m55s)

[useful so everything that's red that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m56s)

[wasn't executed that's where I need to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h34m58s)

[write tests which is functionally this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m00s)

[little bit here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m02s)

[um and so I just need to set this guy up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m04s)

[with I don't know that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m08s)

[have I don't know that I ever set this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m11s)

[thing yeah I didn't ever set up anything](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m14s)

[on this query here as well because this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m16s)

[service is really a leaky abstraction so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m20s)

[the the objects that are and by leaky](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m24s)

[abstraction what I mean is the objects](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m27s)

[returned out of this stripe service](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m28s)

[interface this is literally just here as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m30s)

[a very thin wrapper so that I can write](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m32s)

[tests without actually hitting stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m34s)

[right integration test will hit the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m37s)

[test uh sandbox on stripe to verify](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m40s)

[things work but for purposes of unit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m43s)

[testing and I use the word loosely here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m46s)

[this is just here as a seam in the code](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m49s)

[to be able to go through and do it and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m50s)

[by leaky abstraction what I mean](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m52s)

[is when you return back a concrete](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m54s)

[Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m58s)

[subscription it means I haven't actually](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h35m59s)

[like isolated Stripe from the rest of my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m01s)

[codebase anybody using this interface is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m03s)

[still going to have a using Stripe in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m06s)

[the that section of the code and is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m08s)

[still going to be using strongly typed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m10s)

[Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m12s)

[objects right now leaky abstraction can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m13s)

[be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m18s)

[bad but part of the fun is knowing when](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m19s)

[when to violate the the coding](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m21s)

[guidelines as a very famous pirate once](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m24s)

[said what it would Oh shoot now I'm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m27s)

[going to mess it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m28s)

[up uh shoot something about guidelines](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m31s)

[and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m34s)

[rules who listens man my auto incorrect](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m36s)

[is trying to be on point today james](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m40s)

[still seems to be half](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m43s)

[asleep oh that's awesome Izzy that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m44s)

[awesome okay so let's go here uh without](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m47s)

[uh uh upcoming invoice actually why did](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m52s)

[my first one not show an upcoming](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m56s)

[invoice](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h36m59s)

[setup this is coming back with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m05s)

[information how is this one getting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m10s)

[back did I Did I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m14s)

[Huh this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m17s)

[worked how did this come Okay I got to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m20s)

[look at what the response was here how](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m22s)

[did this come back with like next bill](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m24s)

[amount](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m27s)

[if like upcoming invoice should have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m33s)

[been null](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m36s)

[that's clearly not null and it looks a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m42s)

[heck of a lot like uh the fact that the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m44s)

[value is 42 seems like uh Kevin put in a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m47s)

[fake response but where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m50s)

[did where did past Kevin do that put a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m53s)

[breakpoint in the end point and just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m57s)

[grab it there where did I do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h37m59s)

[that because I don't see a setup for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m02s)

[setting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m05s)

[the upcoming](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m07s)

[invoice oh I wonder if I have a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m12s)

[simulator that just hardcodes a response](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m15s)

[that would be potentially dumb](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m18s)

[right so we got a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m23s)

[subscription that returned to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m30s)

[value oh look at that look at that i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m33s)

[don't know if anybody could see it i saw](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m37s)

[the word simulator in the hard to see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m38s)

[simulator right there dang it i shot](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m41s)

[myself in the foot that's what I did](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m44s)

[okay let's go let's go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m46s)

[spelunking get upcoming invoice well](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m50s)

[doesn't that just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m54s)

[bite so the short version so rather than](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h38m56s)

[So this is I guess kind of a weird](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m00s)

[statement to make but I'll go through](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m02s)

[and make it it is often advantageous to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m03s)

[not use](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m07s)

[mocks because when you use a mock](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m08s)

[you you're you're only as good as the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m12s)

[setups that you put on it and quite](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m14s)

[often unless you do some extra work](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m17s)

[those setups are only being reused on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m19s)

[that one test and so if you spend time](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m22s)

[getting a mock working](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m24s)

[properly it can be better to just write](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m26s)

[an actual implement a a second](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m29s)

[implementation of your interface and use](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m32s)

[it inside your test which is what this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m34s)

[guy is doing here this one is fairly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m35s)

[loose but it has some sort of uh plans](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m38s)

[by ID to be able to link things through](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m40s)

[pull it out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m43s)

[um and I think this is this is really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m45s)

[what I what I just need to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m49s)

[um I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m54s)

[here is change this sucker up so that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h39m57s)

[can actually um control him a little](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m00s)

[better because at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m04s)

[where this is coming from is this uh web](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m05s)

[application](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m08s)

[factory uh this guy here has a lot of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m10s)

[setups and I'm sure one of these is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m13s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m15s)

[be setting up that lovely little guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m16s)

[there i'm looking for him i'm looking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m22s)

[for him i'm sure he is around here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m25s)

[somewhere on one of these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m27s)

[setups service](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m30s)

[descripture just hunt this guy out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m33s)

[there's only three references he](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m36s)

[couldn't have gotten far](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m37s)

[there we go web application factory](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m41s)

[configure host add singleton simulator](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m43s)

[stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m45s)

[service so there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m46s)

[is there's the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m49s)

[guy there is the guy okay so back in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m52s)

[test what we want to do we want to come](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m55s)

[back here so this is fine this is this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m57s)

[is working as designed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h40m59s)

[see I just finished building my test uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m02s)

[simulators using Raspberry Pi and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m05s)

[finally found out the reason our](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m06s)

[previous tests were failing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m09s)

[ah was it because the previous tests had](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m11s)

[an implementation of an interface or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m16s)

[some other seam that was not behaving](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m19s)

[like the real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m21s)

[one uh let's see and it had nothing to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m23s)

[do with what I thought it was now the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m25s)

[simulator](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m27s)

[box uh could not have been built](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m28s)

[really that is interesting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m33s)

[like it always fascinates me like I I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m37s)

[actually really enjoy when I get a bug](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m41s)

[report and I'm able to track it down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m43s)

[just just from the report by like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m45s)

[figuring out how to make how to almost](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m48s)

[like mold the system into the failure](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m51s)

[case i find that rather fun it's it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m53s)

[fun when you can solve it it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m57s)

[frustrating when you can't or it behaves](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h41m58s)

[in a weird way and just doesn't do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m01s)

[things consistently and then you just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m03s)

[pull your hair out and then you become](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m04s)

[bald](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m06s)

[is it was pretending to be the real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m08s)

[device 100%](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m11s)

[correctly that sounds like a good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m14s)

[simulator izzy I'm guessing you expected](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m18s)

[Yeah I'm going to go with that the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m20s)

[expectation was not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m22s)

[that and that was the problem](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m26s)

[interesting uh let's see factory and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m31s)

[then I think I want to do where how do I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m33s)

[get my services back out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m36s)

[uh there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m39s)

[are local storage remove test](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m44s)

[logger services that's what I would like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m48s)

[get required service and then I would](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m52s)

[like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m55s)

[the simulators](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h42m56s)

[dot no that one that is what I would](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m00s)

[like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m05s)

[okay what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m09s)

[oh interesting i've got two simulator](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m19s)

[name spaces and they're colliding with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m23s)

[each other that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m25s)

[is that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m28s)

[lovely that is absolutely lovely we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m33s)

[going to alias it because there's not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m37s)

[conflicting types in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m39s)

[there let's see uh two interfaces were](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m40s)

[trying to be the same IP address so only](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m43s)

[one of them ever worked until rebooted](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m45s)

[oh that's that's dirty i like that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m52s)

[that's a good one that is a very good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h43m55s)

[one so what was the uh I guess trigger](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m06s)

[then where where you finally realized](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m09s)

[that was what was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m12s)

[happening was it just a an aha moment or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m13s)

[did you end up like catching an issue](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m18s)

[where it's like two things tried to bind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m20s)

[to the same](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m22s)

[address um let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m26s)

[here uh stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m30s)

[service uh okay and then I want to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m33s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m36s)

[uh Stripe service](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m38s)

[uh set up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m41s)

[subscription and I think that's really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m45s)

[all I want to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m47s)

[is I just want to have some way to tell](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m49s)

[the service hey there here's the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m51s)

[subscription that I want to set](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m53s)

[up uh okay because and then I think I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m56s)

[want to just pull data](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h44m59s)

[uh stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m03s)

[subscription we'll just do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m10s)

[that and I think we're just going to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m15s)

[this one over here this this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m18s)

[this because this will go through](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m25s)

[that'll pull that back out and then I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m27s)

[guess the question is what do we want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m29s)

[do we want to set](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m30s)

[this so one of the things I often enjoy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m33s)

[do doing is writing the API that I want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m36s)

[and then I'll go actually implement it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m40s)

[i'm just trying to decide what I want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m42s)

[here because I want to set this thing up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m45s)

[without an upcoming invoice so I I kind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m48s)

[of want to change the service so it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m50s)

[doesn't just blindly return back a new](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m52s)

[upcoming invoice every time and instead](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m54s)

[it requires someone to do this sort of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h45m56s)

[setup and method i think that's probably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m03s)

[okay right so inside of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m07s)

[here we're going to give](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m11s)

[ourselves another dictionary I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m14s)

[guess uh let's see private dictionary](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m18s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m22s)

[subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m25s)

[uh this is now where we can start](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m29s)

[actually giving ourselves nice](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m31s)

[uh nice APIs to play with okay so down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m33s)

[here get active](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m39s)

[subscriptions so this is just going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m42s)

[be return subscriptions dot values](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m44s)

[uh guess what we can do is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m50s)

[this for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m53s)

[each](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m55s)

[varcription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h46m59s)

[in and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m03s)

[then just yield](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m04s)

[returns](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m07s)

[description and then await task yield](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m11s)

[what are you complaining about oh we are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m18s)

[in here let's see it all worked on my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m21s)

[machine but I never had all the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m23s)

[interface cables attached to a simulator](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m25s)

[box at the same time ended up doing that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m27s)

[and used Wireshark to find the IP config](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m30s)

[part of the handshake was being returned](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m32s)

[on the wrong interface only took me six](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m35s)

[months to figure out i needed a test](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m38s)

[specific IP address for each interface](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m41s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m44s)

[dang uh let's see this is I async](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m52s)

[enumemeral what's your problem](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h47m56s)

[here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m01s)

[oh just made it a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m02s)

[task dang Izzy that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m06s)

[is That's rough that is rough though I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m09s)

[will say it is it is always](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m13s)

[interesting being able to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m15s)

[track that stuff down uh let's see what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m18s)

[are you trying to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m22s)

[say is this parameter named team ID the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m24s)

[message](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m28s)

[uh that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m31s)

[yeah empty hate throwing a no uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m37s)

[argument null exception when something's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m40s)

[not null okay so get upcoming](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m42s)

[invoice and actually I guess what we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m45s)

[going to do here is we're going to go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m47s)

[with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m50s)

[subscriptions stop this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m53s)

[subs come on come on and we're just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m55s)

[going to go subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h48m59s)

[id subscription call it a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m02s)

[day what is your problem is that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m05s)

[nullable or something oh it's a gooid](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m07s)

[interesting oh because this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m13s)

[mine so it's not actually ID it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m17s)

[subscription ID that I want to feed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m19s)

[it um but this is a stripe subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m25s)

[not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m30s)

[Oh right because I have to be able to go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m36s)

[between my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m40s)

[object and this stripe one do I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m41s)

[set up the stripe one or do I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m45s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m48s)

[mine probably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m51s)

[both probably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m55s)

[both let's see private](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h49m58s)

[static uh subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m01s)

[to stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m04s)

[subscription this is only going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m08s)

[become more more](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m10s)

[interesting okay that'll get me to there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m13s)

[that'll get me to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m17s)

[there that API goes here and now we can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m18s)

[just return new](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m22s)

[subscription now the question is what do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m24s)

[we populate on here right right so what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m26s)

[do we actually Oh hang on was co-pilot](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m30s)

[going to do it all for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m31s)

[me oh co-pilot you are freaking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m38s)

[insane that's remarkably good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m47s)

[that is remarkably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h50m57s)

[good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m03s)

[wow oh good job the hardware has issues](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m10s)

[and is nine months delayed yeah I did](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m13s)

[you did a good job i didn't say the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m16s)

[project was good i don't know anything](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m18s)

[about the project](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m19s)

[okay so start at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m23s)

[um I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m27s)

[am somewhat interested in my mapping](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m30s)

[going the other way to make sure that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m33s)

[this simulator actually works properly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m34s)

[this isn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m37s)

[there ended](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m39s)

[at we want to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m41s)

[[Applause]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m43s)

[that do you require you do require a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m47s)

[value cancelled at should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m52s)

[nullable we're not going to we're not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m56s)

[going to set it unless it's set there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h51m58s)

[what else we got what else we got](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m01s)

[hanging out here so flow plan ID](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m03s)

[customer subscription has billing issues](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m05s)

[is a different property last modified](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m08s)

[created at and currency key okay so that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m10s)

[is good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m13s)

[i don't know that I know enough to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m17s)

[populate this items right here we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m18s)

[just going to whack this because we we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m22s)

[don't need it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m24s)

[so minimum viable for the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m26s)

[moment uh let's see and then this here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m30s)

[we're just going to implement as a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m37s)

[if uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m38s)

[subcriptions uh yeah exactly what you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m42s)

[said co-pilot thank](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m45s)

[you see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m48s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h52m50s)

[uh got to clarify what it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m01s)

[is it has no idea what it's doing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m05s)

[okay me there oh you probably want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m08s)

[collapse this don't you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m11s)

[h I don't know how much I like that but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m13s)

[whatever we'll let it live we'll let it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m16s)

[live i assume it wants to do the same](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m18s)

[thing here yeah oh yuck okay if you're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m20s)

[going to do it at least do them](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m24s)

[consistently co-pilot don't Don't make](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h53m25s)

[yeah so now that means I've just broken](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m13s)

[some stuff because hopefully my my first](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m16s)

[test that was working fails and now my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m18s)

[work](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m31s)

[right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m32s)

[um this needs to not return an upcoming](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m34s)

[invoice if it is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m37s)

[ended uh so this actually needs to be a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m40s)

[try](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m42s)

[get so this is going to go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m52s)

[down bring you up format and everyone's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m55s)

[happy okay makes it all nice and pretty](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h54m58s)

[and it just works the way we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m02s)

[want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m05s)

[okay uh let's see and uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m08s)

[subscription ended](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m14s)

[at is null](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m16s)

[or greater than datetime offset UT yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m22s)

[will you not let me get away with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m28s)

[that oh date](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m35s)

[time it's probably not going to let me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m39s)

[because it wants a constant](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m41s)

[h ended at is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m43s)

[null or subscription ended at I am not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m46s)

[going to be a [ __ ]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m51s)

[runs around](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m54s)

[that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m56s)

[okay so if there is no ended](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h55m59s)

[at or the ended at is in the future we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m03s)

[will create an upcoming invoice now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m07s)

[there is a little bit of a disjoint in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m09s)

[that this upcoming invoice like if the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m11s)

[ended ad is in 3](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m13s)

[minutes this guy's doing a a next](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m16s)

[payment attempt in 20 days but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m19s)

[that's that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m21s)

[okay um okay so that'll get us there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m23s)

[let's run](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m27s)

[this okay surprised my other one passed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m33s)

[because I don't think this is corre I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m37s)

[don't think this assertion is correct](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m39s)

[yet uh without upcoming invoice returns](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m40s)

[previous subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m43s)

[details uh actually because we copied](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m45s)

[from the other one it is correct because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m48s)

[the next bill amount should be null in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m50s)

[this case](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m52s)

[okay and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h56m59s)

[then subscription start should be before](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m01s)

[Yeah so because of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m06s)

[this and actually I guess setting up a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m14s)

[subscription in the old case so okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m17s)

[because we're about to break the other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m19s)

[side okay that I guess I'm okay with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m21s)

[because right here this is working like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m24s)

[this is one thing I've always wished for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m28s)

[i want something to do fuzz testing at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m30s)

[some point where it kind of just tweaks](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m33s)

[your code and sees what breaks right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m36s)

[because my favorite thing is if I can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m38s)

[delete a line of code from a test and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m39s)

[the test still passes how important was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m41s)

[that line of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m43s)

[code](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m44s)

[so yeah so we're going to leave that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m51s)

[there for a moment let's go fix the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m53s)

[broken one and then we'll come back and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m54s)

[think about it have a good solid think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m56s)

[on it so this one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h57m58s)

[here and I'm going to give](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m00s)

[me the required service back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m03s)

[out so this guy here get payment details](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m06s)

[with existing subscription returns](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m09s)

[details this is failing because it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m11s)

[doesn't know anything about the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m13s)

[subscription and so here what I need to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m15s)

[do is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m18s)

[uh stripe service setup subscription and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m20s)

[I want to go with em stripe subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m23s)

[single and this should now make this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m28s)

[pass again now this is registered inside](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m30s)

[of the simulator the simulator does the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m34s)

[needful and this guy should just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m35s)

[work there we go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m41s)

[so he now passes without subscription we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m44s)

[don't call](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m48s)

[it without expired](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m49s)

[subscription i can't type with expired](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m54s)

[subscription because if it is because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h58m58s)

[that's what we want to test with expired](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m00s)

[subscription and so I think I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m03s)

[grab](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m06s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m07s)

[copy come down here and we go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m09s)

[uh paste](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m14s)

[uh that line](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m21s)

[paste here we go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m24s)

[that should still be in a passing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m31s)

[state yeah I'm a little torn here little](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m43s)

[torn um but it does make it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m48s)

[all work the way we expect and now we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m53s)

[have tests covering all the things so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=00h59m57s)

[that should solve our](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m00s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m04s)

[um because this is the case that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m10s)

[believe we are hitting on my current](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m13s)

[prod one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m15s)

[so let's run this guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m18s)

[stage](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m25s)

[stage](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m27s)

[stage oh we should rerun all the tests](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m30s)

[real quick because we just modified an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m32s)

[underlying simulator that could break a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m34s)

[lot of things in a lot of places](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m36s)

[probably not in this case given how few](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m38s)

[usages I saw of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m40s)

[it because some of my stuff uses mocks](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m44s)

[to hide that away so it there's a real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m47s)

[chance that a lot of it just isn't being](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m49s)

[exercised but I want to see that thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m52s)

[go so while that thing's going we'll](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m55s)

[build this up auto code the message for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h00m57s)

[me pretty please thank](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m00s)

[you uh let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m16s)

[oh stop it you're in the way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m18s)

[uh can't spell uh let's see uh and no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m23s)

[upcoming it now returns details uh if no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m27s)

[active one is found and there is no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m30s)

[subscription to also introduced box](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m32s)

[strike service no that is a lie bad](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m34s)

[AI other than that you did pretty good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m39s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m42s)

[AI uh let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m43s)

[here so what did what happened so this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m47s)

[is that for a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m51s)

[moment uh we picked up an extra Oh we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m53s)

[did not pick up we dropped a 404](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m56s)

[response on the payments API that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h01m59s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m02s)

[and then the change to the payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m04s)

[details is next bill amount is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m07s)

[nullable payment card is now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m11s)

[nullable subscription start is nullable](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m15s)

[and subscription end is being added okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m18s)

[good i accept all of these changes so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m20s)

[this is the most](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m23s)

[obnoxious thing out there but it means](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m26s)

[every](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m30s)

[API change I have to explicitly approve](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m31s)

[so for better or worse I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m36s)

[accidentally release any](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m38s)

[APIs or at least any public facing API](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m41s)

[changes and that's part of why we want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m48s)

[to get this all working because Once I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m50s)

[ship this then I really can't make](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m53s)

[breaking API](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m55s)

[changes okay so we're going to take](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h02m56s)

[that stage amend](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m00s)

[amend uh let's see and then let's PR](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m04s)

[that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m07s)

[beast oh see I was ready for you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m11s)

[got them okay uh let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m31s)

[see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m34s)

[updating get payment details](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m36s)

[this fixes the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m41s)

[end return 44 and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m44s)

[instead returns empty](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m48s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m51s)

[data okay send](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m54s)

[it and then we're going to come](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h03m57s)

[here looking too much that auto merge](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m01s)

[squash automerge squash and off to the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m05s)

[races okay we're going to let that guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m07s)

[go for a moment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m09s)

[and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m11s)

[then let's go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m13s)

[have little look see at the front end](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m15s)

[while that guy is while that guy's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m19s)

[chugging so the front end technically](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m27s)

[lives in a separate repository](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m30s)

[um partly because of deployment reasons](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m33s)

[and similar](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m36s)

[um we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m38s)

[gonna take a look at this and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m40s)

[see oh monitor here waiting for it okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m44s)

[so if we go to my local front end where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m48s)

[is it there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h04m53s)

[i will say there is something I I do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m00s)

[want to look into how long some of these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m02s)

[things take because it feels bit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m04s)

[excessive at times and I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m06s)

[fully understand why that's that load](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m08s)

[time is there okay so if I go here I go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m11s)

[my teams I click here and I go billing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m14s)

[right so this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m17s)

[um surprised that this thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m22s)

[shows](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m25s)

[this i thought I was going to see more](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m27s)

[oh this is the page here got it current](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m30s)

[plan right upgrade so these are ones](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m34s)

[that we want to change up because this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m38s)

[was just slapped in based upon what we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m41s)

[initially thought](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h05m43s)

[developer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m20s)

[plan developer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m21s)

[bits uh let's put the bandwidth next to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m32s)

[the other one let's see bandwidth is 50](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m36s)

[gigs 30 gigs of storage three projects](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m39s)

[one team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m43s)

[member none of the other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m44s)

[stuff so the big difference between free](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m47s)

[and dev is just more storage and for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m50s)

[anybody watching this these numbers are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m53s)

[somewhat subject to change okay these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m55s)

[are these are where they currently sit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m57s)

[but we have a task on our go live board](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h10m59s)

[to review these numbers and see if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h11m02s)

[there's anything that needs to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h11m04s)

[here cuz these were using let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h20m54s)

[see we have primary](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h20m57s)

[secondary and then there's actually just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m03s)

[a hard-coded one in for the free plan](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m05s)

[because there isn't a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m08s)

[good a good option in there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m09s)

[the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m29s)

[Okay uh there is an issue](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m32s)

[with the spacing there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m36s)

[why did I mess up how did I get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h21m39s)

[have the button look to it or not this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h23m05s)

[feels wrong but at the same](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h23m08s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h23m15s)

[okay i think that's okay okay so let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h23m17s)

[go back here uh and now I got to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h23m19s)

[more here we go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h23m41s)

[check on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m06s)

[our](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m08s)

[release that went out the door huzzah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m10s)

[i got decent line coverage](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m14s)

[88% makes me feel kind of good branch](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m16s)

[coverage little lacking little](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m19s)

[lacking but like I dive into the details](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m21s)

[and I don't care like most of the stuff](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m24s)

[that's uncovered is stuff that I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m25s)

[care about or it's like "Oh that's test](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m28s)

[stuff."](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m30s)

[Um yeah JC have you priced out giving](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m31s)

[the 10 gigs of free space yeah so we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m34s)

[actually have um and the storage is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m38s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m42s)

[not what I what I'm what I'm somewhat](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m43s)

[worried about the and we we still need](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m47s)

[to settle on exactly how much we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m50s)

[going to charge for each of the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m52s)

[pricing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m54s)

[plans part of it was we we don't want we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h24m55s)

[don't want our free tier to suck right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m00s)

[like both me and Kaylin are developers](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m02s)

[and at the end of the day like nobody](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m05s)

[wants a bad thing like I want to have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m09s)

[something that I'm proud to show people](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m11s)

[and say "Yeah like go give the free tier](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m12s)

[a try." Because the the products that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m15s)

[use that have a decent free tier for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m18s)

[people to like get a good handle on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m20s)

[versus the ones that just it's like you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m23s)

[hit the limitations immediately those](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m25s)

[always just feel bad so like 10 gigs of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m27s)

[storage a month um uh I think a single](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m31s)

[prouser yeah and we may end up lowering](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m38s)

[it like I but I'm I I need to go back to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m40s)

[our spreadsheet i think with a single](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m43s)

[prouser if I I think for every pro user](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m47s)

[it can offset the cost of I think like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m52s)

[650 free tier users so there may like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m54s)

[and maybe we start it lower and then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h25m59s)

[bump it up if it's not if it's not being](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m01s)

[as bad but I I it's something like that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m04s)

[i think one paying customer offsets](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m06s)

[uh don't get bad publicity yeah and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m10s)

[that's the thing is we may dial it down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m12s)

[that we do have because again all of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m14s)

[these numbers subject to change we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m16s)

[going to go back over everything before](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m18s)

[we go live to to say is this actually](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m19s)

[what we want to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m22s)

[um I just realized this has an X](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m27s)

[here i don't think that's right is it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m33s)

[uh where did](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m37s)

[my um but yeah it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m39s)

[it but yeah so it is absolutely a thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m43s)

[on our radar of this may be this may be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m46s)

[a little much because I'm just looking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m48s)

[at like the apps that I want to host on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m50s)

[here like the material design demo app](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m52s)

[that's one that I plan on hosting here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m56s)

[and I would like to put it on uh a free](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h26m58s)

[tier and given that it's an open source](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m01s)

[thing um that's something that should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m03s)

[there one of the things that we expect](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m05s)

[is with the the paid plans one of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m09s)

[things that we want to implement is like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m12s)

[automatic retention policy stuff so that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m13s)

[people can say you know what I want you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m16s)

[know I want to more effectively manage](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m18s)

[you know my 30 gigs of storage let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m20s)

[drop things off that are older than two](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m22s)

[years um in the same order i thought I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m24s)

[did release storage download bandwidth](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m27s)

[projects members release](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m31s)

[storage oh you're right this one is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m35s)

[different](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m38s)

[okay good good call out there good call](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m40s)

[out there let me go fix that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m48s)

[why so the without partial puts in the x](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h27m58s)

[full okay I see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m04s)

[um why do we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m07s)

[have these two are the same so they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m14s)

[should look the same](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m18s)

[i'm actually not sold on the X's on the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m23s)

[team member one that that gives me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m26s)

[pause yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m31s)

[um okay but let me go and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m33s)

[put this one because you are right this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m37s)

[should go up at the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m41s)

[top and then projects team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m43s)

[members i think this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m48s)

[one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m51s)

[uh oh Hazen great great great great and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m53s)

[watching the recordings on YouTube um my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h28m58s)

[YouTube automation broke and I was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m01s)

[actually working on it again](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m03s)

[i I probably should just bite the bullet](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m06s)

[and because I've got my Twitch](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m09s)

[recordings downloaded for like the last](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m11s)

[local just so I don't lose anything but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m15s)

[I have not uploaded to YouTube because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m18s)

[my automation broke and in typical dev](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m21s)

[fashion I'm fixing that rather than um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m23s)

[just manually uploading](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m27s)

[them there i think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m29s)

[that that feels a little better we may](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m31s)

[want to change these icons up but at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m35s)

[least at least that gets it in and gets](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m37s)

[that in and going okay let me go back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m40s)

[send the last one i did okay uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h29m53s)

[boom yesesh uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m00s)

[fixing payment plan cards so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m08s)

[information is in the same](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m13s)

[order i actually saw a post Eisen on uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m17s)

[LinkedIn last week it was trying to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m21s)

[remember how it was phrased it was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m24s)

[something along the lines of if a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m25s)

[developer can explain dependency](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m26s)

[injection that was one of the bars](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m28s)

[between like junior and senior engineer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m31s)

[so you wrapped your head around it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m34s)

[congratulations you're moving up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m36s)

[i will say with dependency injection](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m41s)

[there is this nagging thing in the back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m43s)

[of my mind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m45s)

[that like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m49s)

[why and I know it may sound weird and a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m53s)

[little uh kind of off the cuff but we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h30m56s)

[have dependency injection to just uh see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m01s)

[you JC thank you for the feedback I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m04s)

[appreciate it we have dependency](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m05s)

[injection for the idea of being able to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m07s)

[inject our](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m09s)

[dependencies so that we have seams in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m10s)

[our code so that we can do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m13s)

[testing right like that's that's the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m15s)

[fundamental reason because you know we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m18s)

[like uh loose coupling tight cohesion](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m22s)

[that therefore we need these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m25s)

[dependencies and therefore it's like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m27s)

[dependency injection is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m29s)

[the the logical](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m32s)

[conclusion of of things higher up in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m34s)

[stream and I've been constantly thinking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m38s)

[about that of and and I'm sure this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m40s)

[the the epitome of the XKCD of you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m42s)

[you've got three competing standards](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m44s)

[let's do it better now there's four](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m46s)

[competing standards but I I I keep](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m47s)

[having this thing in the back of my mind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m50s)

[of it'd be really great if that if that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m51s)

[wasn't necessary in a lot of cases right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m56s)

[like we don't want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h31m59s)

[to we don't want to write bad](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m01s)

[code but I I feel like I can write](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m04s)

[fairly decent maintainable code without](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m07s)

[these extra layers of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m10s)

[abstraction and it would be but I the at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m13s)

[least the language and the the runtimes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m16s)

[don't have a a good way around that kind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m18s)

[of thing so it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m20s)

[like yeah uh okay so the other thing I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m21s)

[want to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m25s)

[I'm going to take this i'm going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m28s)

[stash everything I have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m30s)

[here and then inside of this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m33s)

[guy cuz our I I believe my release made](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m37s)

[it all the way out let me just make](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m41s)

[sure yay release shipped okay good okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m44s)

[so my release made it all the way out i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m48s)

[would like to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m51s)

[update my back or my front end so that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m53s)

[it has all the latest stuff and I got to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h32m56s)

[remember where that lives is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m00s)

[it is it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m05s)

[here there is where is the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m08s)

[magical should have written it down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m15s)

[um that's just that we didn't we didn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m17s)

[ever document that where is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m21s)

[the config](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m23s)

[that you can use to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m26s)

[run one of the commands that will regen](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m30s)

[all of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m34s)

[APIs and I don't remember where it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m37s)

[lives and now I feel dumb](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m41s)

[uh let's just search open](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m44s)

[API i think it's in there somewhere](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m46s)

[uh yeah it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h33m52s)

[that yeah being able to easily swap out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m00s)

[different implementations though Izzy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m02s)

[let me ask how often has that actually](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m04s)

[worked right like I I and again that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m07s)

[goes back to the idea of what we really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m10s)

[want is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m11s)

[uh loose coupling so that we can swap](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m13s)

[those things out right because you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m15s)

[for example I'm using Stripe as my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m18s)

[payment processor for this maybe down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m20s)

[the road we decide hey I don't want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m22s)

[use Stripe for my payment processor i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m24s)

[want to use something else and so I want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m26s)

[my code to not like I don't want Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m30s)

[to like infest my codebase to where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m33s)

[doing that swap is painful right i want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m35s)

[that that logical](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m37s)

[separation but I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m40s)

[know i I it feels like I you you put](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m44s)

[those layers of abstraction in and you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m48s)

[and there's a lot of overhead with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m50s)

[maintaining those layers that don't that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m52s)

[don't add a ton of value and that's the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m55s)

[part that that always gets me is there's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h34m58s)

[all these layers so that we can do these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m00s)

[things and I I it feels I don't know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m05s)

[i've seen a couple a couple other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m09s)

[languages and frameworks where there's a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m11s)

[lot less](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m13s)

[boilerplate](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m14s)

[um and it it just I don't know you're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m16s)

[using abstraction doesn't mean you need](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m20s)

[to do DI no completely agree right like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m21s)

[dependency ejection I think is the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m24s)

[culmination of of getting to that point](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m26s)

[of being able to separate things out and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m30s)

[I came across kind of similar things](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m32s)

[because for a while um I was working uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m34s)

[with an architect that was a domain](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m37s)

[driven design wizard he absolutely loved](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m39s)

[it right and regardless of where people](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m42s)

[come down on DDD right like that like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m44s)

[there it adds a lot of layers of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m47s)

[abstraction a lot so for for people who](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m49s)

[haven't seen this term before](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m53s)

[um like there is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h35m58s)

[uh where's I just want an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m01s)

[image](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m04s)

[yeah oh no i just uh open image in new](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m06s)

[tab](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m11s)

[um this is kind of okay but that's not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m13s)

[really what I was looking for there's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m16s)

[there's some more nicer images that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m18s)

[break down all of the components of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m20s)

[domain driven design into their](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m23s)

[constituent parts with the aggregates](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m25s)

[and all of that stuff in there in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m27s)

[repositories and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m29s)

[it's and it it adds a lot and there and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m31s)

[its purpose is really like it starts](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m35s)

[from the idea of getting the right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m38s)

[language and then it builds out from](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m40s)

[there right and I think this is where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m43s)

[some of the AI folks may have they may](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m45s)

[be on to something in the the idea that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m48s)

[domain driven design starts with getting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m51s)

[a good handle on language and making](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m53s)

[sure that everybody's communicating](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m55s)

[properly and okay we're going to make](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m57s)

[things that actually match the business](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h36m59s)

[case and but then it wraps in all these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m01s)

[extra abstractions on top of it which](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m04s)

[make and make it feel problematic and it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m07s)

[and maybe that's the the the ultimate](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m10s)

[solution is at the point where we can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m13s)

[code at that higher level it works](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m17s)

[really well](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m19s)

[right i don't know feel like I'm very](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m21s)

[meta at the moment yeah I use DI for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m24s)

[dynamically loading dependencies for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m27s)

[plugins my tools have the ability to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m28s)

[hotload plugins yeah and see in those](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m30s)

[types of situations like it makes really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m32s)

[good sense right the abstraction has to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m34s)

[be there because it's being uh spread](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m38s)

[out uh it's a bit like a CI/CD agent](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m40s)

[thing yeah no and I think that makes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m45s)

[sense but I'm just thinking of things of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m48s)

[like I'll just drag this in right like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m52s)

[and I I'll I'll pick on my own code](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m56s)

[because why not right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h37m58s)

[like I have a very simplistic method](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m01s)

[here and I don't have a lot of layers of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m04s)

[abstraction right like I'm not I I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m07s)

[hide away my DB context because I treat](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m09s)

[the EF core DB context as an abstraction](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m12s)

[already so let's not make it worse right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m14s)

[i've got uh an abstraction over my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m17s)

[Stripe service which is admittedly a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m20s)

[leaky](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m21s)

[abstraction because it it definitely](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m22s)

[lets some of the Stripe stuff slip back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m24s)

[all the way up to here so which it was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m27s)

[one of those I made I made a conscious](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m30s)

[decision for it to be a leaky](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m33s)

[abstraction of yes I could abstract this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m34s)

[further no I'm not interested in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m37s)

[maintaining that extra layer this isn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m39s)

[going to be used in that many places](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m41s)

[right billing is kind of isolated at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m43s)

[present into only a handful of chunks](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m45s)

[it's like you know what if and when we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m48s)

[swap payment processors I understand my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m50s)

[blast radius is a little bigger I'm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m52s)

[trading a future problem for a faster](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m54s)

[development now conscious this decision](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m56s)

[we do it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h38m59s)

[right yeah abstractions are are really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m01s)

[to help generalize things](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m04s)

[that's Sorry I'm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m07s)

[thinking I think I like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m10s)

[that and maybe my issue is it it's hard](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m18s)

[to get the ab the the the abstraction](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m21s)

[layer correct](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m25s)

[because you can you can definitely](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m28s)

[almost like a camera's field of view](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m31s)

[right you can be too close too far](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m32s)

[away and I think that's my what I see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m35s)

[often with the abstraction layers is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m39s)

[they they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m41s)

[get they're they're hard to get right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m42s)

[when when I uh teach at the university I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m46s)

[love love love when I get the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m48s)

[opportunity to teach the the section on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m51s)

[interfaces i love it because students](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m53s)

[because these are generally like third](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m57s)

[and fourth year university students](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h39m58s)

[they've been through a bunch of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m00s)

[programming classes you know they they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m01s)

[finally get to our class and it's like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m04s)

[okay they usually get warned that we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m06s)

[the final boss or something and so we we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m08s)

[we put them through the ringer uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m10s)

[because we want them to know what real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m12s)

[software dev feels like but I love](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m13s)

[asking them the question of you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m16s)

[what is an interface and because like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m18s)

[most of the class there's a there's the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m21s)

[handful of people who are willing who](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m22s)

[just don't like talking in class so they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m24s)

[won't interact at all and you have to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m26s)

[like it's like pulling teeth to get them](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m27s)

[to talk but then there's the people who](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m29s)

[are willing to talk and they and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m31s)

[typically what happens is people get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m33s)

[real nervous because they're like the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m35s)

[question seems too easy and and part of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m37s)

[it is is I'm looking for people to give](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m40s)

[me the book answer of an interface right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m42s)

[like give me the academic answer and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m45s)

[then the question is when do you use one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m47s)

[and and honestly some of them will get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m51s)

[to kind of the answer that you you have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m53s)

[there Izzy of effectively](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m55s)

[um they'll they'll get down to the idea](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h40m58s)

[of okay it's when I have a common set of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m02s)

[APIs or something of that nature is is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m04s)

[will be the answer that we get and and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m07s)

[then usually I start asking people what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m10s)

[a leaky abstraction is or similar and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m11s)

[that's usually where their knowledge](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m13s)

[breaks down um so it's it's it's very](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m14s)

[it's very](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m18s)

[interesting and yes Izzy you will see me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m20s)

[next week um I am around uh all the way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m22s)

[up until the uh the build conference so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m25s)

[it'll be the week of uh let's see the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m29s)

[22nd i may end up skipping um I suspect](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m32s)

[I will be driving that day because the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m36s)

[build conference doesn't get over until](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m38s)

[like I think 1 or 2:00 p.m and then I've](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m40s)

[got like a five or six hour drive so in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m44s)

[theory if I like jump in my car and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m46s)

[blitz I can make it back for regular](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m48s)

[streaming time but I'm probably going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m50s)

[be dead by that point so there the 22nd](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m52s)

[is probably canled so here for the next](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h41m55s)

[need my terminal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m24s)

[back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m26s)

[terminal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m28s)

[what why is that not finding my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m30s)

[terminal feel like an idiot in this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m33s)

[app why there we go because you need to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m37s)

[uh PowerShell is fine thanks that's all](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m43s)

[I need okay uh npm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m47s)

[uh open](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m53s)

[API](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h42m57s)

[oh thank you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m00s)

[okay and now we should](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m11s)

[have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m13s)

[updated files with all of the stuff and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m15s)

[specifically that payment details](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m19s)

[bits because that's what we're going](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m22s)

[for uh let's see release asset type](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m24s)

[changed up a little](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m28s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m31s)

[um this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m32s)

[brought in MSI deployment tool which is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m35s)

[kind of disappointing because we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m37s)

[about to whack it so you know there's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m38s)

[that um but this is just the updated](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m41s)

[schema so we're going to go with this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m45s)

[updating](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m48s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m52s)

[schema and commit changes and send that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m55s)

[as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h43m59s)

[well and then that should go out and go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m00s)

[live and then I think I can go back and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m02s)

[start hammering on a little bit of this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m05s)

[stuff and that will get us all the way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m08s)

[there so payment details are fixed got](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m11s)

[to go check my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m16s)

[notepad what was what else](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m18s)

[was I made myself a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m21s)

[list see we did the page we added the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m27s)

[enterprise](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m32s)

[card](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m39s)

[we think that handles all of the stuff](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m41s)

[that I was hoping to get to tonight this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m43s)

[is unusual i actually finish on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m45s)

[time this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m47s)

[exhilarating okay well let's go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m50s)

[app.ipac.io let's go take a look at it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m54s)

[and see it just work](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h44m58s)

[i do want to figure out why this thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m02s)

[is so bloody](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m03s)

[slow because it feels it feels slow i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m08s)

[don't like how long that is okay my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m12s)

[team's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m16s)

[billing okay so this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m20s)

[better um I think I just need to change](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m24s)

[these things up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m27s)

[see uh the ZAML design view stopped](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m30s)

[working after DI because it needs a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m33s)

[parameter list constructor it's okay i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m35s)

[guess I can run the app and see user](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m37s)

[controls are now a pain i have to add](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m39s)

[them through code behind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m41s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m43s)

[so hang on i got I got something for you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m45s)

[i got something for you um there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m49s)

[is so real quick maybe I should ask this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m56s)

[question is this WPF or is this Avalonia](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h45m58s)

[Uno Maui what's the framework of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m02s)

[choice i pro I pro probably got](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m06s)

[something for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m09s)

[you so and actually here I'll just drop](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m11s)

[I'll drop this link in the chat wpf](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m15s)

[perfect so let me show](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m18s)

[you let me show you this guy here real](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m21s)

[quick um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m24s)

[uh actually give me a new window i don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m28s)

[I think that one will die with Visual](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m29s)

[Studio so make their](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m31s)

[WPF example](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m34s)

[uh there net new](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m42s)

[WPF okay and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m49s)

[then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m52s)

[floor so that repo I just linked has](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m54s)

[some net uh new templates uh for example](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h46m57s)

[if you want to run this command on your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m01s)

[terminal you can have the templates as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m03s)

[well but if you create a WPF app with my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m05s)

[template so this is the way I enjoy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m10s)

[setting up my WPF apps and I've started](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m12s)

[doing this on a handful of ones is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m16s)

[there's just some boilerplate and and I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m18s)

[may expand this further because I've got](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m20s)

[I've got a couple apps that I've done](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m23s)

[this on and I try to keep track of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m24s)

[stuff that I tend to redo multiple times](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m26s)

[but there's a few extra things like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m28s)

[telemetry and similar that's like maybe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m29s)

[I should add in some more logging or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m31s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m33s)

[so this gives you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m35s)

[um something of of this nature right um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m40s)

[and I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m45s)

[believe trying to remember if the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m47s)

[designer played nice on this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m49s)

[one uh let me compile](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m51s)

[it and you're not wrong about the uh the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h47m55s)

[user controls but I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m00s)

[can can explain that here in just a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m02s)

[second and then I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m05s)

[think yeah so so you should be able to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m09s)

[get a working designer here right even](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m12s)

[without](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m15s)

[a default](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m17s)

[constructor right so this should get you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m19s)

[something that is reasonable but I will](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m23s)

[say the designer WPF has been](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m26s)

[notoriously uh finicky throughout the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m28s)

[years uh but this will get something set](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m31s)

[up it does uh go through and sets up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m34s)

[full DI generic host builder all the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m37s)

[things uh MVVM toolkit material design](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m41s)

[kind of the bare bones of the stuff that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m45s)

[I like to kind of have built in and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m47s)

[ready to go um see if I can find](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m50s)

[uh there was a proposal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h48m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m00s)

[MVBM toolkit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m01s)

[GitHub uh this one there was a proposal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m05s)

[out here from one of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m08s)

[other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m10s)

[maintainers of the material design one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m13s)

[um let me see if I can find it by author](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m16s)

[uh it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m27s)

[closed oh why am I not seeing it it was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m32s)

[it an issue all right I'm going to grab](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m37s)

[Nikolai's GitHub](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m41s)

[handle um because there was an issue out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m44s)

[here i thought it was an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m49s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m53s)

[open](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m55s)

[yeah so this one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m56s)

[here this was a proposal that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h49m59s)

[um Nikolai had put together based upon](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m03s)

[some stuff that I had done with generic](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m06s)

[host and dependency injection and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m08s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m10s)

[um as a way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m13s)

[of doing user controls and the proposal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m15s)

[here is a way of effectively having um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m19s)

[source generators build this this kind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m23s)

[of thing out for you to be able to do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m26s)

[the the user controls because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m28s)

[occasionally you do want something like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m30s)

[a an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m32s)

[iMer like in a lot of cases we can cheat](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m35s)

[and say well I'm going to push that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m37s)

[stuff into my view model and that's a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m39s)

[little less of a thing but this will get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m41s)

[you where you can do something more akin](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m44s)

[to this right because this is what you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m47s)

[want to write in your ZAML is you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m49s)

[namespace my user control and call it a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m52s)

[day so this does give you kind of a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h50m54s)

[um a link and I'll I'll send you his](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m00s)

[um send you Nikolai's example repository](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m05s)

[of how of how he set it up to be able to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m09s)

[go through and do it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m11s)

[which right like it is it you it's built](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m13s)

[around that same idea and gives a nice](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m16s)

[way of of kind of getting the user](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m19s)

[controls in um to have it work so it is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m21s)

[a little disappointing uh this is one of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m25s)

[those areas where WPF shows its age](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m28s)

[because it came out in uh 2005 and so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m30s)

[like generic host and a lot of this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m34s)

[stuff that like that none of that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m36s)

[existed when this was built](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m38s)

[so in some ways we're shoehorning in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m41s)

[something that uh is new into something](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m43s)

[old but it like it's doable](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m46s)

[uh let's see is design time creatable](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m49s)

[property in can't be set to true after](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m52s)

[DI uh is this usually a problem for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m54s)

[people or not uh not usually so is is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h51m57s)

[design time created or creatable is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m01s)

[generally something that is behind so uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m04s)

[this guy here right so because this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m09s)

[behind the the D namespace which is uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m12s)

[there for design uh an old tool used to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m16s)

[be called expression blend which is why](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m20s)

[this namespace still kind of pokes its](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m21s)

[head up every now and then uh this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m23s)

[something that is only expected to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m26s)

[consumed by a designer so it's not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m28s)

[actually something that's expected to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m31s)

[affect the app at runtime which is why](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m32s)

[you see this MC ignore namespace D so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m34s)

[it's specifically telling the the ZAML](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m38s)

[compiler hey this is something you don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m40s)

[touch right like we don't need this this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m42s)

[is just here for designers hands off um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m45s)

[the is design time creatable just tells](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m48s)

[the designer hey when you're looking to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m51s)

[populate your design](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m53s)

[surface use the metadata of this type](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m55s)

[but don't try to call its constructor](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h52m58s)

[right so is design time creatable false](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m01s)

[is really just to say hey this this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m03s)

[thing doesn't have a constructor that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m06s)

[you can call hands off use the metadata](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m08s)

[right you can get the type of the view](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m11s)

[model make sure that you validate like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m12s)

[the binding paths and those types of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m14s)

[things so that the designer can clearly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m16s)

[show you if you've typoed something](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m19s)

[right because if I do something like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m20s)

[that I now get the little bars because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m23s)

[it says hey hang on I don't find that in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m25s)

[this type right it hasn't instantiated](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m27s)

[the type but it still can look at the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m30s)

[type and say I know what properties you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m32s)

[pull that kind of thing off so generally](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m34s)

[it's not a huge issue for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m37s)

[people um but in like the setup for my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m39s)

[template you will see that it it it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m42s)

[intentionally sets it this way because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m45s)

[my things aren't likely to have default](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m48s)

[constructors in most cases like it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m50s)

[kind of unusual to have a data context](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m52s)

[that has a default constructor unless](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m55s)

[it's like a a Poco and I'm inside of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m57s)

[like a data template or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h53m59s)

[similar so if that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m02s)

[helps yeah are you trying to set it at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m09s)

[in like the the code behind or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m13s)

[similar um it it's a little unusual to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m15s)

[need access to this like design time](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m19s)

[data context from code behind because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m22s)

[it's it really is only there to support](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m25s)

[the designer really like you can whack](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m27s)

[all of this stuff and like aside from](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m30s)

[screwing up your designer it's not going](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m33s)

[to make a difference at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m36s)

[all because the other thing that you can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m41s)

[do right is you can come down here like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m44s)

[on this this click me button you can do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m46s)

[something like D colon](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m49s)

[content which is kind of a fun](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m52s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m55s)

[chris welcome and thank you for bringing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m56s)

[friends you are awesome i'm on a detour](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h54m59s)

[at the moment we're we're we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m02s)

[answering some WPF](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m03s)

[questions hopefully you had a good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m06s)

[stream i was secretly lurking in your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m08s)

[chat earlier when you were uh well you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m11s)

[had been talking about Salesforce and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m14s)

[soal and ADAC and all kinds of stuff and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m16s)

[it was giving me it was giving me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m20s)

[flashbacks to prior prior uh jobs and I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m22s)

[was like I refuse to admit that I've](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m25s)

[done Salesforce stuff it was not a good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m28s)

[experience i did not like it did not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m31s)

[like it it was horrible yeah exactly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m34s)

[uh yeah designer used to show me data](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m37s)

[too because my view model constructors](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m40s)

[were parameters now they now they aren't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m41s)

[that's so that that is interesting like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m43s)

[it it would show you so your designer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m46s)

[will show you data because if you don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m50s)

[have is design time like if this guy is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m52s)

[true the designer is actually invoking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m55s)

[your constructor and then if your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h55m57s)

[properties actually have data in them](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m00s)

[like your constructor sets a bunch of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m02s)

[stuff this is certainly possible the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m04s)

[other thing that you can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m07s)

[do inside of here is you can actually go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m09s)

[for the uh what what is the what is the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m13s)

[API for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m16s)

[this uh now you're going to make me try](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m18s)

[to think of this off the top of my head](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m21s)

[um you can actually get yourself a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m23s)

[uh an extra an overloaded constructor so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m27s)

[let's imagine we do something of this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m30s)

[nature right where we have like I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m32s)

[messenger right so something of of that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m35s)

[nature uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m38s)

[if what is it uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m41s)

[is I don't that magical](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m46s)

[Googles WPF check is design time in code](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m50s)

[behind I don't remember what the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m56s)

[designer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h56m59s)

[properties that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m01s)

[not that's not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m04s)

[Uh no that requires a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m08s)

[DI](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m12s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m14s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m16s)

[nope nope where is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m18s)

[the There is a property you can access](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m21s)

[that is static an on a static](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m24s)

[class that has all of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m27s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m30s)

[uh what is it called i just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m33s)

[I Yeah what is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m42s)

[it no there is a Is it on the base](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h57m51s)

[already no where Where is this there is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m00s)

[there is a it is not this there is a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m05s)

[static](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m08s)

[property that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m13s)

[is that is hanging out in there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m16s)

[and yeah this is getting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m26s)

[uh uh Mr](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m30s)

[designer properties is in design mode](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m32s)

[yeah that's what I'm finding but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m34s)

[I maybe I'm blanking on this there was](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m36s)

[the the problem with it is it requires a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m40s)

[dependency object to be fed in to know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m42s)

[if you're in in design mode and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m46s)

[I am I am I making this up is it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m47s)

[here there is a a static there there is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h58m55s)

[a static property for checking of it but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m00s)

[effectively one of the workarounds that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m02s)

[I've done before is you can set up your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m04s)

[default constructor to check if it's in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m06s)

[design mode if it's in design mode](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m09s)

[populate it with whatever kind of uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m11s)

[fake data you want to play with um and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m14s)

[if you're not in design mode just throw](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m17s)

[because the the dirty secret is if you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m20s)

[register this in the DI container the DI](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m23s)

[container is Gree it will evaluate your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m25s)

[constructors from most parameters to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m28s)

[least parameters and so it's going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m31s)

[try to go after this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m33s)

[constructor so the DI container is never](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m35s)

[going to try to hit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m38s)

[this and so you kind of leave your your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m39s)

[default constructor there for your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m42s)

[designer and let the the DI container go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m44s)

[after the overloaded](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m48s)

[constructor which makes it a little bit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m49s)

[nicer for what it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m52s)

[worth right so that that that gets you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m55s)

[all the way into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=01h59m58s)

[there um that's going to bother me now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m02s)

[that I don't have this so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m06s)

[make a note for myself because I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m07s)

[go find](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m09s)

[that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m11s)

[um then more importantly I may go add it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m15s)

[to my template just so that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m17s)

[um uh can you pass application current](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m20s)

[uh application current I don't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m25s)

[think derives from](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m29s)

[um from dependency object but we'll look](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m34s)

[in a second but you can you could](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m36s)

[certainly do main current main window](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m38s)

[because your main window will be um I oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m40s)

[application is a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m44s)

[uh dispatcher no it is not a dependency](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m46s)

[object so application no but you can go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m51s)

[application current main window and get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m54s)

[yourself](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m56s)

[there the only thing to watch out for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m57s)

[there is that main window is null before](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h00m59s)

[your main window is shown so you just if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m02s)

[you're doing it inside of like your app](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m05s)

[um your app.zaml or something you people](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m08s)

[often forget that that this can return](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m12s)

[null before app.run is called and this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m15s)

[returns null before your first window is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m17s)

[shown so it's they they both can return](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m19s)

[null but most of the time once](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m22s)

[somebody's app is actually started yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m24s)

[they're set and fixed and you're good to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m26s)

[go yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m31s)

[okay okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m34s)

[here added addit is in design mode got](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m37s)

[that enterprise](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m42s)

[card that is going to bother me i'm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m45s)

[going to have to go through and check](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m47s)

[that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m48s)

[now it's going to bother me a great deal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m49s)

[okay i wanted to check these guys here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m53s)

[of why cuz in this case where there is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m56s)

[none it's probably worth hiding it uh is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h01m59s)

[one instance of weak reference manager](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m04s)

[enough for the entire app i don't see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m05s)

[any slowdowns yeah yeah in general](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m07s)

[you're going to have um only a single](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m09s)

[instance of one of the messengers](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m12s)

[because they operate on a pub submodel](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m14s)

[and so it's kind of rare to need more](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m16s)

[than one instance um and the weak](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m20s)

[reference is generally the one you want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m22s)

[to go with because it won't accidentally](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m25s)

[keep things](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m27s)

[alive uh Chad GPT says you can pass in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m28s)

[new dependency object that's probably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m31s)

[true](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m33s)

[um yeah and you'll get away with it as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m36s)

[long as it's in a constructor that's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m39s)

[only invoked by the designer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m41s)

[um you will get an an interesting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m44s)

[exception and this is where it kind of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m47s)

[gets weird because new dependency object](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m49s)

[non UI thread because dependency object](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m54s)

[is the root of all base UI objects and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h02m57s)

[so it wants an STA thread a UI thread so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m01s)

[it it's rare that that ever comes up to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m05s)

[bite you but if people just kind of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m07s)

[blindly do that pattern inside of say a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m10s)

[C object that they're going to use as a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m13s)

[view model in say a list and they're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m15s)

[doing it in an asynchronous call or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m17s)

[similar it can then bite them on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m20s)

[accident you get into this weird](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m22s)

[situation where it's like well it should](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m24s)

[throw if it's not in design mode it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m26s)

[like well but you're actually throwing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m28s)

[on the parameter that you're passing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m29s)

[into the method to check if you're in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m31s)

[design mode so you never get to the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m32s)

[actual throw that you want you get some](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m34s)

[sort of cross thread exception](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m36s)

[instead yeah okay so I think I want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m40s)

[change this guy up because when this guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m43s)

[now is coming back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m46s)

[my There you are there you are refresh i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m50s)

[want to just look at this because this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m53s)

[guy here should come back now with one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m55s)

[of these things there's the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h03m59s)

[payments yeah so he's coming back with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m01s)

[effectively empty](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m05s)

[because this is a custom one yeah you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m06s)

[can first check if you're an SDA thread](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m10s)

[no that is true and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m11s)

[that's You're going to make me go look](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m14s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m16s)

[um actually you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m21s)

[what one second we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m24s)

[because I need to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m28s)

[open need to open something that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m29s)

[not not open source let me look because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m33s)

[I I am very confident I have used this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m37s)

[property on another project so I just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m39s)

[need to look at it real quick](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m42s)

[i I distinctly remember there being one](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m46s)

[and because I got into a debate with a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m51s)

[colleague about it at one point and I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m53s)

[was proven the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m56s)

[fool and so I I it's remarkable about](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h04m58s)

[how often when you make a when your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m02s)

[colleague proves that you're the idiot](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m05s)

[um how much that actually is a good](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m07s)

[learning opportunity and then it's stuck](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m09s)

[in your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m10s)

[head uh okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m11s)

[so let me look where are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m16s)

[you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m22s)

[oh oh did we implement it ourselves oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m31s)

[we may have implemented](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m36s)

[ourselves sorry looking](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m40s)

[This may be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m43s)

[something look at that we implemented](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m51s)

[ourselves that's why I was convinced](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m56s)

[there was a static](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h05m58s)

[property](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m00s)

[huh yeah uh one second let](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m02s)

[me let me go pull the APIs because I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m07s)

[can't show that project but I can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m11s)

[certainly](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m13s)

[show a different](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m15s)

[one that is open](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m17s)

[source](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m21s)

[so that that is why okay so so we did we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m26s)

[did something we did something bad and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m31s)

[horrible and I'm both impressed and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m33s)

[terrified all at the same time uh sorry](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m36s)

[one second i just got to set this up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m51s)

[that I might need to might need to add](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m54s)

[something like this to my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m57s)

[templates](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h06m59s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m01s)

[uh then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m03s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m09s)

[because it yeah it is ending up going](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m21s)

[through that a very similar](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m23s)

[um API](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m26s)

[call but there was one last kind of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m29s)

[cheap trick that got abused](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m33s)

[and okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m54s)

[so so the let's see I will go here okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h07m58s)

[so here is effectively](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m02s)

[what my other project had done is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m06s)

[something is something very akin to this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m10s)

[so there's your static property is in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m11s)

[design mode which is why I was convinced](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m13s)

[it existed but and um the actual](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m15s)

[implementation here is still going after](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m20s)

[that same uh dependency property but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m23s)

[rather than needing to new up a new](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m26s)

[dependency object and potentially hit](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m29s)

[your c the the threading issues it goes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m31s)

[it pulls the property descriptor for it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m35s)

[and grabs the default value because the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m38s)

[default value will flip to true or false](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m42s)

[depending on whether you're in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m44s)

[designer or not so it saves you on the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m46s)

[instantiation of a dependency object for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m49s)

[a worthless boolean](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m51s)

[check and then frankly we probably could](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m53s)

[have gone a step further and I mean I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m56s)

[guess this is only ever going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m58s)

[evaluate once because it's a getter and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h08m59s)

[then it's cached so it it ends up doing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m01s)

[that the other thing you'll note is the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m05s)

[namespace is kind of wacky um and this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m07s)

[gets even even more fun right because in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m11s)

[our other project we effectively have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m14s)

[something akin to the following](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m18s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m21s)

[see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m22s)

[using include](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m24s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m27s)

[uh static true so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m30s)

[now due to the virtues of magic I can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m34s)

[come over here and I can go if is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m39s)

[in design](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m44s)

[mode unless I'm an idiot uh oh uh my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m46s)

[static](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m50s)

[needs this on the end of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h09m52s)

[it and then this magically](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m00s)

[resolves yeah that was the second](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m04s)

[suggestion of Chad GBT see the AI is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m06s)

[slowly learning slowly learning but yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m08s)

[so the the dirty trick and I can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m12s)

[translate this back into C is my other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m15s)

[project did this in and not even in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m17s)

[CS project this is in a directory build](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m20s)

[props so it applies to all the projects](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m22s)

[which is even more exciting right but if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m25s)

[you do a using static right so if I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m28s)

[comment this out right I can go show it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m31s)

[in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m34s)

[C right so if you do a using static it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m35s)

[now means all static members of this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m40s)

[class are available in here as though](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m42s)

[this thing was referenced so now this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m45s)

[thing just magically shows up which is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m48s)

[why I was convinced it was on my view](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m50s)

[model base or something similar right it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m52s)

[just No no it's It's because we did this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m55s)

[and we made it look we made it look like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h10m57s)

[it was part of our view model base by](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m00s)

[not making it look like it was part of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m02s)

[our view model base and then I confused](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m03s)

[myself so but I may I may need to go and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m06s)

[add this in because this is a reasonably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m08s)

[useful thing to have access to and at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m12s)

[least in my net templates I don't mind](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m15s)

[adding this kind of thing i try to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m18s)

[balance how much because at the end of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m20s)

[the day if you don't like it just delete](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m22s)

[the file you're done but in the cases](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m23s)

[where you need it it can be really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m26s)

[helpful because then you don't have to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m30s)

[go look this look this stuff](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m32s)

[up that would potentially make a lot of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m37s)

[sense because it would give it would](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m40s)

[give the uh because then I could](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m41s)

[actually I guess update my my sample](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m42s)

[rather than is design time creatable](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m45s)

[false i could make this true and then](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m49s)

[actually show those two things there as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m52s)

[well right that was the other thing I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m55s)

[was going to show down here too right is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h11m58s)

[this thing has like if I do D colon](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m00s)

[content right right you'll see it shows](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m04s)

[click](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m06s)

[me uh but if I do uh just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m07s)

[content foo right so in my designer it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m11s)

[going to show click me but when I launch](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m14s)

[this it's actually going to show foo](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m16s)

[because you can actually do design time](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m17s)

[data on anything so you can do it as a a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m20s)

[data source you can do design time](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m24s)

[properties it's just a way of saying I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m26s)

[want to look at this in the designer we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m28s)

[often abuse this to test like you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m30s)

[string wrapping or similar right so the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m33s)

[app launches and my app button is now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m35s)

[foo rather than it being something](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m37s)

[slightly more](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m40s)

[interesting right so it it comes in and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m41s)

[goes "Oh okay great." But when I'm in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m44s)

[the designer I want the designer to show](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m46s)

[click me instead right so cheap tricks](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m49s)

[there just to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m53s)

[i honestly I tend to only use the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m55s)

[designer in very limited circumstances i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h12m58s)

[really I really don't like it that much](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m02s)

[i um only because the designer shows](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m05s)

[what might be at runtime and I'd rather](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m08s)

[just launch the app and see what is um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m11s)

[it it does mean that you know you have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m14s)

[to rely on hot reload and the hot mess](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m16s)

[that that can be at times but it it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m18s)

[works it works a solid 60 to 70% of the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m21s)

[time and then you restart your app and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m24s)

[so it's like h I kind of like that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m27s)

[better because then I'm seeing the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m30s)

[actual running app but there are times](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m32s)

[where the the feedback loop and this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m35s)

[where webdev does have an advantage over](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m38s)

[Windows devs is the feedback loop on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m41s)

[webdev is so bloody fast it's like oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m45s)

[I'm going to change this there it is and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m48s)

[it's just going um that's the promise of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m49s)

[hot reload is to make Windows dev as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m53s)

[good as that uh it just has not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m55s)

[delivered it's better than nothing and I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h13m56s)

[would be very unhappy if they took it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m00s)

[speaking of web development look billing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m10s)

[information yay billing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m13s)

[information so I think though payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m16s)

[method and next payment we should](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m19s)

[probably just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m21s)

[hide like this thing here i think we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m24s)

[hide if next bill amount is null and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m27s)

[payment method i think we hide if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h14m32s)

[is in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m12s)

[here right i think is where I'm at oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m16s)

[looking at the running app not the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m22s)

[There's local](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m24s)

[host](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m26s)

[uh that is acting like my API is down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m29s)

[let's just relaunch that before I do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m33s)

[something stupid like break](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m35s)

[it oh uh and my local host is broken](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m37s)

[because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m41s)

[uh it is pointed](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m43s)

[at prod this will redirect it back](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m46s)

[yeah at some point I need to clean this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m53s)

[up but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m54s)

[I prefer to run all local and very](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h15m56s)

[rarely whereas my partner likes to run](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m02s)

[the front end and just point it at the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m03s)

[the dev environment so that he doesn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m06s)

[have to stand up any infrastructure](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m08s)

[one I really wish there was a better way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m14s)

[team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m35s)

[billing right and I think what would be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m36s)

[ideal is if I had set myself up in a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m39s)

[similar state as the other one so that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m43s)

[am on a custom plan i think we can do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m46s)

[this easily enough i think I have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m49s)

[um a database connection](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m53s)

[already set to go i think I think I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h16m57s)

[think I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m01s)

[think if not we'll go and steal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m02s)

[it because that is one of the other nice](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m06s)

[parts](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m09s)

[about net Aspire is we can um come into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m10s)

[like the API and we can where is the if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m15s)

[we come down here we will find the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m19s)

[connection string for our](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m22s)

[database don't no one panic this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m24s)

[launch](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m37s)

[or at least every time I recycle my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m38s)

[database so if we need to There's my](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m41s)

[connection string uh okay i don't know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m43s)

[what that is connecting to because it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m46s)

[clearly lost its mind uh let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m48s)

[connect to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m51s)

[database uh SQL server i think we can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m53s)

[go localhost and then authentication SQL](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h17m56s)

[server username SA password is insert](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m01s)

[connection string password here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m05s)

[uh let's see here and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m11s)

[then probably need to feed it the right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m14s)

[port because I imagine it is going to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m17s)

[lost and confused without](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m20s)

[that and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m25s)

[then mandatory true select database](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m27s)

[name test connection i guess let's start](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m34s)

[there make sure it can actually get](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m36s)

[itself all the way](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m38s)

[in anything else over here that I need](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h18m41s)

[to switch this back i wonder if local](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m12s)

[host is just failing to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m14s)

[resolve it's interesting that there's a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m19s)

[comma there i don't recall seeing that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m21s)

[but that must be uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m23s)

[Uh the certificate issue is by an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m33s)

[authority that is not trusted trust](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m36s)

[suffering uh let's see here so I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h19m57s)

[want this guy show table data i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m01s)

[believe there is that and then I would](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m08s)

[like to set it to a custom plan](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m11s)

[um so that I can do so I could be in the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m15s)

[same state as my other one if we go here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m17s)

[and we go with subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m20s)

[plan I need the magical grid for custom](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m24s)

[which as you can see is very cleverly 42](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m27s)

[billing and I go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m42s)

[refresh did it not commit the change](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m46s)

[uh add database windows like thing but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m54s)

[success pop-up triggered is dark again](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m56s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h20m59s)

[yeah this uh this UI section of Visual](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m00s)

[Studio has not received as much love as](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m04s)

[others it is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m07s)

[with Windows](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m28s)

[inconsistency you're not wrong you're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m30s)

[not wrong okay there we go okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m33s)

[wonderful okay so now we're in now we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m38s)

[in the same state locally that we're out](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m41s)

[that we are out in the environment and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m43s)

[now we fix right now we fix okay so we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m45s)

[are underneath uh team billing and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m49s)

[really what I want to do is just find](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m52s)

[that payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m53s)

[method](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m55s)

[um okay so this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h21m57s)

[is let's see teams billing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m01s)

[page okay okay so we have the payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m05s)

[status the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m07s)

[quotas and let's see monitor your](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m12s)

[current one what I'm really looking for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m18s)

[where Yeah payment next bill next bill](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m25s)

[amount](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m28s)

[this is where I kind of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m30s)

[expected it to plan details card i think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m33s)

[that's what we're looking at isn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m37s)

[it payment method next payment i think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m39s)

[that's right payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m42s)

[method next payment yeah and so the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m46s)

[issue here is I would like to turn these](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m49s)

[things off because it's good about](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m52s)

[handling payment card but I think I want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m54s)

[to actually bring this up a level](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m56s)

[i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h22m59s)

[think if payment card isn't set I think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m01s)

[I want to hide this whole](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m04s)

[chunk finally a stack i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m07s)

[understand well I will say uh React is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m10s)

[not my my dayto-day so if I seem like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m14s)

[I'm muddling my way through uh feel free](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m18s)

[to correct](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m20s)

[me because I am good enough to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m23s)

[dangerous](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m26s)

[um and that's about as far as I'm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m27s)

[willing to commit let's see so let's do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m29s)

[uh do payment card here because if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m35s)

[payment card is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m37s)

[null I think I think I want to hide the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m39s)

[entire box is the the game plan](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m47s)

[uh so I guess what we could just do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m52s)

[is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h23m57s)

[this we come down](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m00s)

[here right and then we just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m02s)

[do I think I probably still want the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m09s)

[empty box in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m12s)

[there and something something akin to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m13s)

[that interesting okay so let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m19s)

[here that Yes yes because in this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m23s)

[situation there that Yes i I think the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m27s)

[only thing I want to see is view past](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m31s)

[invoices i don't want any of the other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m33s)

[stuff and so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m35s)

[then for this one it's going to be the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m37s)

[same thing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m40s)

[if if next bill because I don't want to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m41s)

[get rid of the view past invoices link](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m44s)

[because that's actually useful to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m46s)

[um to people if they if they've like if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m50s)

[they've signed up for a subscription](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m55s)

[then canceled it then came back later](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m56s)

[signed up then cancelled it like I want](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h24m58s)

[them to still be able to get back and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m00s)

[view all of those older](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m01s)

[invoices but if you don't have a next](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m03s)

[bill coming that that means that Stripe](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m06s)

[doesn't think it needs to bill you next](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m10s)

[month which means you've probably](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m12s)

[cancelled i hope otherwise I don't know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m14s)

[how else to get into this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m17s)

[state and actually though I think this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m20s)

[gets down to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m23s)

[It is an interesting problem here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m32s)

[because this thing is dynamically](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m34s)

[loading payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m36s)

[card and then swapping this out once](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m38s)

[it's been loaded so now I've got an](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m41s)

[awkward problem in that I'm hiding the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m44s)

[whole thing now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m48s)

[i don't know if I like that experience](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m53s)

[because it's almost nicer to see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h25m56s)

[the because that that skeleton's this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m00s)

[guy right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m03s)

[here which it's nice to say hey you know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m05s)

[loading that kind of thing but now it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m08s)

[now it's weird because I've now](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m10s)

[effectively removed the use case for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m12s)

[this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m17s)

[trying to decide then what I expect to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m19s)

[see because this expects to be getting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m27s)

[back a payment card and when there is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m33s)

[none there's nothing to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m37s)

[show you know what we're going to hide](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m43s)

[it and I'm going to I'm going to ask](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m45s)

[Kaylin what he thinks he's got an eye](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m48s)

[for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m50s)

[UI i'll ask him for his feedback because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m51s)

[this it feels wrong to leave it sitting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m55s)

[like that but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h26m59s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m02s)

[um and actually wait a minute what's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m04s)

[being passed in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m06s)

[here maybe what we should do is we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m08s)

[should just have the skeleton](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m11s)

[returned when payment is null but if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m15s)

[payment payment card](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m18s)

[isn't that might be better that okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m20s)

[okay okay that makes me feel more warm](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m24s)

[and fuzzy so we're going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m27s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m30s)

[there come down to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m32s)

[here right and then that becomes here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m35s)

[and then something akin to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m39s)

[that and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m41s)

[then what have I done wrong uh let's see](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m47s)

[here payment payment](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m50s)

[uh one parent element](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h27m53s)

[oh because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m06s)

[I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m08s)

[right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m10s)

[right this guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m16s)

[here let's Let's go like this for just a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m22s)

[second um just to get that thing to stop](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m25s)

[yelling at me and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m29s)

[then but why does this thing not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m33s)

[realize that there is only a single](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m42s)

[parent](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m46s)

[uh surround](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m48s)

[with Oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m50s)

[right thank you i forgot about this so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m53s)

[it's that yeah oh no it's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h28m58s)

[inside](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m03s)

[inside that way because it w it wants](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m09s)

[only a single parent as the top level](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m13s)

[it's not referring to the parent outside](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m15s)

[of the turner it's referring to the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m17s)

[elements inside of it this entire](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m19s)

[expression can only have a single parent](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m21s)

[right right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m22s)

[right right right right okay thank you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m24s)

[thank you thank you thank you see like I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m27s)

[said I know this stack just well enough](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m29s)

[to be dangerous not well well enough to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m31s)

[be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m36s)

[um do I want an empty box](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m38s)

[here i don't know that I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m41s)

[do i don't know that I do okay so that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m44s)

[gets me to there](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m48s)

[so cuz I kind of like the idea](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h29m55s)

[of You're doing great turnary](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m00s)

[wizard i do so like I feel like I have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m03s)

[decent knowledge of C and so I will say](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m07s)

[I I get myself I get myself into the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m10s)

[most trouble when something feels CP and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m13s)

[I shouldn't do it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m16s)

[C# um and then I get then I get bit oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m17s)

[left and right um I think though what I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m20s)

[want I want to go through and I think I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m29s)

[want to pull these skeletons](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m32s)

[out like this is still valid](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m35s)

[here we know that next bill has to be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m41s)

[set in order to get into here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m45s)

[um and I don't think this skeleton is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m51s)

[actually going to make any sense at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h30m54s)

[all](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m01s)

[but wonder why these were different](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m03s)

[widths um but this guy here goes like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m06s)

[that because we only want to display](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m11s)

[this if we actually get a billing amount](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m13s)

[that makes sense to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m17s)

[me and then what I think I want to do is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m18s)

[I want to set the skeleton for the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m23s)

[little loading](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m27s)

[bar outside when there's no](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m28s)

[payment i think that's the the kicker](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m32s)

[right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m36s)

[so not](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m37s)

[payment something like that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m40s)

[uh that is not the right one bad](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m45s)

[co-pilot you and you you missed by a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m51s)

[mile and then I think this goes away](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h31m57s)

[because payment card has to be set so we](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m00s)

[always fall into the true case so this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m03s)

[else case goes away and we're just left](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m06s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m09s)

[think yeah that gets me to there that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m21s)

[goes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m24s)

[there i do wonder if there should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m29s)

[something else](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m31s)

[here feels like there should be](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m35s)

[something else](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m37s)

[here i don't know i don't know what to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m39s)

[put there though um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m41s)

[okay and then the view past](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m47s)

[invoices land details](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m51s)

[card that thing every everything floats](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m55s)

[to the top i guess](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h32m58s)

[uh if I recall correctly you can return](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m02s)

[null instead of an empty fragment uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m04s)

[let's see if there's nothing else just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m08s)

[do a double](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m10s)

[amperand oh I see yeah yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m13s)

[because we can do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m16s)

[the like this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m18s)

[yep you can get away with](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m22s)

[that ic so this is again a good example](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m27s)

[of because it's not CP i don't think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m31s)

[about this option](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m34s)

[because we definitely don't do this in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m39s)

[C# okay so but I think that cleans up](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m44s)

[the custom plan one and this is really](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m48s)

[one of those](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m50s)

[situations um yeah so you do you no I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m51s)

[this is part of me trying to learn what](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m56s)

[is I don't know customary because every](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h33m57s)

[language and framework there's like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m00s)

[these like there's a lot of things you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m02s)

[can do in C# and a lot of things you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m04s)

[just shouldn't right like there's the um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m06s)

[there's one guy from Microsoft who's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m09s)

[been putting together this I I think he](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m11s)

[calls it everyday C which is the normal](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m13s)

[way to do things right yeah you can do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m16s)

[whatever you want but it's like this is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m18s)

[what normal is so I I always try to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m20s)

[figure out what that normal is because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m22s)

[in one it helps plus if you're using](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m26s)

[co-pilot like the co-pilot likes you a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m29s)

[lot better if you write](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m32s)

[normal uh okay so we're going to we're](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m33s)

[going to send that uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m36s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m39s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m40s)

[see hiding](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m42s)

[uh empty elements when a user is on](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m46s)

[Move my big head to the other side oh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m53s)

[wait why am I doing this a co-pilot and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m56s)

[by co-pilot I mean](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h34m59s)

[Gemini improves building page loading](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m01s)

[experience enhances the building page by](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m04s)

[displaying](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m06s)

[skeletons uh yeah no uh thanks okay send](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m08s)

[it uh let's see just customary that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m16s)

[fragments are generally used if you do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m20s)

[not want a parent node but you need uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m23s)

[to next multiple nodes whereas if you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m26s)

[need an empty node or no node at all you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m28s)

[could just return null ah okay good to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m30s)

[know good to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m32s)

[know](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m36s)

[okay i think though that gets me into](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m37s)

[here that gets me](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m41s)

[past Can I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m45s)

[Create team i do](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m49s)

[this i don't know if I'm going to](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m52s)

[be It was successfully created great](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h35m57s)

[so that worked and it should block me if](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m04s)

[I try to do another team because you are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m08s)

[only allowed to be in one free team at a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m11s)

[time](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m13s)

[so let's just make](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m15s)

[sure why did it let that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m22s)

[through can I just keep abusing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m26s)

[this this feels like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m29s)

[a Why is that letting it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m32s)

[through okay now we got to go look](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m35s)

[because I I thought we had a rule around](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m37s)

[this list team bops create](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m42s)

[team oh it's not on the team i bet you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m54s)

[it's on the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h36m57s)

[project it's at the project level where](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m01s)

[it gets enforced let you Oh that's right](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m03s)

[we couldn't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m05s)

[enforce it at the project level we can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m08s)

[enforce the limitation on teams because](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m11s)

[a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m15s)

[team let me see let's see if I can](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m15s)

[explain this properly so inside of eleac](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m19s)

[flow a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m22s)

[team contains](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m24s)

[projects projects contain channels](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m26s)

[channels contain uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m30s)

[releases right and a release may have a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m33s)

[lot of different artifacts inside of it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m36s)

[and a channel could be like alpha beta](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m38s)

[prod or a channel could be like Windows](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m40s)

[Mac right it's just they are two](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m42s)

[separate streams of artifacts and for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m45s)

[whatever reason you need two separate](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m48s)

[streams of artifacts](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m50s)

[um but teams are where the billing uh uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m53s)

[billing subscription is linked to a team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h37m58s)

[and if we banned you from making](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m01s)

[infinite teams you would have no way of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m03s)

[if you wanted to say "Hey I want to make](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m06s)

[a new team and attach a billing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m09s)

[subscription to it you have to be able](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m11s)

[to make the team first and then attach](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m12s)

[the build to it." So we allow the team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m13s)

[to go through but we block the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m15s)

[number of projects that you can have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m18s)

[outside of it that's right okay yeah I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m20s)

[remember how this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m24s)

[worked right so I can create a project](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m28s)

[here right so this exists in team team](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m30s)

[or in team test if I go here and I go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m33s)

[here and I go projects and I go create](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m36s)

[projectu create project there we go](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m42s)

[so it is appropriately blocked it's just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m47s)

[at the project level you can only create](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m50s)

[uh projects i like the color scheme you](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m53s)

[went with this oh thank you i had no uh](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m55s)

[well I shouldn't say I had no design](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h38m58s)

[input my my partner actually did the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m00s)

[lion share of the um the front-end UI](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m04s)

[work so Kalin gets credit for that but](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m07s)

[yeah it is it is very nice and I will](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m11s)

[say like it wasn't like he did it in a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m13s)

[vacuum like there was there was a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m15s)

[designer that had some input and then he](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m16s)

[absolutely came to me for feedback and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m19s)

[whatnot but yeah he's he gets the the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m20s)

[credit for it and there's there's this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m24s)

[little I don't know if people have](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m26s)

[noticed the the it's animated up here](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m27s)

[it's just it's just it's just pretty it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m29s)

[kind of gives you that nice little](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m32s)

[running flowing feel like it it just](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m34s)

[feels](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m37s)

[nice so](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m38s)

[okay that makes me feel much better yeah](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m41s)

[it's it's one of those little things i](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m44s)

[think Kaylin messaged me when he did it](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m46s)

[and and I think his words were "I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m47s)

[promise I'm doing important stuff](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m49s)

[too." Which I was like "That's it's fine](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m51s)

[dude." Like it's I I understand we are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m54s)

[developers we get caught up in that in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h39m58s)

[those types of things like oo](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m00s)

[like and like this whole project like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m04s)

[we're trying we're building a product](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m06s)

[whose target audience is other](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m09s)

[developers and that's almost the most](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m12s)

[terrifying audience to build things](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m15s)

[for because they're likely to do weird](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m17s)

[crap they they have a very high bar and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m21s)

[they will complain about everything like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m24s)

[that is a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m26s)

[developer i would know because I'm like](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m27s)

[that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m29s)

[so that's that's kind of the way it goes](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m30s)

[um okay well the good news is I think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m33s)

[that that finishes my laundry list at](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m37s)

[least for](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m40s)

[tonight](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m42s)

[shift yeah Mountain Dew is empty so that](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m43s)

[that probably signals that that is a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m46s)

[good a good ending](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m49s)

[place i think so i think I think that is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m51s)

[probably a good spot uh okay so a few](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m56s)

[things for all the new people who jumped](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h40m59s)

[in um Microsoft Build is coming up um](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m00s)

[least sign it like the in-person tickets](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m16s)

[are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m18s)

[expensive um don't quote me i think](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m19s)

[they're like 2,200 something like they](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m21s)

[they aren't cheap](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m24s)

[um the I was say I guess we could look](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m26s)

[uh Well I guess they aren't they aren't](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m30s)

[as bad](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m32s)

[1,500 for the the in-person experience](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m33s)

[but the digital online one is free so I](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m36s)

[usually tell people it is worth signing](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m40s)

[up just so you get access to all of](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m42s)

[because nearly all of the sessions are](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m44s)

[going to be either livereamed or](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m46s)

[recorded and so it's worth getting](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m48s)

[access to all of those if there is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m50s)

[anything here that you are interested in](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m54s)

[for people unfamiliar Microsoft Build is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m55s)

[one of Microsoft's two big conferences](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h41m58s)

[that they do every year with the Build](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m00s)

[conference being slightly more developer](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m02s)

[focused the other one is Ignite which is](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m04s)

[slightly more IT focused but I mean](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m06s)

[those lights are blurry so you get a](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m08s)

[little bit of both at each um but this](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m10s)

[one tends to be a little bit more on the](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m13s)

[developer side um of the fence so and](https://youtu.be/REfKvVR6tvU?t=02h42m15s)
