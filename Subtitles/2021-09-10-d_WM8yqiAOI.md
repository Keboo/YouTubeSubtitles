[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m10s)

[back to my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m13s)

[combo box that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m15s)

[didn't quite get to finish last time due](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m16s)

[to finding all kinds of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m18s)

[fun problems and things to fight with so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m20s)

[i figured we would start there but a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m23s)

[couple things real quick by way of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m25s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m27s)

[uh i know i've i've plugged it before](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m28s)

[but i'm gonna plug it again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m31s)

[there are two upcoming dot-net user](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m33s)

[group talks uh for the spokane.net user](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m35s)

[group which is uh the one that um i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m37s)

[typically will attend me and my boss are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m41s)

[speaking on c-sharp noble reference](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m43s)

[types coming up next tuesday so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m45s)

[if you're watching this recorded on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m49s)

[youtube the youtube recording goes live](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m51s)

[on monday which means it's starting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m53s)

[tomorrow if you're watching this 48](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m54s)

[hours after i posted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m56s)

[there will be a recording](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h00m58s)

[um but if you are interested that one's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m00s)

[coming up and then i have one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m02s)

[in october uh the 12th](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m04s)

[going through uh fun features of c-sharp](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m07s)

[and horrendous ways to abuse them so my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m10s)

[plan is to go through i've written some](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m13s)

[absolutely horrible code that no one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m16s)

[should ever write](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m18s)

[uh basically trying to figure out how i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m19s)

[could take different c sharp features](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m21s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m22s)

[do things with them that they were never](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m23s)

[intended to do and so it'll be a lot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m25s)

[more light a little bit more fun but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m27s)

[hopefully a good example of learning](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m29s)

[different features of c sharp and sort](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m31s)

[of how those things work](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m33s)

[by looking at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m34s)

[arguably](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m36s)

[hopefully somewhat hilariously bad](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m37s)

[examples](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m39s)

[so there's that one there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m40s)

[next up hacktoberfest is coming](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m43s)

[20 days 5 hours 57 minutes and 16 15](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m46s)

[seconds](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m50s)

[so for those people unfamiliar with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m51s)

[hacktoberfest it is an event put on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m53s)

[every year by a company called](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m55s)

[digitalocean the aim is to get people](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m56s)

[active and involved working with open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h01m59s)

[source projects that doesn't necessarily](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m01s)

[even mean you have to write code either](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m03s)

[if you prefer to help people out a lot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m06s)

[of projects need help getting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m08s)

[documentation done and that kind of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m09s)

[thing so if that is something you would](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m11s)

[be interested in doing and helping out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m14s)

[with you do end up uh getting a shirt if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m16s)

[you get at least five of your pull](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m19s)

[requests accepted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m20s)

[worth noting your pull requests need to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m23s)

[be of actually providing value there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m25s)

[there are plenty of ways for maintainers](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m27s)

[to either flag things to spam or not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m29s)

[count](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m31s)

[so you are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m32s)

[the goal is to not submit five](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m33s)

[itty-bitty little prs and and just to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m35s)

[try to earn a shirt and they actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m38s)

[need to do something of consequence but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m39s)

[most maintainers even for uh or i should](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m41s)

[say especially for hacktoberfest will go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m44s)

[through and flag a bunch of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m47s)

[good first issues typically things that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m49s)

[are small really well defined simple](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m50s)

[things for people to pick up even](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m53s)

[without a lot of familiarity with the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m55s)

[repository so if you are interested](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h02m57s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m00s)

[definitely something i recommend](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m02s)

[especially if you are looking for a way](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m03s)

[to learn more about um source control](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m05s)

[git github that kind of thing i would](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m08s)

[encourage you to look for projects um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m10s)

[that you're interested in it obviously](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m13s)

[there is thousands of repositories that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m15s)

[will participate in this and the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m19s)

[material design project i'll show in a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m21s)

[little bit is definitely one of them](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m22s)

[but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m24s)

[beyond that find something that that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m25s)

[actually interests you you sure you can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m27s)

[poke around and find plenty of other](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m29s)

[ones but it's actually usually better to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m31s)

[get involved in something that you want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m33s)

[to see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m34s)

[maintain to move forward so i will i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m36s)

[will say that for october as well i plan](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m38s)

[on doing a lot of my streams revolving](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m41s)

[around git um github get cracking all of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m44s)

[kind of those related tools and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m47s)

[technologies so expect to see a lot of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m49s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m51s)

[come october](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m52s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m54s)

[so that said oh i don't need that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m56s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m57s)

[okay so we've got the combo box one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h03m58s)

[and this is where this is the branch](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m01s)

[that we left off on last time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m03s)

[and for those who who don't recall the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m05s)

[we have a combo box and it's kind of a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m09s)

[pain in the neck](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m11s)

[by kind of a pain in the neck i mean a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m14s)

[big pain in the neck](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m15s)

[so the material design look and feel for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m16s)

[what they call a drop down in wpf called](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m19s)

[a combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m22s)

[is we get this pop-up control and i'll](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m23s)

[show](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m26s)

[and i don't know exactly what state this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m27s)

[is going to be in so we're going to see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m28s)

[that close enough](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m31s)

[uh let's see so i would like to grab](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m32s)

[zoom it i need you on and i need carnac](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m35s)

[turned on sorry i was](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m38s)

[working right up until the start of this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m41s)

[stream and did not have an opportunity](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m42s)

[to get all my tools set up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m44s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m45s)

[there we go so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m47s)

[on the the combo box when you click on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m49s)

[it what ends up happening is it pops up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m55s)

[this kind of hover pop over the top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h04m56s)

[ooh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m00s)

[aro boris thank you for the sub](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m01s)

[i appreciate it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m03s)

[oh and thank you very much subscription](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m08s)

[with prime](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m10s)

[the the combo box when the drop down is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m12s)

[shown goes over the top here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m15s)

[with the the list of items](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m18s)

[but when you have a combo box that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m20s)

[editable which i think one of these guys](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m22s)

[here is yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m24s)

[this text box here is actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m26s)

[underneath](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m28s)

[um it it isn't even though it looks like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m29s)

[it's been lifted into the pop-up it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m32s)

[not what's actually happening is there's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m33s)

[we're cutting a hole out of the pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m35s)

[to look all the way through at the text](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m37s)

[box that's underneath](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m39s)

[not helpful and there's all kinds of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m41s)

[issues where this quickly starts to fall](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m44s)

[apart where the hole that we cut out in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m46s)

[the pop-up is not perfectly aligned over](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m48s)

[the top of the text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m51s)

[even when we do all of the math](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m53s)

[perfectly you still have to end up doing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m54s)

[a little bit of battle with the idea of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m57s)

[subpixel rendering there's a lot of bugs](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h05m59s)

[that have come up in the repository](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m01s)

[where if the background colors are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m03s)

[different and the sub pixel rendering](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m05s)

[isn't laid out just right you start to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m07s)

[see these little lines around the edge](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m09s)

[not a big deal but it's really obnoxious](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m11s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m15s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m16s)

[solution or at least the the latest bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m17s)

[of crazy that i'm gonna run down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m20s)

[um is to actually take that text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m22s)

[out of the visual tree of the combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m27s)

[slap it in the pop-up whenever the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m29s)

[pop-up is opened and then put it back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m31s)

[when the pop-up closes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m32s)

[that's what we're going to try](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m35s)

[because so far all the other ideas have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m36s)

[failed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m39s)

[and that one sort of worked](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m40s)

[didn't look great but it kind of worked](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m41s)

[so we're going to go for it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m45s)

[we're going to go for it that is going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m46s)

[to be the goal here and wow there are a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m48s)

[lot of binding errors here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m50s)

[hoy they hoy vey hoy veyhoy speaking of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m53s)

[hacktoberfest on that note um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h06m58s)

[i do plan on going through the material](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m02s)

[design project and there's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m03s)

[small issues like that with like binding](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m06s)

[failures and whatnot that i i try to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m08s)

[break apart into individual small issues](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m10s)

[and so if people are looking for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m13s)

[useful pr's to contribute that are small](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m16s)

[and easy and well defined](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m18s)

[keep an eye on the material design and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m20s)

[xaml project there will be stuff there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m21s)

[let me let me grab a link to the repo](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m25s)

[just in the event people are unfamiliar](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m27s)

[uh i think i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m30s)

[think i aliased it did i alias it i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m32s)

[think i did](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m35s)

[way that repositories effectively opt in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m49s)

[to hacktoberfest is by slapping these](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m52s)

[topics out on the repository so you can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m54s)

[see this one here i i need to double](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h07m58s)

[basic oktoberfest or if they want a year](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m02s)

[tacked onto it again we'll see there's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m04s)

[been a lot of issues around](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m06s)

[just trying to make sure that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m09s)

[um things are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m11s)

[easy for the maintainers um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m13s)

[hashicorp is or i should say a lot of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m16s)

[maintainers have been inundated with a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m18s)

[lot of spam prs and that's not good](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m19s)

[we're not we're not trying to we're not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m22s)

[trying to annoy the maintainers we're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m23s)

[trying to make it nicer for them](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m25s)

[the goal is to help not to enter](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m27s)

[okay so let's run down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m30s)

[let's run down that combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m33s)

[okay so if we look at last time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m37s)

[this combo box here was what we were](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m41s)

[going for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m44s)

[so inside of combo box template that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m46s)

[what we were building up so let's let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m48s)

[start there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m50s)

[combo](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m51s)

[box pop up boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m52s)

[grab that we'll grab the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m55s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h08m58s)

[xaml file](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m01s)

[which i think i just passed it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m03s)

[nope uh there's the assist hint proxy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m06s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m10s)

[i've just given up on that and i'm going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m11s)

[down here because this is a lot quicker](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m13s)

[okay and let me get this a little bigger](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m17s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m19s)

[as much as i like the xaml live preview](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m21s)

[go away go away](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m24s)

[uh for anybody who hasn't seen it um as](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m26s)

[well on the so i'm running visual studio](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m29s)

[2022 latest preview which i think is 3.1](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m32s)

[even if you're still on visual studio](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m38s)

[00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,240](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m40s)

something you should do tools options

[and then you come down here to preview](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m44s)

[features](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m46s)

[i love these things especially if you're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m47s)

[a little tolerant of things maybe not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m50s)

[always being perfect this is great stuff](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m56s)

[we're gonna turn that guy on as you can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h09m58s)

[see my default setting is coming here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m00s)

[and turn on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m02s)

[all the things](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m03s)

[um i don't know if i need this one i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m07s)

[don't have any repos i currently](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m09s)

[actively work on that span multiple](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m10s)

[repositories cool idea i don't that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m12s)

[would be for something that uses like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m15s)

[git submodules](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m17s)

[would probably be a common use case for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m18s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m20s)

[i would imagine but i love turning on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m22s)

[all these features key ones to turn on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m24s)

[though intellicode absolutely amazing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m26s)

[definitely turn it on um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m29s)

[out of process load and evaluation of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m32s)

[projects definitely turn on the speed at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m34s)

[which it loads is so much nicer](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m36s)

[the other key one specifically for wpf](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m39s)

[um is this xaml preview features and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m42s)

[mvvm productivity](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m45s)

[definitely love it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m47s)

[updated icons just because i think they](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m49s)

[look pretty](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m51s)

[and the new dark thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m54s)

[because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m56s)

[it's a new dark thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m57s)

[and you have to turn on new dark themes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h10m59s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m01s)

[combo box fun](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m03s)

[okay so we are focused specifically on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m06s)

[one situation with this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m08s)

[dark theme is life yes yes it is or at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m10s)

[least it's it's life for my eyes so it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m14s)

[not making them suffer a little bit more](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m17s)

[so the combobox template has](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m19s)

[different templates based upon the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m22s)

[direction of the pop-up we're not going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m24s)

[to deal with those we're going to get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m26s)

[this working for just down the normal](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m27s)

[use case](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m30s)

[and if it's not apparent i have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m33s)

[way too much mountain dew with me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m36s)

[tonight](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m40s)

[it's only a two liters worth of mountain](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m43s)

[dew](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m44s)

[i really want to fix this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m45s)

[okay so combo box pop-up this guy is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m47s)

[here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m50s)

[and we are passing through a couple](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m51s)

[things so specifically we added a couple](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m53s)

[properties to this popup so the combobox](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m56s)

[popup is our own custom control just to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h11m58s)

[be clear it derives from the default](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m01s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m03s)

[but we are passing through references](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m04s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m06s)

[the editable text box as well as the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m07s)

[original combo box i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m10s)

[remember exactly what the intent was](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m11s)

[here when we did so i believe the idea](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m14s)

[was](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m17s)

[down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m18s)

[uh where we override on opened or is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m21s)

[opened](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m24s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m29s)

[yeah so this is where we're going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m31s)

[so when we're opened we go hunting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m36s)

[why are we hunting this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m45s)

[cc what is cc used for oh this is just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m46s)

[finding the place where to go through](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m49s)

[and put it got it okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m50s)

[so on the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m52s)

[template of this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m54s)

[where's your template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h12m57s)

[my blind or stupid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m03s)

[placement target](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m04s)

[it was right up here above it wasn't it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m06s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m10s)

[content control yes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m12s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m16s)

[yeah this should have been going all the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m19s)

[way through](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m22s)

[so text box holder so this guy is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m23s)

[hunting for this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m25s)

[right so here's the down template for it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m31s)

[there's a content control](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m36s)

[and obviously we're dropping this whole](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m38s)

[mess because that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m40s)

[that's not what we're going to do so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m42s)

[when the pop-up is opened](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m44s)

[we go hunting in our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m46s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m48s)

[the control template inside of our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m49s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m51s)

[for this text box holder which we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m52s)

[probably need to do some sort of like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m53s)

[named part or similar so this is not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m55s)

[magic constant string](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m57s)

[but as long as we find it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h13m58s)

[and we've been given an edible text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m01s)

[and the parent of that text box is a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m05s)

[grid which we probably can get a little](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m07s)

[fancier](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m10s)

[i imagine this is ui element yeah we can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m12s)

[make this a panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m15s)

[we don't need to be specific](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m18s)

[panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m22s)

[that can go like that that can go like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m25s)

[that we remove it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m27s)

[from the parent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m29s)

[we cash our parent because we have to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m31s)

[able to put it back when we're done](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m32s)

[and then we set our content here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m34s)

[this guy here does the reverse once](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m37s)

[again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m39s)

[hunts this guy out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m41s)

[if parent is set and we have a text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m44s)

[we go ahead and put it back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m48s)

[simple straightforward](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m52s)

[for people who haven't seen this syntax](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m53s)

[before this is using the new c-sharp](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m55s)

[pattern matching](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m57s)

[double curly brace is a property-based](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h14m59s)

[pattern match and if you don't specify](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m02s)

[any properties like what we've done here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m04s)

[it will match any non-null value](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m06s)

[so is curly brace curly brace is just a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m09s)

[null check but the advantage here is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m11s)

[it's a null check into a local variable](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m13s)

[local variables are thread safe](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m16s)

[and can be inlined in nice expressions](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m19s)

[and whatnot so it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m21s)

[it's a boolean check and an assignment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m23s)

[combined into one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m25s)

[which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m27s)

[okay so that is good that is working](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m28s)

[let's see if we can get this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m32s)

[a little more](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m35s)

[robust](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m36s)

[so the one of the issues that came up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m39s)

[last time is when we lift that text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m42s)

[there's actually more than that text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m44s)

[that matters](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m46s)

[so specifically inside of this border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m49s)

[and and maybe we end up just needing to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m52s)

[lift more than the the text box itself](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m54s)

[i'm not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m57s)

[i'm not 100 certain so part of what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h15m58s)

[i think needs to be lifted up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m01s)

[is you've got the text box here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m03s)

[but sitting also inside the same column](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m08s)

[as this thing is something like the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m11s)

[smart hint control so when we saw that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m13s)

[kind of lightened text over the top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m15s)

[that's this guy here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m17s)

[suffix text block is the same thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m23s)

[i kind of want to do one more thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m30s)

[where i get a little fancier and do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m32s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m38s)

[foreground gets new](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m40s)

[just i just want to make sure that what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m47s)

[we're seeing is legit oh hang on is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m48s)

[legitimately](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m51s)

[fuchsia is the to do of the color world](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m52s)

[so we will use fuchsia](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m55s)

[okay and then we will just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h16m58s)

[uh know this guy back out and let it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m00s)

[inherit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m03s)

[okay i just want to make sure that what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m06s)

[we are seeing is in fact the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m08s)

[the real one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m12s)

[and that i'm not getting bit by](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m15s)

[something weird or fancy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m16s)

[come on compile you can do it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m21s)

[go go go go go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m24s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m26s)

[that is one feature i do intend to put](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m28s)

[in for hacktoberfest if somebody wants](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m30s)

[to write me a little feature where you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m32s)

[can pass a command line argument to have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m34s)

[this app start at a particular screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m35s)

[that would be really helpful](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m37s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m46s)

[so that's not quite right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m54s)

[and more importantly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h17m58s)

[it's interesting that i am getting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m07s)

[how am i getting this hint](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m11s)

[we didn't lift the hint we only lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m16s)

[the text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m18s)

[let's change the background rather than](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m29s)

[the foreground](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m31s)

[i'm wondering if the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m35s)

[did we leave a hole](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m40s)

[someone attempted to change the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m49s)

[background of the grid on the pop-up too](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m50s)

[just to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m52s)

[see combo boxes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h18m53s)

[yes something's not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m02s)

[something is not lining up the way](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m05s)

[one would expect i i i'm thinking the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m08s)

[the pull out and put back is probably](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m12s)

[what's making that hint disappear](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m14s)

[like this thing is getting um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m16s)

[i think what i want to do is rather than](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m25s)

[making that thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m28s)

[behave weird](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m29s)

[um i want to explicitly set the z order](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m33s)

[on this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m37s)

[z index gets](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m41s)

[zero i think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m45s)

[trying to look at who else might be in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m48s)

[this guy that should have higher](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m49s)

[see this is fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h19m58s)

[though maybe the solution okay hold on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m03s)

[let's think this through](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m06s)

[because these two we only ever use](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m08s)

[either the content presenter or the text](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m10s)

[box at any given time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m12s)

[i'm wondering if we should just move](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m16s)

[this grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m18s)

[because that picks up the text block for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m21s)

[the prefix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m23s)

[the editable text box the smart hint the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m25s)

[suffix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m27s)

[i'm thinking we grab the grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m38s)

[and i'm thinking this becomes a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m43s)

[ui element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m47s)

[and this becomes a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m50s)

[ui element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h20m58s)

[ui element we're going to leave it named](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m02s)

[funny for the moment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m04s)

[circle back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m06s)

[this is mostly just to see if we can get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m07s)

[it to work correctly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m09s)

[okay so hang on i need to do i keep](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m12s)

[losing my place so here's what we're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m14s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m16s)

[we are going to create a bookmark](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m17s)

[so the button here but it's also control](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m19s)

[kk](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m21s)

[and then we are going to go down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m23s)

[here to wherever the other one is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m26s)

[bookmarks are just lightweight](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m30s)

[markers inside of your](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m35s)

[inside of any of your text files that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m37s)

[you can then jump between so it's just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m38s)

[leave a little spot here make it easy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m41s)

[there's all there's a ton of setters](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m44s)

[there that's what i'm looking for combo](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m47s)

[box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m48s)

[and then we'll put this i don't know](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m51s)

[right on the combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m52s)

[so you can see the little icon on the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m54s)

[side that shows up here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m55s)

[that ultimately is what's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h21m59s)

[and then we can go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m01s)

[so for example we come back here and go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m05s)

[give me the inner root](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m07s)

[uh kn](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m09s)

[nope what was next bookmark](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m11s)

[ctrl k n](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m14s)

[i must have missed the key](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m16s)

[and then this is gonna be down here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m18s)

[we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m24s)

[and i think that's fine i think all we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m28s)

[have to do is change this up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m30s)

[because we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m36s)

[we're not going to worry about that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m38s)

[being a text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m40s)

[i'm not going to worry about that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m43s)

[yeah that clearly needs to be renamed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m50s)

[but the rest of it should be fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m52s)

[obviously we need to rename this thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h22m58s)

[all these text box things](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m00s)

[to be more like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m02s)

[i don't know](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m04s)

[combo box current item or something](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m06s)

[so i type](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m19s)

[it's like it's not lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m30s)

[so let's take a look at what's going on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m41s)

[good pal snoop come here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m43s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m47s)

[go what is in here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m48s)

[so we are looking for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m53s)

[wherever that guy lives](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m55s)

[scroll viewer that's the list of items](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h23m58s)

[no i need to be higher up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m01s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m04s)

[in a root there it is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m07s)

[so hold on why does inner root contain](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m21s)

[text box holder](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m24s)

[it does have prefix and what not set on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m26s)

[it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m29s)

[so it is lift](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m36s)

[i'm guessing i just got my wires crossed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m40s)

[somewhere because it's lifting some of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m42s)

[the stuff](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m44s)

[and there's obviously a placement](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m47s)

[problem that needs to be addressed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m49s)

[we'll deal with that in a minute just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m53s)

[because you see this thing move my goal](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m54s)

[is to make it move as little as possible](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m56s)

[there still may be a slight shift at the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h24m58s)

[end because of those](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m00s)

[pixel bits](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m01s)

[and the sub pixel rendering stuff](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m03s)

[but no one's going to notice if it moves](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m05s)

[half a pixel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m07s)

[it's really hard to see more importantly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m09s)

[that won't result in bugs being filed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m11s)

[against the repo which is really the end](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m13s)

[goal here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m15s)

[okay so let's take a look because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m20s)

[did we lift all of this stuff out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m29s)

[let's go back here maybe we lifted too](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m32s)

[much](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m34s)

[oh we did we lifted all of it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m40s)

[got it that is problematic](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m49s)

[okay so what we do have in a root](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m54s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h25m59s)

[that's the combo box template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m03s)

[this is what we're expecting to pick up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m07s)

[let's go back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m10s)

[and here oh no](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m13s)

[that one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m16s)

[inside of the combo box template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m17s)

[wait a minute](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m23s)

[wait a minute](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m25s)

[this isn't what we want to edit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m33s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m36s)

[that's why](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m37s)

[hang on we're looking at the wrong thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m38s)

[this is what we want to edit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m41s)

[this guy here okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m48s)

[move move bookmark okay this one is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m50s)

[one that's actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m53s)

[the pop-up content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m55s)

[okay and what we want here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h26m58s)

[is all of this stuff to go away](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m04s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m08s)

[this grid here is ultimately what we'd](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m10s)

[like to replace](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m12s)

[nope wrong grid this grid here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m20s)

[right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m24s)

[oh i'm down once again too high](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m32s)

[there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m36s)

[that grid is what i want to get rid of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m39s)

[because he is the one that is at column](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m42s)

[one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m44s)

[and ultimately where i want to position](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m48s)

[things so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m50s)

[what i want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m53s)

[is this content control](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m55s)

[out of here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h27m58s)

[and i want it there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m00s)

[content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m06s)

[about](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m08s)

[lifted content holder we're gonna](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m09s)

[actually that's not how you spell lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m12s)

[lifted content over we're gonna actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m15s)

[start renaming things because i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m17s)

[i'm quickly gonna get to the point where](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m19s)

[i can't keep my bad naming straight in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m20s)

[my own head](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m22s)

[so we're gonna name it correctly and see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m24s)

[if that solves my problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m25s)

[because that's probably going to make a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m28s)

[bit of a difference i think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m29s)

[naming's hard](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m32s)

[does that old computer science meme](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m34s)

[there are all what is it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m37s)

[there are only two things that are hard](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m39s)

[in computer science](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m41s)

[cash invalidation naming things and off](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m43s)

[by one errors](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m45s)

[or thereabouts](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m47s)

[okay so that is now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m54s)

[okay that's at least consistent behavior](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m56s)

[that's better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h28m58s)

[it's wrong and it's making me question](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m00s)

[some things](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m02s)

[but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m04s)

[it's at least consistent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m06s)

[okay so inside of our pop-up there's our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m09s)

[holder](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m12s)

[he is not getting content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m15s)

[so let's start with the obvious thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m18s)

[make sure we're actually adding it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m22s)

[so boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m27s)

[okay so that's the problem we are not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m30s)

[lifting that thing up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m34s)

[let's grab it here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m37s)

[open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m41s)

[and step out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m48s)

[so if we look at our locals](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m52s)

[um let's see editable text box return to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h29m57s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m00s)

[get parent returned aboard oh because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m03s)

[the parent isn't a panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m06s)

[border is not a panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m12s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m21s)

[is there an xkcd with that meme in it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m23s)

[trying to think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m25s)

[i know i've seen it plastered all over](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m28s)

[the internet so many times with slightly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m30s)

[different variations](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m34s)

[if you find it post the link](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m40s)

[or at least tell me the xkc number](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m42s)

[okay so the issue here is that a border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m49s)

[is not in fact a panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m52s)

[so we go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m55s)

[border b right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m56s)

[this guy does not have a children](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h30m59s)

[collection what he has instead](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m01s)

[is a child](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m04s)

[so we're going to take this out of our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m08s)

[we're going to take this out of this and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m15s)

[what we are going to do is we are going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m17s)

[to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m18s)

[switch on this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m19s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m21s)

[other cool thing you can do in c sharp](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m22s)

[now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m24s)

[is you can just arbitrarily switch on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m26s)

[stuff so if it is a panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m28s)

[then we will do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m33s)

[i don't know do i want to grab parent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m36s)

[i think this is just going to become a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m39s)

[ui element and i don't want to think too](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m41s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m42s)

[so if it is a panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m44s)

[go ahead and move you up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m48s)

[uh and actually i guess what we really](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m51s)

[want is we want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m53s)

[we do want this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m56s)

[but we still want to switch on parent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h31m58s)

[oh but we're not giving this a tie oh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m04s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m06s)

[grumble grumble grumble grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m08s)

[you know what we're just gonna do that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m12s)

[for now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m14s)

[i think that's easier](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m15s)

[and you are unhappy because this wants](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m17s)

[to be a dependency object great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m20s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m23s)

[happier now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m24s)

[thank you so if parent is in fact a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m28s)

[panel we will do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m30s)

[uh p dot children remove](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m37s)

[and then comma not semicolon that one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m40s)

[bites me all the time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m44s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m45s)

[what is your problem here switch](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m50s)

[oh i need um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m53s)

[case](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m57s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h32m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m02s)

[control cannot fall out of a switch from](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m05s)

[final case label yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m06s)

[right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m16s)

[happier now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m20s)

[there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m22s)

[okay the lambda-based one is when you do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m23s)

[a switch expression which is not a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m26s)

[switch statement](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m29s)

[and a switch expression is useful for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m31s)

[returning stuff but we don't really care](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m32s)

[to return stuff here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m34s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m35s)

[uh case](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m37s)

[ui element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m42s)

[element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m43s)

[what was it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m45s)

[here let's start with border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m49s)

[i guess not but i did find the origin at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m50s)

[least origen believes what it is let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m52s)

[look](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h33m55s)

[00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,720](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m03s)

leon if you are in fact the original

[how does this thing only have 1500 likes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m14s)

[i know it's not hip to like something](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m17s)

[from 2010 but you know what i'm doing it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m19s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m21s)

[i'm doing it anyway](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m22s)

[okay and then this guy here is going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m25s)

[be the child property get snowed out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m27s)

[and break](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m32s)

[okay so what is this on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m33s)

[decorator](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m37s)

[okay so if it's a decorator that will go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m41s)

[there that will go there that will clean](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m43s)

[that up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m45s)

[let's rename this real quick](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m47s)

[lifted content see we haven't renamed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m49s)

[the property yet but we're getting close](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m52s)

[we're getting closer](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m54s)

[and then we are going to come down here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h34m56s)

[lifted content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m00s)

[and if parent is in fact set i don't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m04s)

[know if we actually care to do this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m07s)

[because what we're ultimately going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m08s)

[do here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m10s)

[is we are going to once again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m11s)

[on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m17s)

[parent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m18s)

[and actually i'm just going to grab](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m19s)

[these two case statements because these](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m20s)

[are the two that we care about](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m22s)

[except for rather than children](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m23s)

[there we're going to do an ad instead](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m33s)

[don't need that and then in this case](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m36s)

[here child gets](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m38s)

[lifted content just put the guy back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m41s)

[what do you populate switch](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m44s)

[oh dear heavens what do you think you're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m47s)

[going to populate with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m48s)

[oh yeah no we ain't doing that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m52s)

[we ain't doing that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h35m55s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m02s)

[this should hopefully work better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m03s)

[because now we should actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m06s)

[we're just going to break point here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m08s)

[hey break point pretty please thank you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m12s)

[boom and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m18s)

[there we go we actually got inside so we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m20s)

[are gonna actually lift the content now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m22s)

[that'll make a difference let's try the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m24s)

[skin](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m26s)

[that's that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m42s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m47s)

[so aside from not showing up here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m49s)

[so is it being put back appropriately](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m55s)

[let's check that first](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h36m57s)

[because the answer seems to be no](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m00s)

[yeah it's not getting put back so let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m04s)

[grab this here figure out why on clothes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m06s)

[it's not going back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m09s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m11s)

[just step over that and look at our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m13s)

[locals](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m15s)

[so get templated child return no](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m22s)

[oh because that is not the same](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m23s)

[call as that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m27s)

[those are very different](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m29s)

[let's go like that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m32s)

[in reality we should probably take this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m34s)

[look up here and slap it into its own](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m36s)

[method so that it's consistent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m38s)

[but we're just testing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m43s)

[richard's testing again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m45s)

[prove out that it's that this suggestion](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m47s)

[is actually going to work before i get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m50s)

[too far down and the easiest way to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m52s)

[prove that is to copy and paste](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m53s)

[currently](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m56s)

[because if this if i can prove that this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h37m58s)

[actually works for the behavior that we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m00s)

[care about](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m02s)

[we're gonna go for it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m04s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m08s)

[there put it back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m09s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m11s)

[there we go so now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m13s)

[there's that little jump](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m16s)

[there's that flash too that i'm not a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m33s)

[huge fan of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m35s)

[but more importantly it is lifting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m48s)

[everything up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m50s)

[i wish i could get this thing to span](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m55s)

[now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h38m58s)

[that is somewhat related to because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m03s)

[there's a a couple bugs against this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m04s)

[template right now specifically that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m06s)

[changed in the previous behavior and it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m08s)

[was around the alignment of this text](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m10s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m14s)

[because in reality that text box should](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m18s)

[be filling this whole space so and what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m21s)

[i'm noticing is so it's called the eye](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m24s)

[bar](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m26s)

[that what your cursor changes to when](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m27s)

[you're over text](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m29s)

[you'll note as soon as i get beyond the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m30s)

[text it goes back to a regular cursor](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m32s)

[not what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m35s)

[so that means that the text box itself](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m37s)

[that is being populated there is being](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m40s)

[horizontally aligned left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m43s)

[not stretching to fill its container](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m45s)

[space that's a problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m47s)

[i assume you still work just fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m49s)

[because you don't matter yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m51s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m54s)

[yeah yeah okay so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m54s)

[i think that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h39m56s)

[i think this proves that it's going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m00s)

[work](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m02s)

[and we can now start trying to solve](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m03s)

[some of these issues so let's let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m05s)

[clean some code up first](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m06s)

[let's clean some code out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m08s)

[and then we'll start working through all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m11s)

[of the combo boxes so first of all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m13s)

[let's move the logic for getting this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m16s)

[down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m20s)

[private what is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m21s)

[what do i actually need why are we going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m25s)

[content control do you need to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m27s)

[uh it's doing that because it actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m31s)

[needs it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m33s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m39s)

[let's go through and actually declare](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m44s)

[out a template part](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m46s)

[so let's see name](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m50s)

[and by convention these are always all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m52s)

[capital part underscore](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m57s)

[lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h40m58s)

[content is that what we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m00s)

[so we named it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m02s)

[lifted content holder](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m05s)

[i think we can just call it lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m08s)

[content here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m09s)

[type needs to be a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m11s)

[type of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m14s)

[content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m16s)

[control okay so we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m18s)

[oh but i can't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m26s)

[because this isn't the template for the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m30s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m32s)

[where do you get applied](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m35s)

[because this is being applied to a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m37s)

[content control inside of the pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m39s)

[which is not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m41s)

[quite the same](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m42s)

[down content template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m47s)

[i don't think you are used anywhere](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h41m56s)

[yeah that's the problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m01s)

[you know bueno](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m04s)

[where the heck](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m07s)

[it's gonna be in here isn't it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m10s)

[i mean that's mildly convenient if it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m14s)

[just declared in here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m16s)

[update child template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m20s)

[set child template if needed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m23s)

[comes in here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m26s)

[so the other key thing here is i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m32s)

[trying to do this without making it a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m34s)

[breaking change like we could totally](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m35s)

[refactor the whole way that this layout](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m37s)

[of this pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m39s)

[works](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m41s)

[it's not quite what we want to do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m46s)

[i think going back to the other approach](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m52s)

[of just doing this is probably best](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h42m56s)

[so we're going to grab this much of it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m05s)

[so let's go with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m07s)

[content control](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m09s)

[get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m12s)

[a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m13s)

[lifted content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m13s)

[holder](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m16s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m19s)

[we're gonna name it like this anyway](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m22s)

[even though](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m28s)

[that's not quite how it's going to get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m31s)

[referenced](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m34s)

[let's see boom just because this will](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m38s)

[very much indicate to anybody looking at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m41s)

[this what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m43s)

[what the intent is here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m47s)

[because when you see all caps part](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m50s)

[underscore that indicates in wpf that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m52s)

[this is uh a req](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m56s)

[has to say that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h43m59s)

[good enough this is a required uh ui](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m00s)

[element for templating this so if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m03s)

[somebody wants to use this control and i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m05s)

[suspect most people](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m07s)

[are probably not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m09s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m11s)

[or not directly leveraging the uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m14s)

[the pop-up directly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m18s)

[but they could be i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m20s)

[very consistently when i make an](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m22s)

[assumption about how people are using](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m24s)

[the libraries and i do a release i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m25s)

[quickly find out all the ways my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m28s)

[assumptions are wrong](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m29s)

[and i do not mind getting critiqued or](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m32s)

[feedback that is that is excellent i i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m34s)

[very much approve of that but it does](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m37s)

[mean that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m39s)

[i try to be very careful about not just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m41s)

[breaking stuff](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m44s)

[at least not needlessly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m46s)

[okay so that gets me to there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m48s)

[let's rename this because this should be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m55s)

[something more like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h44m58s)

[a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m00s)

[lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m01s)

[content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m02s)

[parent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m03s)

[let's make that a little more obvious](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m04s)

[and then this needs to be renamed as](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m08s)

[well](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m13s)

[lifted content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m17s)

[sounds great put that in there put that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m20s)

[in there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m22s)

[that sounds great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m26s)

[that sounds great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m27s)

[uh that goes like that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m30s)

[for people i'm familiar with the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m33s)

[question mark that i'm putting here that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m36s)

[is the normal reference types in c sharp](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m37s)

[once again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m40s)

[if people are interested to learn more](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m42s)

[about it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m43s)

[the uh that's not what i'm looking for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m45s)

[either those are what i'm after](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m48s)

[i must have closed it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m50s)

[hang on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m52s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m55s)

[spokane.net user group](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m57s)

[again i'm just going to keep plugging](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h45m59s)

[this because this these are going to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m00s)

[some great talks great talks](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m02s)

[i'm not just saying that because i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m05s)

[speaking](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m06s)

[a lot of useful practical information](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m08s)

[there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m10s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m11s)

[okay and then i believe yeah zero](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m13s)

[references so this guy is worthless so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m15s)

[we get rid of him](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m18s)

[you are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m19s)

[you are no longer needed so we come over](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m21s)

[here and we go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m23s)

[another comment i'll make too is even if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m28s)

[you aren't able to make the spokane.net](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m30s)

[user group there is almost assuredly a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m33s)

[user group somewhere nearby you or at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m35s)

[least something that you can watch](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m38s)

[online the fact that you are watching](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m39s)

[this stream now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m41s)

[sort of implies that you have access to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m42s)

[watch videos online](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m44s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m47s)

[quite a few user groups actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m47s)

[put their stuff online i would encourage](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m50s)

[you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m52s)

[to get involved in a user group ideally](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m53s)

[one close to your location](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m56s)

[but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h46m59s)

[any user group will do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m01s)

[or i should say any user group where you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m03s)

[where you're learning things and the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m05s)

[the content is good](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m07s)

[or if you're so inclined oftentimes user](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m10s)

[groups are always in search of speakers](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m13s)

[i say often and always in the same sense](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m16s)

[user groups are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m19s)

[usually short on speakers that's the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m21s)

[that's the hard one and the bar is not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m24s)

[high](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m25s)

[typically the bar is has as something](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m26s)

[that they are willing to present that is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m30s)

[on topic and willing to present](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m31s)

[usually that willing part is where](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m35s)

[things fall down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m38s)

[okay so that gets me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m40s)

[that gets me a much better name](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m45s)

[let's fire this up and make sure we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m48s)

[didn't break anything and that big](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m49s)

[refactor](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m51s)

[and we might go through](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h47m57s)

[trying to decide do we write some tests](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m00s)

[on this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m01s)

[we could break out my xaml test library](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m03s)

[and write some tests](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m04s)

[it might be worthwhile for this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m07s)

[because i'm also noticing that now that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m16s)

[we got this cleaned up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m18s)

[you'll note that positioning is pretty](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m20s)

[close](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m22s)

[all right i'm trying to see if i can get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m28s)

[because if i get my cursor right on the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m30s)

[bottom of that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m31s)

[dollar it's in the same spot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m32s)

[that's pretty good](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m36s)

[that's pretty close so if i can get rid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m37s)

[of that flash](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m39s)

[that would be the kicker](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m45s)

[how could we get rid of the flash](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m49s)

[i don't know if there's going to be a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m56s)

[way to do it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h48m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m01s)

[so there's a couple ideas and we could](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m02s)

[get really fancy here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m04s)

[so let's go here i'm curious at what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m06s)

[point i hit this breakpoint](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m08s)

[pun intended](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m11s)

[okay i kind of want you on the side](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m14s)

[uh minimize you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m20s)

[let's let execution go okay move you to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m23s)

[the side again a little bit bigger a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m25s)

[little bit bigger i'm gonna collapse](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m26s)

[this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m29s)

[first break point hits the pop-up has](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m34s)

[not opened](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m36s)

[second break point the pop-up has not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m39s)

[opened](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m41s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m46s)

[because the pop-up is going to have a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h49m53s)

[the pop-up is going to have a bit of an](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m05s)

[animation on it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m07s)

[so here's so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m09s)

[in order to cut down on the flash](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m10s)

[i'm tempted to throw a visual brush over](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m13s)

[the top of the thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m15s)

[and then swap it once the content's been](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m17s)

[moved](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m20s)

[which would really cut down on the flash](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m21s)

[is it worth going down that much](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m26s)

[headache](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m28s)

[it might be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m30s)

[yeah because even at this point it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m31s)

[already gone](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m33s)

[because i imagine what's actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m34s)

[happening](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m36s)

[is the flash is this content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m37s)

[disappearing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m40s)

[being moved to a pop-up that hasn't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m42s)

[fully been brought in yet](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m44s)

[and i'm wondering if it would be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m50s)

[better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m53s)

[to leave a snapshot in place of this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h50m55s)

[that might not be that bad of an idea](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m05s)

[it also leaves a nice anchor](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m08s)

[that might not be that bad of an idea](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m16s)

[let's let's give it a shot because if we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m20s)

[can grab a visual brush of this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m21s)

[um now i always have to look this up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m24s)

[because i cannot remember](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m26s)

[wpf visual brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m28s)

[i can never remember the magical](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m32s)

[incantation to do this correctly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m34s)

[blah blah blah create a new visual using](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m38s)

[the blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m40s)

[blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m42s)

[um that's not overly helpful](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m45s)

[but let's see diff when you define a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m49s)

[visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m51s)

[when the auto layout content however](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h51m57s)

[the root element is essentially isolated](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m00s)

[from the rest of the system style](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m02s)

[storyboards](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m04s)

[an external layout can't permeate this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m05s)

[boundary therefore you should explicitly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m07s)

[specify the size of the root ui element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m09s)

[because it's only parent is the visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m12s)

[brush and therefore cannot automatically](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m15s)

[size itself](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m17s)

[but this is when you define a new visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m18s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m26s)

[interesting effects such as reflection](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m27s)

[and magnification](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m32s)

[yeah and this is the other thing is we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m38s)

[can freeze it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m40s)

[oh cannot be made frozen when its visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m44s)

[property is set to any](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m47s)

[value other than null well we're about](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m49s)

[to set it to a non-null value okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m51s)

[let's let's give this a try because i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m53s)

[i'm interested to try this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h52m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m01s)

[visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m03s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m04s)

[uh visual brush it's new](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m06s)

[uh did your constructor take in oh it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m09s)

[takes in a visual well how about lifted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m11s)

[content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m13s)

[that seems fine right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m17s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m19s)

[what we want to do is we want to get the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m22s)

[lightest weight thing possible](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m25s)

[what is the easiest way to do this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m33s)

[so i need something because now i've got](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m36s)

[a brush and a brush isn't an element you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m39s)

[can just directly insert into the visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m41s)

[tree you need to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m43s)

[paint something with the brush right so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m45s)

[i've got a paintbrush covered in in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m46s)

[pretty visual element paint](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m48s)

[and so you usually set like a background](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m51s)

[or something on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m53s)

[it just wondering if there is a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h53m54s)

[easy way to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m00s)

[somewhat copy this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m02s)

[i think a canvas might be the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m07s)

[uh let's see background gets](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m15s)

[visual brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m19s)

[c dot width gets](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m21s)

[lifted content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m26s)

[oh actual width](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m28s)

[oh what is lifted content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m30s)

[ui element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m33s)

[so i don't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m38s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m46s)

[change that in a minute but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m50s)

[that'll give me the actual width](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m52s)

[because again we're we're testing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h54m57s)

[actual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m01s)

[height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m03s)

[that should tie that in pretty closely](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m06s)

[which i suppose we can do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m09s)

[i don't know if you've noticed my cursor](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m13s)

[getting lost out in no man's land i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m14s)

[it happened with the latest visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m18s)

[studio update and i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m19s)

[don't know if it's a bug or a feature](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m21s)

[that i haven't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m22s)

[set appropriately or what the deal is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m24s)

[i can just say it's been really annoying](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m26s)

[like this see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m28s)

[i would have expected the cursor when i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m30s)

[go down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m32s)

[to jump me to the end of the line](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m33s)

[because i've got white space turned on i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m34s)

[can see where that is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m36s)

[and i i just don't know what to do with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m38s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m40s)

[okay so if we take that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m42s)

[and in here then we would do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m52s)

[before we remove it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m54s)

[p dot children dot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h55m57s)

[insert](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m01s)

[and then it would be pda children](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m03s)

[index of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m06s)

[lifted content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m08s)

[and we're going to put c in its place](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m10s)

[to out of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m16s)

[behavior to not be a feature i know it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m17s)

[that's why i i part of why i looked at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m20s)

[the preview features in visual studio](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m23s)

[earlier is it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m25s)

[it seems like something that somebody](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m27s)

[intended and it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m29s)

[it only bothers me or i should say it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m31s)

[bothers me most because i leave view](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m33s)

[white space enabled because i like to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m35s)

[able to see what it is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m37s)

[but it feels really wrong](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m40s)

[this just becomes c](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m53s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h56m56s)

[let's just store it here for the moment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m02s)

[uh private](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m05s)

[virtual brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m09s)

[catch that sucker right there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m13s)

[boom this is a case where i would very](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m18s)

[much argue for not using target type new](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m21s)

[expressions](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m24s)

[because this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m25s)

[is not clear this is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m28s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m31s)

[target type new expressions are kind of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m32s)

[like var](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m34s)

[they are awesome when used appropriately](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m35s)

[and can make your code unreadable when](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m37s)

[used inappropriately](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m39s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m42s)

[we want to come in here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m43s)

[so let's see we want to add first and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m45s)

[then we want to do children](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m48s)

[remove](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m50s)

[visual brush don't need to do anything](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m52s)

[here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m55s)

[oh no not visual brush oh i don't want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m57s)

[visual brush do i actually want canvas](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h57m59s)

[suck let's undo all those changes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m02s)

[i just did that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m05s)

[all of that work to catch it and then i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m06s)

[did it completely wrong](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m12s)

[i'll leave it i'll leave it named that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m15s)

[for the moment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m17s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m20s)

[okay and then this means that i just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m27s)

[want to do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m29s)

[after the add p](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m30s)

[children](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m33s)

[remove](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m34s)

[visual brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m36s)

[this extra panel case is actually even](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m38s)

[less concerning right now because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m41s)

[i know we're falling into the decorator](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m45s)

[case because it's a border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m46s)

[and you're unhappy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m50s)

[there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m51s)

[be happy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m52s)

[there you go okay let's give this a shot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m55s)

[i'm curious what this looks like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h58m57s)

[because i'm hoping the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m02s)

[the look we're going for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m04s)

[is right before we take away](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m06s)

[the the text box element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m09s)

[we take a picture of it slap that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m11s)

[picture in its place then remove it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m14s)

[then when it comes up i'm hoping the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m18s)

[only flash we really get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m21s)

[i'm hoping there's not really any flash](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m25s)

[because the pop-up does kind of that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m27s)

[fade-in effect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m28s)

[and it should be theoretically fading](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m29s)

[from the picture to the real element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m31s)

[which if they're lined up appropriately](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m33s)

[should be almost invisible](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m36s)

[and i'm close with i'm totally good with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m39s)

[almost at this point](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m41s)

[let's do prefix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m44s)

[well it definitely slaps a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m53s)

[a thing on there but it is definitely](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=00h59m58s)

[not what i wanted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m00s)

[and it is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m04s)

[definitely](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m06s)

[scaling wrong](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m08s)

[is that still in the right place](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m11s)

[no it moved](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m15s)

[why did that move](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m20s)

[the placement of that is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m26s)

[what's weird to me is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m32s)

[how can i get a picture of it i want to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m36s)

[look at it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m40s)

[oh i know what we can do we can just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m47s)

[if i grab it here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m50s)

[uh let's see there's the combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h00m54s)

[what i'm looking for is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m06s)

[the grid that we lift out of this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m08s)

[there's the combo box it's got to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m16s)

[inside of here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m18s)

[there there's the inner root](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m33s)

[the inner root is what should get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m36s)

[swapped](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m38s)

[so what i'd like to do is do that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m39s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m43s)

[if i do ins](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m46s)

[not magnifier window yeah the magnify](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m48s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m51s)

[and we drag this over here so we can see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m52s)

[it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m55s)

[let's do you like this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h01m58s)

[so the fun magnifier window in snoop](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m02s)

[let's whatever element you're focused on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m04s)

[it it effectively does the visual brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m06s)

[effect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m09s)

[and so you can see here you can even](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m10s)

[split it into a 3d mode so you can get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m12s)

[the the layout of the land of you know](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m14s)

[what's the relationship between all my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m16s)

[components](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m18s)

[which can be very very helpful](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m21s)

[you'll note in 3d mode oftentimes you'll](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m24s)

[see things that aren't actually there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m26s)

[for example clearly all we see is apple](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m30s)

[then you can change the background so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m35s)

[in our case if you are using white text](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m37s)

[i'm just surprised that when i size this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m46s)

[the same way](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m49s)

[how what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h02m58s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m00s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m03s)

[i i'm just confused why i'm getting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m05s)

[yeah it is a really](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m08s)

[especially for wpf snoop is by far my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m10s)

[go-to tool](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m13s)

[there the built-in stuff inside of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m14s)

[visual studio is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m17s)

[good](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m19s)

[so their property explorer the live](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m20s)

[visual tree and whatnot and it has one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m22s)

[feature that snoop doesn't because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m25s)

[visual studio knows about your code you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m27s)

[can actually navigate from the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m29s)

[the tree in visual studio back to your](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m31s)

[xaml when it can find it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m33s)

[so it does have that nice link of going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m35s)

[from my running app to hey where's that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m37s)

[source code file which is great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m39s)

[but snoop has all these other features](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m42s)

[that that one doesn't have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m45s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m47s)

[i really so especially when it comes to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m48s)

[like debugging why something's wrong or](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m51s)

[where my why is my element not there or](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m53s)

[where did it go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m56s)

[snoop is by far my go-to option](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h03m57s)

[what i would love to do though and i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m00s)

[don't know how to grab it because the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m03s)

[combo box is going to close this pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m04s)

[on me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m07s)

[i would love to try and figure out why](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m10s)

[the sizing on that grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m15s)

[because what i really want to do is look](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m21s)

[at that grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m22s)

[like i want to open this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m26s)

[hit refresh without that thing closing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m29s)

[which is not exactly a trivial thing to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m32s)

[do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m34s)

[um i wonder can we grab it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m37s)

[where's the pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m40s)

[can i just do stays open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m44s)

[stays open is already true that is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m50s)

[see the problem is i don't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m53s)

[yeah because internally what's happening](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m57s)

[is the combo box is watching for those](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h04m59s)

[clicks and then it's hiding them and i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m02s)

[wanted to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m04s)

[to to stop watching for those clicks](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m05s)

[how can i get a hold of it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m11s)

[i can't pause the debugger because snoop](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m15s)

[needs the actual ui thread to be running](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m18s)

[in order to produce useful results](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m20s)

[so i can't just pause it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m24s)

[i mean i suppose i could add some debug](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m30s)

[output](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m33s)

[that would not be horrible](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m35s)

[so because we we know what this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m39s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m45s)

[so if we look at say width right because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m50s)

[it looks like it's being spanned](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m53s)

[we're looking for 79](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h05m57s)

[and then so here's the other thing you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m00s)

[can do with snoop](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m02s)

[you can use a pipe](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m04s)

[to to use this filter up here and filter](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m06s)

[down to say things that contain width or](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m09s)

[height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m11s)

[super incredibly handy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m13s)

[you'll also note it is much better at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m15s)

[finding your attached properties](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m17s)

[sometimes too good and you get a whole](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m19s)

[bunch of garbage in your list which is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m21s)

[why you need the filter](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m23s)

[whereas the visual studio one tries to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m26s)

[like group and be a little more](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m27s)

[intelligent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m29s)

[which is good but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m30s)

[again i i think i would prefer to see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m32s)

[all the things and have to filter than](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m35s)

[have something try to guess what i want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m37s)

[and it's not really guess it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m40s)

[doesn't necessarily discover all of them](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m42s)

[or tries to hide the ones that are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m45s)

[clearly irrelevant](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m47s)

[i want to see the irrelevant ones](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m49s)

[see and that's the thing is this border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h06m57s)

[this is okay so let's let's just confirm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m04s)

[this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m07s)

[this parent here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m08s)

[we get the border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m11s)

[we remove the child from it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m12s)

[oh is there a padding or a margin](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m17s)

[between these two is that is that the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m20s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m22s)

[that's something that wouldn't get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m24s)

[picked up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m25s)

[this border has a padding](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m30s)

[but we don't move that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m34s)

[we move the grid this is what's getting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m37s)

[replaced](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m39s)

[well they hold on this is up above](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m43s)

[other bookmark](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m46s)

[okay so there's the combo box template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m54s)

[this guy contains](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h07m58s)

[okay so let's let's let's start with the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m08s)

[obvious](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m10s)

[let's verify that what we get here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m11s)

[actually matches our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m14s)

[seven what is it 79 and 23 6](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m15s)

[give or take a little bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m19s)

[excuse me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m23s)

[01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,839](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m25s)

and that right there is the difference

[we are not getting the same](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m33s)

[size interesting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m36s)

[the border has it but the content itself](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m46s)

[the grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m50s)

[has much shorter content hold up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m51s)

[hold up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h08m55s)

[what is shorting that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m01s)

[is that a problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m07s)

[i mean it could account for the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m11s)

[difference but does that mean that this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m12s)

[guy contains a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m14s)

[margin to make them shorter](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m18s)

[there's no margin there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m22s)

[about padding](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m29s)

[that's not gonna do it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m31s)

[so there is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m41s)

[four on top and four on bottom on the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m44s)

[padding](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m46s)

[i'm just wondering if i'm running into a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m53s)

[situation where](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h09m55s)

[on top and on bottom is different i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m01s)

[maybe i'm fighting a bad problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m03s)

[so let's let's actually okay so here's a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m21s)

[thought let's actually try this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m23s)

[so rather than doing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m26s)

[this stuff let's drop in c](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m29s)

[go the other direction](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m32s)

[so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m35s)

[actually let's do this we're gonna](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m38s)

[comment out all of this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m40s)

[so rather than moving the con](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m42s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m44s)

[the grid](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m46s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m47s)

[content get c so we'll leave the thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m49s)

[there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m52s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h10m57s)

[just not put it back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m00s)

[that sounds that sounds good](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m04s)

[because now this will give us an easier](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m07s)

[way to view it and more importantly if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m09s)

[this ends up looking fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m11s)

[this will prove whether this option](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m14s)

[works](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m19s)

[because this will](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m20s)

[effectively do the cloning](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m22s)

[just won't be interactable which is fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m25s)

[that's not what we need to test at the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m27s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m28s)

[the question is can we get away with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m29s)

[fixing this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m31s)

[okay so that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m34s)

[that's nicer in that it gives me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m37s)

[yeah you'll note it doesn't show me the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m42s)

[the eye bar at all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m44s)

[but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m45s)

[you'll know the visual brush is actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m46s)

[intelligent like it's updating as the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m48s)

[cursor's flashing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m53s)

[pretty cool brush](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m54s)

[but it also now means this is gonna be a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h11m58s)

[little bit easier now for us to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m00s)

[hijack this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m02s)

[and take a look at him so he is in fact](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m05s)

[15 6](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m08s)

[and 79](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m10s)

[which i believe is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m12s)

[exact size we wanted him to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m14s)

[15 6 and 79.](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m21s)

[so he is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m24s)

[the exact same size so why is he](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m26s)

[stretching](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m28s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m30s)

[i hang on hang on i'm an idiot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m32s)

[there's a property on here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m35s)

[that is something like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m38s)

[was its](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m41s)

[stretch](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m42s)

[almost like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m43s)

[there was a stretch property on it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m45s)

[none](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m49s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m53s)

[let's see if that looks a little better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h12m54s)

[i'm pretty sure it defaults to uniform](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m00s)

[we could go look](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m10s)

[let's make sure this works](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m16s)

[hey look at that that is better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m19s)

[still not aligning correctly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m22s)

[but we're no longer stretching](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m25s)

[which is better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m35s)

[yeah we're now just being aligned](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m38s)

[center instead of left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m41s)

[okay so that that'll so the stretch was](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m43s)

[clearly problem one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m46s)

[so let's see here so that is there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m48s)

[what is the best way to handle this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h13m59s)

[because is it the background that's a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m05s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m11s)

[tile mode it shouldn't be tiling at all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m20s)

[yeah so the tile mode especially these](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m29s)

[flipped ones are very helpful for that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m31s)

[like that mirroring effect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m39s)

[let's see here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m40s)

[alignment boy that looks remarkably like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m47s)

[it might be problematic](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m50s)

[that it's defaulting to center](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m55s)

[stretch is defaulting to fill](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h14m57s)

[so let's set the alignment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m01s)

[i think left and top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m06s)

[uh because the sizes are going to match](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m09s)

[i'm pretty sure that's exactly what i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m11s)

[want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m13s)

[i'm just trying to decide if that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m16s)

[going to be problematic at all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m18s)

[see the fact that i was able to tab into](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m22s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m24s)

[and the intellicode just guessed what](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m25s)

[was correct](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m27s)

[is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m28s)

[just gotta throw that out there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m30s)

[oftentimes though the intellicode is not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m34s)

[guaranteed that its guesses will even](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m36s)

[compile so just be aware that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m38s)

[sometimes it tries to be helpful and it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m42s)

[ends up causing more problems than it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m44s)

[worth](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m46s)

[okay so that's better](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m48s)

[definitely still bouncing up a little](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m52s)

[let's go let's take off the top i do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h15m59s)

[wonder if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m02s)

[this is where i'm wondering if there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m03s)

[might end up being a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m05s)

[position but the flash is gone](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m06s)

[which means the visual brush is a viable](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m11s)

[solution for that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m13s)

[what is going on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m25s)

[sorry i was hearing a noise but i think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m26s)

[it's actually coming from the background](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m28s)

[music](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m29s)

[jumping a little bit which isn't exactly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m34s)

[surprising](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m36s)

[and there might just be a little bit of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m47s)

[alignment here okay so i think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m49s)

[the visual brush has proven its worth](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m51s)

[now let's go reinvert these](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m53s)

[and put them back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m57s)

[so that we get the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h16m58s)

[behavior we want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m01s)

[put you back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m03s)

[put you back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m06s)

[and this should](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m12s)

[should just work](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m14s)

[probably get us a lot better and i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m19s)

[wondering if by doing this back in the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m21s)

[other order our alignment problems are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m23s)

[going to go away](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m25s)

[cheers](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m31s)

[i have to check and see what the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m51s)

[behavior is but i think that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m53s)

[consistent](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m55s)

[yeah so aside from the hopping maneuver](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h17m58s)

[it's doing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m00s)

[aside from that hopping maneuver and i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m26s)

[think that's what i'm probably going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m29s)

[trade the bugs out for is a slight hop](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m30s)

[will be the new i see a line behavior](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m33s)

[i think i like it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m44s)

[okay the suffix text is not being](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m56s)

[aligned appropriately okay so there's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h18m58s)

[there are bugs all over this combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m00s)

[template but we're gonna try and fix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m02s)

[them](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m04s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m05s)

[step one commit what we've got](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m10s)

[commit what we've got because it is it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m13s)

[is in a working state and we are happy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m15s)

[with it or i am happy with it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m17s)

[so let's do this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m21s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m27s)

[lifting content is now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m29s)

[working](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m32s)

[stage all changes commit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m33s)

[push](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m38s)

[okay so given that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m40s)

[that's now in and going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m44s)

[it's just that hop i think that's left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m52s)

[so perhaps we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h19m58s)

[do we try to write a test on this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m01s)

[i think we do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m06s)

[i think we do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m08s)

[let's let's write some tests](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m09s)

[let's write some tests because we can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m11s)

[actually write tests over this now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m13s)

[which is awesome](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m16s)

[not there uh ui test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m18s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m21s)

[uh combo box test we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m24s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m27s)

[i wrote this lovely library called xaml](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m28s)

[test it is awesome i love it but i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m30s)

[biased what do i know](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m33s)

[uh let's see github](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m35s)

[example test and its purpose in life for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m38s)

[anybody interested in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m41s)

[is to provide a nice easy way of doing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m44s)

[ui tests for this kind of stuff so for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m46s)

[example we are working on a combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m48s)

[template and we want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m51s)

[our that the text box inside of it is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m53s)

[aligned correctly there's not an easy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m55s)

[way to do that you either write a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m57s)

[regular unit test which trying to do ui](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h20m58s)

[related stuff without the full wpf stack](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m01s)

[is miserable or you do a ui test which](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m04s)

[goes through the accessibility layer to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m06s)

[try to simulate user interaction and it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m08s)

[doesn't give you the fine grained](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m10s)

[control that you need over the elements](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m12s)

[of a template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m14s)

[this fills that middle gap that's that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m17s)

[is its purpose in life so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m19s)

[what it does is it spins up a whole wpf](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m22s)

[window so you've got the full power of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m24s)

[wpf at your fingertips](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m26s)

[but then allows you to dive into the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m29s)

[visual tree and muck with stuff](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m30s)

[just like snoop which is awesome](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m33s)

[so you can do stuff like this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m36s)

[which is great so we are going to do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m39s)

[we are going to do that so we're going](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m43s)

[to start with this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m47s)

[i kind of feel like i want to go grab](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m48s)

[the issue number real quick uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m50s)

[the ax](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m53s)

[so let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m58s)

[and really i know this is the last](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h21m59s)

[i know it's the one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m02s)

[the milestone is not working](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m05s)

[so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m08s)

[we're in a powwow there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m10s)

[so how about](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m12s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m14s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m15s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m16s)

[so uh the test recorder is just there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m18s)

[for taking screenshots and whatnot so if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m20s)

[things fail makes it a little bit easier](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m22s)

[on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m25s)

[edible](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m27s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m28s)

[open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m30s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m33s)

[maintains](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m34s)

[its position](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m36s)

[okay so let's start with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m41s)

[maybe we just pick on the same let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m44s)

[just go grab that bit of xaml from the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m47s)

[demo app i think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m48s)

[that way we can pick on something real](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m52s)

[ish so not the os one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m54s)

[this guy so this is our bit of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h22m56s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m00s)

[so we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m02s)

[boom drop that in there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m04s)

[and oh we got a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m06s)

[we're inside of a string literal so we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m08s)

[got to clean some of this up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m10s)

[uh let's see let's clean that up uh we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m13s)

[don't actually care about hint opacity](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m16s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m17s)

[that's a non-issue](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m18s)

[i'm gonna do this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m21s)

[let's see i'm gonna indent you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m29s)

[i'll do you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m31s)

[do you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m34s)

[boom oh did they add like multi-cursor](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m38s)

[support or something](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m41s)

[really hoping there would be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m43s)

[multi-cursor support like there is in vs](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m45s)

[code](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m47s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m48s)

[if there is it's not using the same](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m49s)

[shortcuts as vs code so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m51s)

[i won't look for it yet okay so that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m54s)

[going to give us that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m56s)

[um okay so this will load xaml and give](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h23m59s)

[us back our root element from the xaml](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m02s)

[that it loads which is a stack panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m04s)

[great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m06s)

[um i this is a custom method i put](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m07s)

[inside of this library it it loads up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m10s)

[the app with all the material design](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m12s)

[library windows which is perfect that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m14s)

[what we want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m15s)

[grabs all of this stuff and so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m18s)

[once we grab the combo box i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m22s)

[we then want to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m25s)

[uh let's put you all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m29s)

[undo undo and do a do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m31s)

[there perfect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m33s)

[let's go back](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m34s)

[i then want to grab](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m36s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m38s)

[name of that lovely little guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m42s)

[let's see here so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m47s)

[themes combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m51s)

[actually i should have just done this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m53s)

[got it so i want to grab this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h24m56s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m04s)

[just grab him out so by default the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m06s)

[getelement method will hunt for things](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m08s)

[by name so if you do nothing else to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m10s)

[your query it just hunts it by x name](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m13s)

[which i found to be rather convenient](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m15s)

[you can hunt by type or by property and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m17s)

[this thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m20s)

[accepts indexes and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m23s)

[all kinds of cool stuff okay so we don't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m24s)

[want to get the font size out of though](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m27s)

[what we want to get is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m28s)

[get coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m31s)

[um and how about we rename this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m36s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m42s)

[closed coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m47s)

[so this will return back and we are not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m49s)

[going to use a var here it's explicit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m51s)

[type](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m54s)

[we want the rect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h25m58s)

[and i'm trying to remember this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m00s)

[good they are doubles](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m06s)

[and then what we want to do is we would](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m07s)

[like to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m09s)

[open the combo box so we also should](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m10s)

[probably pull out the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m12s)

[drop down button i guess](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m17s)

[i'm just trying to think of what's the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m21s)

[best thing on this because it's editable](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m22s)

[where you click matters](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m25s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m29s)

[yeah let's just do toggle button that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m35s)

[seems like a reasonable way to do it i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m37s)

[just wondering should i grab it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m38s)

[let's not hunt by name let's grab by](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m42s)

[type i think it's probably the most](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m44s)

[reasonable](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m47s)

[toggle](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m50s)

[button](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m52s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m55s)

[toggle button](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m57s)

[and then we will](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h26m59s)

[await](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m02s)

[toggle button](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m05s)

[left click](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m07s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m09s)

[and then we want to await](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m10s)

[task dot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m13s)

[delay for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m14s)

[300 milliseconds](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m16s)

[only this is one of the only areas that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m18s)

[i'm not overly happy with this is when](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m20s)

[you know there's animation](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m22s)

[there's not a great way to say wait](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m24s)

[until it's done animated](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m26s)

[you just kind of have to time it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m29s)

[don't like that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m34s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m40s)

[we could do an await](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m41s)

[and then a weight four](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m44s)

[all right so we'll do this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m47s)

[and we will wait for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h27m55s)

[correct open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m00s)

[coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m02s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m07s)

[a weight](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m08s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m11s)

[uh oh this needs to be an async delegate](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m13s)

[this thing does have an overload for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m16s)

[funk of tasks so this will work](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m17s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m21s)

[we will go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m23s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m24s)

[ah do we go equal](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m28s)

[i feel like i want to say are close](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m31s)

[enough](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m33s)

[let's do this let's just look at the top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m37s)

[left corner](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m39s)

[if the top left corner of the text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m41s)

[is within](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m43s)

[a pixel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m44s)

[we'll call that success](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m46s)

[so let's do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m48s)

[open coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m50s)

[top left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h28m58s)

[minus](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m00s)

[close coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m02s)

[top left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m04s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m10s)

[so if you take two points and subtract](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m12s)

[them it returns back the distance](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m19s)

[so we will assert that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m21s)

[distance](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m25s)

[dot length](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m27s)

[is less than or equal to one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m28s)

[true](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m32s)

[and this magical little weight will](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m33s)

[retry for a few times by default it'll](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m35s)

[try three times with a slight delay in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m37s)

[it i don't remember exactly what it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m40s)

[set to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m41s)

[but it gives you a little bit more](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m43s)

[rather than just blindly doing the delay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m46s)

[it gives you a little more flexibility i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m48s)

[just i need a little bit of a delay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m50s)

[because i don't want this first one to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m52s)

[occur](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m53s)

[before the swap happens i want to ensure](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m54s)

[that there's been enough time to at](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m56s)

[least hit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m57s)

[that opened event handler and let it do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h29m58s)

[its thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m00s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m02s)

[now this test should fail](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m03s)

[because we haven't fixed it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m07s)

[this is good testing practice you start](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m09s)

[with a failing test and then tweak it so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m11s)

[that it passes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m13s)

[okay we failed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m26s)

[uh but we did not fail for the reason we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m31s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m33s)

[example test element of type text box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m37s)

[does not match the desired type of text](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m43s)

[block](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m45s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m47s)

[we should make those match](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m52s)

[try again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m55s)

[the other thing that's nice about this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m57s)

[is we can actually like pause the test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h30m58s)

[and like play with the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m00s)

[running wpf app and whatnot with snoop](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m02s)

[so you saw how it stayed open for a bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m07s)

[failed time out of three attempts two](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m09s)

[seconds](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m12s)

[exceeded](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m13s)

[so it failed to find a reasonable match](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m18s)

[so what i'd like to do now is put this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m22s)

[to the side and i just want to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m24s)

[test this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m26s)

[so the wait for worth noting it'll](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m31s)

[um it'll either try for two seconds or](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m34s)

[it'll try](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m37s)

[up to three times](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m38s)

[oh did i just click and mess it up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m40s)

[i think i clicked and messed it up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m42s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m45s)

[oh this is going to be fun](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m46s)

[i actually want to catch it here don't i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m49s)

[let's stop this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m52s)

[um because if i don't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h31m53s)

[and we got a shut down xaml test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m00s)

[just probably hung at this point](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m09s)

[slack is apparently busy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m11s)

[oh did it shut down on its own](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m16s)

[oh good good good good good good i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m18s)

[wasn't sure which version of xaml test i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m20s)

[had in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m22s)

[the library does have a when there's no](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m23s)

[debugger attached it does have a drop](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m25s)

[dead on it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m27s)

[so if it doesn't if or i should say it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m29s)

[has a heartbeat](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m31s)

[so if it's able to communicate for so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m32s)

[long and the heartbeat doesn't fire it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m34s)

[goes](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m36s)

[dead](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m37s)

[just perfect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m39s)

[okay so let's try this one more time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m41s)

[because i'd like to see what that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m44s)

[distance is and just verify that this is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m46s)

[roughly what we expect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m48s)

[right like that's what we're going for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m50s)

[open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m52s)

[distance](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h32m58s)

[length is four](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m01s)

[that's roughly what we're seeing is a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m03s)

[bounce of four](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m04s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m09s)

[i think what i would like to do though](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m10s)

[here is add one more](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m11s)

[or i guess a couple more things or](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m16s)

[alignment gets](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m20s)

[center](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m22s)

[let's just make sure that we get the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m33s)

[same behavior here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m34s)

[should be the same behavior i don't see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m41s)

[why it wouldn't be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m43s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m46s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m50s)

[interesting that that pop-up was so high](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m51s)

[up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m53s)

[oh this is a stack panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h33m58s)

[i should really not specify these on the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m01s)

[combo box and instead put them up here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m03s)

[on the stack panel](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m06s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m14s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m15s)

[run one more time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m16s)

[i just want to move the the combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m18s)

[into the middle of the window so that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m20s)

[there's less](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m22s)

[weirdness with like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m24s)

[the potential](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m27s)

[let's do this here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m29s)

[just to make sure there's no weird um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m33s)

[collisions with like window border that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m35s)

[kind of thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m37s)

[sometimes when you're trying to click if](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m38s)

[you get too close to the border you can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m40s)

[have things overlap so i try to just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m41s)

[inset everything](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m43s)

[okay that seems fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m46s)

[and you'll note by default it sets top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m51s)

[most on the window too just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m53s)

[for things like that where you click on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m55s)

[visual studio you don't necessarily want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m57s)

[to take focus away from it you want it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h34m58s)

[to write on top of everything etc](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m00s)

[all those things can be configured but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m03s)

[okay so we've got a failing test perfect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m07s)

[this is what we would like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m09s)

[now we would like to fix the test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m11s)

[so let's go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m14s)

[here and figure out the appropriate way](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m16s)

[to fix this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m20s)

[we're off by 4 pixels](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m21s)

[and if we look at this guy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m26s)

[i i'm hang on i think the issue might it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m32s)

[might be pretty easy to solve](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m35s)

[because this is going to be in the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m38s)

[combo box pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m41s)

[and this is going to be in the placement](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m44s)

[callback](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m46s)

[placement property blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h35m50s)

[yeah so there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m00s)

[so you get used where](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m05s)

[uh that's not quite what i want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m12s)

[property change callback create template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m18s)

[property changed](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m21s)

[no this isn't quite](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m24s)

[cast is redundant](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m36s)

[am i missing something is it because of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m41s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m44s)

[i don't think this cast is redundant](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m47s)

[that's a double](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m51s)

[minus a double](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m52s)

[without the int](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m55s)

[the int is there for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h36m59s)

[dropping it off](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m01s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m08s)

[uh get positioning data this is where i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m09s)

[think we might need to do some work](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m12s)

[so let's see here visual ancestry of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m15s)

[type visual last or default control](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m18s)

[visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m20s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m24s)

[let's let's work through this here so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m26s)

[this is what is actually getting used to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m27s)

[position](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m29s)

[right so if we look here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m30s)

[custom placement callback yeah perfect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m35s)

[so it grabs the visual ancestry walking](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m39s)

[through it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m42s)

[gets positional data](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m43s)

[great tries to figure out if he should](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m47s)

[open](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m49s)

[up or down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m50s)

[setting the appropriate placement](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m52s)

[accordingly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h37m54s)

[and all of that jazz](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m02s)

[get up pop-up placement get down pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m05s)

[placement](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m08s)

[from data so these ones here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m09s)

[offset x new down y](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m14s)

[so it's this positioning data that is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m17s)

[likely](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m19s)

[to blame](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m21s)

[and the whole reason for this is because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m32s)

[the pop-up by default in wpf if you just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m34s)

[give it a placement target what it does](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m37s)

[is it aligns itself nicely to the based](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m39s)

[on the properties on your pop-up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m42s)

[typically what it will do is it'll align](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m44s)

[to the bottom of the placement target](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m46s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m48s)

[most of the time in this case we don't](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m50s)

[want the pop-up to align to the base of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m52s)

[our uh combo box we want to shift it up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m54s)

[and make sure that the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h38m58s)

[content that we lifted lands right on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m00s)

[top of where it was](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m02s)

[it's ultimately what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m03s)

[i wonder if we could leverage that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m07s)

[in these calculations](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m11s)

[so this is grabbing the placement target](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m14s)

[which if we look here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m17s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m19s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m23s)

[placement custom do you have placement](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m26s)

[target specified](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m29s)

[it does so the template root is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m35s)

[target](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m37s)

[um where is that element so it's okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m40s)

[so it's targeting this border that's its](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m46s)

[placement target is this border](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m48s)

[great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m52s)

[so that's what it's going to look for](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m54s)

[it's going to grab](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m56s)

[the top left corner of that border and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h39m57s)

[get its screen coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m00s)

[screen coordinates that's important](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m03s)

[let's see main visual so it's going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m06s)

[go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m07s)

[and go hunting](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m10s)

[for the last and the first visual](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m14s)

[element](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m16s)

[screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m19s)

[from point](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m20s)

[why the heck are we doing this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m23s)

[oh this is determining what screen that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m27s)

[point is on](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m29s)

[okay so multi monitor](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m31s)

[screen width screen height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m33s)

[okay so this is to determine are we too](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m37s)

[close to an edge because if you bring](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m40s)

[the combo box down to the bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m41s)

[you want to open up instead of down that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m44s)

[kind of thing adjust location to be in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m46s)

[terms of current screen so location x](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m48s)

[location y](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m51s)

[so this should take the point that we](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m52s)

[calculated](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m54s)

[given that we're now inside of screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m56s)

[bounds because these bounds can very](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h40m58s)

[easily be um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m01s)

[negative](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m02s)

[for example in your](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m04s)

[uh monitor setup](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m06s)

[if your primary monitor is say in the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m08s)

[middle and you've got a screen left and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m10s)

[right the screen left is going to have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m11s)

[negative coordinates because it is left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m14s)

[of where you set your zero](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m16s)

[so just something to keep in mind](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m19s)

[because i know we've been bitten by that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m21s)

[bug on this library already](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m22s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m26s)

[and then we also have to concern](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m27s)

[ourselves with dpi because we've gone](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m29s)

[to screen coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m33s)

[transform device y](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m37s)

[right i assume that i believe this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m40s)

[method is the standard calculation right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m42s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m47s)

[standard dpi](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m49s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h41m56s)

[up vertical offset](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m10s)

[is this being set to something different](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m13s)

[uh obs vertical offset is being set to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m18s)

[15.](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m21s)

[kind of wondering if that's gonna do it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m36s)

[let's go back to our test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m38s)

[stop executing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m43s)

[debug test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m46s)

[i have a feeling](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h42m54s)

[that that's going to get us darn close](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m02s)

[if you go off to the side for a minute](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m16s)

[length is a four](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m24s)

[really](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m27s)

[so it's jumping up still](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m30s)

[oh did i change up or down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m36s)

[it could be part of the problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m39s)

[i changed up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m44s)

[debug test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m56s)

[this is the beauty of having these tests](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h43m58s)

[is that it will be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m00s)

[it makes it easy to tweak the templates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m03s)

[verify the condition that we're after](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m05s)

[without having to like start the demo](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m07s)

[app every time](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m08s)

[sometimes setting these tests up can be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m10s)

[a little bit of a pain if the condition](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m11s)

[is not easy but this one the conditions](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m13s)

[pretty straightforward](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m16s)

[length is less than one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m28s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m32s)

[let's see how it feels](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m39s)

[because that did still show a fraction](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m40s)

[of a pixel off](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m43s)

[man we might be able to get it closer](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m49s)

[but](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m51s)

[i hate fighting over fractions of a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m52s)

[pixel especially going to screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m54s)

[coordinates where you aren't going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m56s)

[get fractional bits](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h44m57s)

[it's gonna be a little more challenging](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m02s)

[there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m04s)

[i think i might be okay with that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m08s)

[i think i might be okay with that that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m12s)

[is beautiful](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m14s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m16s)

[now we just have to fix all the other](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m19s)

[bugs so we need the up template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m21s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m24s)

[let's see up we need to fix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m26s)

[we need to fix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m30s)

[up and classic i should probably test it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m44s)

[should probably clean this up because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m58s)

[it's going to start getting long this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h45m59s)

[spins a new version of the app for every](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m01s)

[test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m03s)

[you can actually condense this down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m05s)

[significantly](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m07s)

[so one thing i will demonstrate real](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m09s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m11s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m17s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m20s)

[saml test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m21s)

[so if we look at the test that i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m37s)

[oh this is the actual test library sam](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m39s)

[will test test because naturally](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m41s)

[creating the app when you call the uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m47s)

[the start calls on here so in this case](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m50s)

[start remote this is spinning a new wpf](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m52s)

[building it up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m57s)

[doing it on a class initialize means](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h46m59s)

[it'll do it once for this entire class](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m02s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m05s)

[uh thing that typically matters](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m06s)

[is you want to then clear the content so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m09s)

[there's helpers for like set xaml](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m12s)

[content so it'll drop as long as you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m13s)

[aren't setting things in like your app](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m15s)

[level resources that need to change](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m17s)

[and whatnot if it's just the contents of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m19s)

[the window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m22s)

[spin one window change out the contents](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m23s)

[every time and then your test runs much](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m25s)

[quicker because you don't have the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m27s)

[overhead of spinning a process](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m28s)

[so that is one thing that i've done](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m31s)

[on these tests here which is great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m34s)

[i don't know a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m39s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m45s)

[i i know x unit supports it but not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m47s)

[gonna worry about it for the moment not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m50s)

[gonna worry about it for the moment okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m51s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m53s)

[let's do the up template because that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m55s)

[one](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m57s)

[should be broken too right now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h47m59s)

[uh edible combo box](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m01s)

[open up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m04s)

[text box maintains its position so we're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m06s)

[going to change this to open down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m08s)

[d](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m12s)

[o w n](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m13s)

[okay and then i would like to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m14s)

[how do i force you into the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m18s)

[up versus down case](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m26s)

[is it here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m32s)

[yeah so i can do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m34s)

[pop-up placement up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m37s)

[is what i want for my test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m39s)

[so here what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m42s)

[is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m45s)

[oh how do i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m48s)

[this is on the pop-up what is on the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h48m52s)

[what gives me access to the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m02s)

[you don't give me direct access to that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m09s)

[do you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m12s)

[um how can i force you to open up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m23s)

[how can i force you to open up](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m26s)

[i could go and grab the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m31s)

[because i can get in and muck with this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m35s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m36s)

[that's totally a thing i can do because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m38s)

[of xaml test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m41s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m43s)

[but i'm trying to decide at what point i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m45s)

[would want to do that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m55s)

[that's not quite what i want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h49m56s)

[do you actually get used](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m09s)

[i'm just noticing i only see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m12s)

[these](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m15s)

[do you get placed here at all](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m16s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m24s)

[this may be a fairly unused thing i'm](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m27s)

[guessing this up value](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m29s)

[find all references](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m32s)

[oh set current value this is where it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m40s)

[gets used](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m42s)

[prefer up if safe](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m47s)

[so in order to do this i have to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m53s)

[basically push the combo box down next](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m55s)

[to the bottom of the screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h50m58s)

[not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m09s)

[the greatest option available](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m10s)

[do i have access to the screen stuff](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m13s)

[i think it's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m17s)

[internal](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m18s)

[yeah i made it internal for a reason](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m20s)

[basically leeched all the stuff out of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m28s)

[wind forms for getting access to this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m30s)

[to pull it in](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m34s)

[excuse me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m41s)

[what is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m42s)

[how do i test this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m46s)

[i mean we can come over here and i can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m49s)

[i can somewhat visually test it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m53s)

[because if i bring this guy way down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h51m59s)

[here to the bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m00s)

[just set him right there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m04s)

[oh but we haven't overridden that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m14s)

[template yet](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m23s)

[we overrode this template](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m26s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m29s)

[but we did not and this is the down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m32s)

[we need the up template to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m36s)

[overwritten](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m37s)

[i don't care about you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h52m42s)

[oh actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m02s)

[a little curious now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m29s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m31s)

[well we should be able to test this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m35s)

[if i do this now](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m38s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m47s)

[not a good thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h53m49s)

[yeah so that's uh not great](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m04s)

[okay so that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m17s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m27s)

[so that's not correct i don't know how](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m31s)

[to force this in a test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m33s)

[because i can push the window down like](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m38s)

[up and down you can get a hold of the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m40s)

[wpf window and move it around that's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m41s)

[fine but where to move it to is the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m44s)

[question and that would require](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m46s)

[knowing screen coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m48s)

[which requires going through the screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m52s)

[class which is internal and i do not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m54s)

[wish to make it public](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m56s)

[and i would like to avoid internals](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h54m58s)

[visible 2.](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m00s)

[so here's what we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m09s)

[we are going to do something](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m10s)

[a little bit crazy a little bit crazy so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m13s)

[add](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m16s)

[existing item](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m18s)

[we're gonna back up a little and we're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m20s)

[gonna we're gonna come at it from a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m22s)

[different](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m24s)

[a different angle let's say](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m25s)

[and we're gonna add his link](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m28s)

[now normally this is a bad idea](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m32s)

[now i got access to it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m38s)

[done](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m40s)

[okay so now we can](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m41s)

[now we can do this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m44s)

[so vertical alignment](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m47s)

[bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m50s)

[okay so we are going to take the stack](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m53s)

[panel send it to the bottom of our](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m54s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m55s)

[all the way down we're gonna get it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m57s)

[right about to the bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h55m58s)

[back it up just a little bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m00s)

[then open it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m03s)

[that's that's the game plan](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m05s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m08s)

[vertical alignment bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m10s)

[we want to get ourselves a hold of the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m14s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m16s)

[create window with so this is creating](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m20s)

[us a window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m22s)

[and we're throwing that window away how](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m24s)

[can i hold on to that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m27s)

[what if i would like to hold on to that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m29s)

[because this is this here is obviously a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m33s)

[helper i built for the material design](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m35s)

[project so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m37s)

[i think what i want to do is separate](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m46s)

[out these two calls](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h56m48s)

[create](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m03s)

[let's say create](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m04s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m12s)

[like that guy there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m17s)

[and then we're just gonna grab this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m20s)

[whole little bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m22s)

[now steal you put you there](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m25s)

[we're going to return you](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m29s)

[and so this is going to be then](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m32s)

[window window gets create window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m36s)

[let's see app xaml](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m40s)

[no](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m48s)

[and this needs to be weighted](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m49s)

[and then we can pull that out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m54s)

[that means i can now in my test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h57m56s)

[change this up from load xaml because](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m00s)

[load xaml is just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m02s)

[let's let's](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m18s)

[thinly veil it up a little more though](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m22s)

[load saml](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m23s)

[what is it squawking about](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m47s)

[i want it to hit my overload](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m50s)

[hey](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m57s)

[navigate](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h58m58s)

[create window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m00s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m04s)

[no generic](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m07s)

[okay so that'll spin me the window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m08s)

[and then it'll be up to me to just go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m11s)

[get the element that's fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m12s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m14s)

[that'll be it that'll be okay so we're](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m16s)

[going to change this to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m18s)

[how about we go var window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m20s)

[gets load window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m25s)

[and then we're going to feed it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m27s)

[all of this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m31s)

[and then because of the awesomeness of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m35s)

[how this works we're just going to](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m37s)

[ignore the stack panel completely](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m38s)

[this will become](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m42s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m44s)

[this is a weight](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m46s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m49s)

[oh this needs to be something like app](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m53s)

[dot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=01h59m55s)

[load](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m06s)

[create window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m14s)

[oh no but i do want to land here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m22s)

[load xaml window oh but i don't want](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m25s)

[this to be generic](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m27s)

[that's the problem](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m29s)

[because i still wanted to initialize the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m31s)

[app for me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m32s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m34s)

[load xaml window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m36s)

[and this is an eye window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m39s)

[okay so this gets me this this gives me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m42s)

[this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m44s)

[this gets me all the things okay now um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m46s)

[push the window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m50s)

[near the bottom of the screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m53s)

[so let's see window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h00m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m03s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m11s)

[wrecked](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m13s)

[uh window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m14s)

[boards gets a weight](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m17s)

[uh okay and then i want to do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m23s)

[screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m26s)

[dot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m29s)

[uh from point](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m30s)

[window chords top left](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m33s)

[okay and so now we need to figure out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m47s)

[how far to push this thing down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m54s)

[so this will give me the coordinates of](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m56s)

[my window which will conveniently](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m57s)

[contain](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h01m59s)

[the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m01s)

[height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m02s)

[all right because i'm going to get](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m06s)

[all of the stuff so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m08s)

[if we know the combo box is at the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m10s)

[bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m12s)

[i basically want to know](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m16s)

[you know actually if we do this based](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m20s)

[upon bottom left this might be easier](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m21s)

[i guess in terms of getting the screen](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m26s)

[it doesn't matter but the amount that i](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m28s)

[want to push it down is going to be](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m30s)

[screen dot](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m34s)

[height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m36s)

[no screen.bounds.height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m42s)

[so that will give me the height of my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m43s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m45s)

[i want to find the distance between it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m49s)

[and the bottom of my window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m52s)

[so subtract](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m56s)

[window coordinates](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h02m59s)

[bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m04s)

[edge](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m07s)

[uh let's see height](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m11s)

[above](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m16s)

[amount to move](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m18s)

[and then we're gonna go minus](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m20s)

[50.](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m22s)

[some margin we may play with that a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m24s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m26s)

[and then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m27s)

[window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m28s)

[uh set](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m30s)

[top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m32s)

[gets window chords](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m33s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m37s)

[top](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m39s)

[plus amount to move](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m40s)

[and we're gonna see](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m45s)

[if this works i did just edit the right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m48s)

[test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m50s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m52s)

[dang it i edited the wrong test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m53s)

[edited the wrong test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h03m58s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m02s)

[and hold down the undo button](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m20s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m23s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m29s)

[now we try again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m33s)

[we want to grab it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m36s)

[i think we just grab it here there's not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m39s)

[a](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m41s)

[not a big point in grabbing it before](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m41s)

[that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m43s)

[so i think we're just going to step over](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m46s)

[it all anyway none of these things are](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m47s)

[actually acting on data](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h04m49s)

[uh we aired out](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m10s)

[what did we do](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m14s)

[material design is an undeclared](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m16s)

[prefix](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m20s)

[that tells me that my](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m21s)

[initialize did not initialize with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m24s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m35s)

[create window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m35s)

[create window with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m39s)

[calls this create window](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m42s)

[what does this create window call it](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m45s)

[with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m47s)

[that is not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m51s)

[with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m57s)

[content](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h05m59s)

[so we need to land here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m01s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m06s)

[what we'll do is we'll leave this called](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m08s)

[create window but we'll just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m10s)

[flip it over here](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m13s)

[because we we need to land on this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m23s)

[overload not the built-in one to the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m25s)

[library](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m27s)

[okay uh debug test again](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m28s)

[go go test](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m32s)

[and](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m42s)

[let's move you to the side just a little](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m46s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m48s)

[so the window coordinates that we were](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m49s)

[given were](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m50s)

[uh they looked to be reasonable ish](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m54s)

[i don't know exactly how far over so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h06m59s)

[this is my second monitor so it's just](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m01s)

[to the right of my primary](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m03s)

[so being over 1800](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m05s)

[looks](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m10s)

[roughly what i would expect](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m15s)

[screen has a height don't laugh at me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m16s)

[that's not](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m26s)

[no device name display 2](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m28s)

[oh 1440 is its x distance over](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m32s)

[right](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m35s)

[and then it's 1920 by 1080 so the amount](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m37s)

[to move is 1080](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m39s)

[and the window bottom](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m42s)

[is](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m44s)

[956 so the amount to move would have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m45s)

[been 74 down](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m48s)

[so if i step over this](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h07m56s)

[that gets the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h08m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h08m07s)

[that gets us pretty much down by the](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h08m09s)

[bottom where we would hope](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h08m12s)

[uh coder hey just a quick sub we have](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h08m14s)

[twitch outside of that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h09m40s)

[so](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h09m42s)

[sometimes it's hard to keep up with](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h09m44s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h09m45s)

[i want to see this thing](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h10m07s)

[fail over or fall over miserably](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h10m09s)

[other ones polished up and that](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h10m41s)

[shouldn't be a big deal and i think](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h10m43s)

[having these tests in place will give me](https://youtu.be/d_WM8yqiAOI?t=02h10m45s)
