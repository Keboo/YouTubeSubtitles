[those people who are uh celebrating](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m06s)

[Christmas uh tonight going to dive back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m09s)

[into the material design in zaml Project](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m11s)

[there is a lot happening I've put off](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m14s)

[the 5 release for really bloody long](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m16s)

[time um and there's just some stuff that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m18s)

[needs to happen specifically around](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m21s)

[documentation um it came up again of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m22s)

[trying to figure out how to use stuff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m25s)

[and things weren't uh working properly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m26s)

[so I figured we yeah let's go in we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m29s)

[going to play with the new stuff rev](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m32s)

[some C 12 stuff talk about some new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m34s)

[features it'll be fun it'll be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m37s)

[fun um and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m39s)

[hopefully we'll Circle back to the brain](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m42s)

[teaser in a little bit it was one that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m44s)

[came up this last week during my day job](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m46s)

[where I made a small Boo Boo and walked](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m48s)

[right into that no reference so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m50s)

[hopefully you spotted it we'll see okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m52s)

[so material design and Amo for those](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m56s)

[people who want to follow along and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m57s)

[there is in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h00m59s)

[particular uh aside from this one um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m00s)

[Nikolai has started in on building out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m03s)

[this fairly cool split button now this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m05s)

[is something I have needed and wanted on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m08s)

[various other apps that I have built um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m11s)

[for anybody who's followed my simply](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m14s)

[budget uh project you'll know that I put](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m15s)

[together something similar to this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m18s)

[inside of that project but I did it in a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m20s)

[very user controlly way um and what this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m22s)

[quickly highlighted was the desire to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m26s)

[have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m29s)

[named color brushes so with the 50](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m30s)

[release we're doing a rename of all the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m33s)

[brushes I'm sorry there's a there's a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m35s)

[shim to make it so it doesn't suck for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m37s)

[most people um if you don't want to go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m39s)

[through and update your resource strings](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m41s)

[but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m43s)

[the the idea being that right now it can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m45s)

[be sometimes fairly difficult if you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m48s)

[want to tweak some colors inside of a a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m50s)

[template but not all and what if I want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m53s)

[to change you know the the border on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m57s)

[this half the the split button versus](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h01m59s)

[the text color are similar because right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m00s)

[now there's not a lot of uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m03s)

[individualized type control or what if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m05s)

[want to change the the color on just the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m07s)

[the back of the button rather than this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m10s)

[one that type of thing so the idea being](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m11s)

[that we want to get to a place where we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m15s)

[can do name brushes and currently that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m17s)

[doesn't work real well so we are going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m20s)

[to dive in and take a look so I was on I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m23s)

[was dealing with this stupid dependabot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m27s)

[thing that wouldn't rebase properly so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m29s)

[that's a different problem so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m31s)

[um uh Nikolai had been playing around](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m34s)

[with various brush overrides and trying](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m39s)

[to get this to work and we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m41s)

[dive in and do this and hopefully out of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m43s)

[this I Come Away with some documentation](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m45s)

[for how this brush stuff is supposed to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m48s)

[work uh and hopefully Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m50s)

[isn't just crashing on me because it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m53s)

[appears to be doing exactly that so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m54s)

[we're just going to we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h02m58s)

[hold tight real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m01s)

[exciting while it reboots and restarts I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m04s)

[installed the latest preview this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m07s)

[morning I mean what could have gone](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m08s)

[wrong right I mean how how bad could it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m10s)

[be how bad could it possibly be come on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m12s)

[Visual Studio are you going to you're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m17s)

[not going to remember what I asked you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m20s)

[to open okay try this again Visual](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m21s)

[Studio open my material design project](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m25s)

[pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m27s)

[please my calendar is reminding me that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m28s)

[I have a stream to do right now so get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m31s)

[right on that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m34s)

[part and on a happy note new Mountain](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m36s)

[Dew okay so we have this close that up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m44s)

[close that up nobody wants to see that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m49s)

[nobody wants to see that okay let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m51s)

[start with the demo app let's start with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m52s)

[let's start with the demo app and just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m55s)

[fire this guy up and we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m56s)

[close some stuff stuff I was dealing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h03m58s)

[with the auto suggest box some of the UI](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m00s)

[test were being much more finicky than I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m03s)

[would like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m07s)

[so I think they're fixed now I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m10s)

[they're fixed took a little finagling to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m13s)

[get it to play](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m15s)

[nice come on come on go ahead and launch](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m20s)

[and real quick where is this thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m23s)

[inside here so if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m26s)

[look here so here to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m28s)

[here uh it's under the buttons page got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m32s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m35s)

[wonderful let's take a look so if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m38s)

[scroll down here there we go so we've](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m41s)

[got got some color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m46s)

[overrides but not quite not quite the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m49s)

[degree that we would like Okay so let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m53s)

[take a look let's take a look in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m54s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h04m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m00s)

[so okay so here are our split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m06s)

[buttons uh and for example this one here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m10s)

[is going to be your your flat which I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m12s)

[don't know if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m15s)

[necessarily I don't know how useful the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m16s)

[flat split button is mostly because you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m19s)

[could do this today just by putting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m22s)

[these next to each other there's no real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m24s)

[UI benefit to the flat butt but we'll](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m26s)

[see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m29s)

[um there's the outline and then there's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m31s)

[just the regular one with some popup](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m33s)

[content this guy here being reused in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m36s)

[multiple](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m40s)

[places uh which is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m41s)

[great and this guy floating through here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m44s)

[so the overrides then that were done](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m47s)

[were at the very top I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m50s)

[think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m55s)

[yeah got it so we this is this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h05m58s)

[ultimately what we're looking to be able](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m02s)

[to achieve let's go look at the split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m04s)

[button do zaml because that is where it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m07s)

[the meat and potatoes actually](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m09s)

[lie split button there we go okay so we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m16s)

[have material design split button](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m21s)

[background outline border this is what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m23s)

[we would ultimately want to generate now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m26s)

[the question is in an ideal situation](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m28s)

[what we would like to see because for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m32s)

[example this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m34s)

[lives uh down here and it gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m37s)

[referenced and this guy is being picked](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m41s)

[up here and being](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m44s)

[rewired uh from Key](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m48s)

[primary I'm wondering if this is right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m52s)

[or if this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m54s)

[backwards feels a little backwards to me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h06m58s)

[so let's let's let's pret well one let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m03s)

[get these things generating first of all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m07s)

[so inside of the material design project](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m09s)

[there's a an MD resource](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m12s)

[gen project and this guy here assuming I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m14s)

[left it set up properly has various](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m18s)

[profiles for generating out stuff and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m21s)

[specifically this generate theming is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m24s)

[the one that we're interested in so when](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m26s)

[this guy runs he goes through and this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m29s)

[is one of the big changes in 5o](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m32s)

[generates out all of the various theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m34s)

[brushes uh and related stuff that we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m37s)

[might need uh and his input for this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m40s)

[comes from right here now the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m44s)

[limiting factor here is these light and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m47s)

[dark themed](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m50s)

[colors uh are only being leveraged for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m51s)

[very specific use cases they aren't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h07m56s)

[they aren't forwarding across so one of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m00s)

[the things that this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m02s)

[generates is down is it no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m04s)

[it's where is it actually you know what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m08s)

[we're just going to do this and I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m12s)

[going to run](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m14s)

[it and then that will that will show all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m16s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m19s)

[things we go and look now few](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m20s)

[changes so for example we've got a new a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m25s)

[new thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m29s)

[here uh you'll see that it's edited the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m31s)

[the light resource theme it's edited](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m34s)

[this thing here uh and built those](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m36s)

[across which is fine that's kind of what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m39s)

[we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m41s)

[expect um but this ends up not properly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m42s)

[forwarding now in an ideal situation](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m46s)

[what we would like from this split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m49s)

[button situation is we would like to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m52s)

[have something of this nature I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m54s)

[what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m57s)

[let's just come down here and create a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h08m59s)

[new new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m01s)

[element we may want to we may want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m03s)

[put together a like a Json schema or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m06s)

[something for this so that it plays a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m08s)

[little nicer okay so I go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m10s)

[there there split button background okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m13s)

[and then it's going to have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m17s)

[no no obsolete Keys No alternate keys](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m19s)

[and we want it to point](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m23s)

[at ideally this is what is the ideal](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m26s)

[brush that we want so with nothing with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m33s)

[nothing changing this is what we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m36s)

[looking for so if we rerun](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m38s)

[this uh and actually I want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m40s)

[fast](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h09m58s)

[okay so now you see we've got a ton of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m01s)

[stuff so it's built out uh whole classes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m03s)

[for being able to generate these it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m08s)

[populated both the light and the Dark](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m10s)

[theme stuff it's generated a split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m11s)

[buttons class inside of my theme so I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m14s)

[have split button. color which is great](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m16s)

[that way you can set this up uh in color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m19s)

[just need to be a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m38s)

[rethink that goes on here because before](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m40s)

[all of these theme brushes weren't tied](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m42s)

[to the the color theme they were tied to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m45s)

[the base theme colors and this this here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m49s)

[is where the problem ultimately lies](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m51s)

[because oh that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m54s)

[mistake static](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h10m57s)

[necessarily coming](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m10s)

[across uh let's see so set light](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m12s)

[theme and I think it just needs to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m19s)

[smart enough to know that this is the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m22s)

[primary the problem is is this assumes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m25s)

[that it can pull from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m27s)

[this assumes that it can set this up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m32s)

[from just the base theme without](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m37s)

[changing without respect to the color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m40s)

[theme because this is kind of the issue](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m43s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m45s)

[is you can have your base theme of light](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m46s)

[or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m50s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m52s)

[however in this case if you want the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m54s)

[theme to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h11m58s)

[be one of the color themes that's just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m00s)

[not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m03s)

[here and should it be is really the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m04s)

[question because this seems](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m08s)

[like there's not a good answer here as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m12s)

[far as what this should do this only has](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m15s)

[five references and I imagine most of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m17s)

[them are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m19s)

[tests yeah so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m23s)

[two two usages there and there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m25s)

[okay so set base](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m33s)

[theme and I think what we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m37s)

[want I think what we really want this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m46s)

[thing thing to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m48s)

[is this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h12m51s)

[actually what we want this thing to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m02s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m04s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m11s)

[as is that the right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m13s)

[choice is that the right choice because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m17s)

[that does assume a bit of order of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m19s)

[operations here as far as when the base](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m21s)

[theme gets called](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m23s)

[because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m27s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m32s)

[here why does adjust colors not handle](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m38s)

[the other ones has no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m41s)

[usages I'm G to find all kinds of bugs](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m44s)

[in here tonight I can just see it now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m46s)

[it's going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m48s)

[great](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h13m57s)

[I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m02s)

[wondering I'm kind of wondering if the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m11s)

[if the actual method here shouldn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m14s)

[be set light Set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m17s)

[Dark I'm kind of wondering if a better a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m25s)

[a better idea here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m29s)

[is oh man it's it's really it's really](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m35s)

[tough to know what the right API is so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m38s)

[here's my thinking I'm thinking it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m40s)

[something along the lines of this public](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m41s)

[static void set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m43s)

[theme this theme theme right and then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m46s)

[something where](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m50s)

[it's okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m52s)

[stupid co-pilot I mean it's not wrong](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h14m59s)

[but it's it's still a bloody](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m02s)

[showoff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m03s)

[um and I don't think I would default](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m07s)

[it and so the key part here is the order](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m12s)

[of operations of when when things get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m15s)

[set is that confusing to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m18s)

[people is that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m21s)

[confusing because the risk factor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m24s)

[is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m27s)

[the the risk factor here is this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m35s)

[is oh you know what we could do you know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m41s)

[what we could do theme doesn't have to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m44s)

[be built the way that it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h15m47s)

[colors and then for example the split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m19s)

[button it generated a class and inside](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m23s)

[it makes is it fairly nice when you want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m28s)

[to when you want to go through and set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m30s)

[something slightly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m42s)

[nicer so here's here's the crazy here's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m45s)

[the crazy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h17m57s)

[um struct or class let's do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h18m01s)

[class we do something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h18m06s)

[this actually could we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h18m11s)

[do well okay so so here's the idea all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h18m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h18m19s)

[we only have these theme colors here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m00s)

[right and I I'm imagining something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m04s)

[actually here copilot I'll give you a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m08s)

[I almost had to write code for this um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m31s)

[okay now do the Constructor for me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m35s)

[that's wrong co-pilot you suck](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m37s)

[see ref and then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m41s)

[we'll uh oh ref is a keyword uh shut up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m45s)

[I don't want to think too hard real real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m50s)

[something something to this this effect](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h19m54s)

[se I mean they're they're certainly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m05s)

[helpful uh there because then what we we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m12s)

[could do is so for example we have this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m16s)

[color ref test color right we're going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m20s)

[to have we're going to have something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m24s)

[something to this effect](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m26s)

[um and this is part of why I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m29s)

[if maybe it makes sense to make this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m31s)

[a record](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m35s)

[struct something to that effect because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m41s)

[uh then our usage up here can be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m45s)

[something like theme. test color gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m47s)

[colors.](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m51s)

[red and that works theme. test color get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m53s)

[get uh ref. primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h21m58s)

[light right and then we we come down](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m02s)

[here and we say hey co-pilot I want I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m05s)

[want one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m07s)

[more see you suck co-pilot I'm still the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m08s)

[developer darn](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m12s)

[it um and then we do something like this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m14s)

[where we go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m16s)

[ref](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m18s)

[ref like this right so now now now this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m23s)

[code works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m27s)

[here I'm just wondering](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m34s)

[then that does mean if somebody pulls](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m37s)

[this theme instance and goes test color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m39s)

[you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m42s)

[know what I would really like to get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m44s)

[back is the value of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m47s)

[primary light right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m50s)

[there and we can do some funky stuff in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m55s)

[here um convert to full](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h22m59s)

[property right now I'm just trying to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m03s)

[figure out how to implement this and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m05s)

[then we'll go edit the the generator so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m07s)

[that it works so we do something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m10s)

[this that goes in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m19s)

[there and we make this thing read only](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m24s)

[because mutable structs are a recipe for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m27s)

[disaster oh yeah we definitely want you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m30s)

[to be a readon struct pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m32s)

[please uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m36s)

[use sure flatten everything up for me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m39s)

[make it make it pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m41s)

[okay because we know when this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m47s)

[assignment here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m49s)

[occurs and so we would know when](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h23m56s)

[that's not bad](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m00s)

[co-pilot it's not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m03s)

[bad I mean you're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m07s)

[wrong but you're you're getting the idea](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m09s)

[co-pilot you're getting the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m12s)

[idea and actually maybe we don't do it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m20s)

[on the setter maybe we do it on the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m23s)

[getter right so we go here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m25s)

[and we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m33s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m35s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m38s)

[if testc color.](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m40s)

[ref](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m47s)

[uh hang on hang on hang on we might we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m50s)

[might be on to something here uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m53s)

[see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m56s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h24m59s)

[value right uh and then we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m01s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m06s)

[color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m08s)

[color um okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m13s)

[otherwise](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m26s)

[this is this is jumping straight](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m28s)

[into](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m32s)

[that which isn't quite what we want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m35s)

[because we probably want to maintain the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m37s)

[ref do we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m41s)

[care probably we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m44s)

[do we probably](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m46s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m49s)

[um because this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m56s)

[is passing in and hitting the so what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h25m59s)

[this is doing here is this is hitting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m02s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m04s)

[um uh the the conversion from color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m07s)

[back and what we probably want to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m13s)

[instead we could actually probably](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m20s)

[change this up okay copilot you did such](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m22s)

[a good job I'm going to throw away all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m24s)

[your code so what if we did switch uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m26s)

[test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m30s)

[color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m32s)

[ref and actually I guess we could just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m34s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m37s)

[return uh test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m38s)

[color we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m42s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m47s)

[right and we can do the else case](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m52s)

[first](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h26m56s)

[uh let's see what have I done wrong uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m02s)

[ex Hey Izzy thank you for the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m09s)

[sub I appreciate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m13s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m17s)

[uh why can I not do a switch](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m20s)

[expression what am I doing wrong](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m22s)

[here do undo undo undo](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m26s)

[undo thing switch oh I'm an idiot and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m29s)

[put a Lambda](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m33s)

[in don't put a Lambda in there problem](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m35s)

[solved okay so default case is there but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m38s)

[if we have ref say primary mid or we'll](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m41s)

[we'll start with secondary light right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m46s)

[this guy comes in here and we do new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m48s)

[color ref and we probably want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m50s)

[uh secondary light. color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h27m54s)

[but I'm also thinking that maybe what we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m02s)

[do is we do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m04s)

[a like this that way we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m09s)

[uh like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m15s)

[that is that a bad idea it's kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m20s)

[sucky if every property has to do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m23s)

[lookup](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m26s)

[but these lookups only occur once and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m31s)

[then it allows the theme to be mutated](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m34s)

[in any number of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m37s)

[ways and then it means that our](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m40s)

[generator inside of here where our](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m44s)

[ugliness](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m47s)

[is if this background property were a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m51s)

[color ref instead rather than a color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h28m53s)

[kind of like this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m01s)

[idea not sure I really like it but I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m03s)

[kind of like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m06s)

[it okay let's let's flush this out a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m12s)

[little](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m14s)

[more we've proven that it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m15s)

[compiles like that's that's a step in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m17s)

[the right direction](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m21s)

[now could we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m24s)

[Dodge this whole enu](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m28s)

[garbage kind of my next](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m31s)

[thought could we Dodge the en because it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m41s)

[would be nice if I didn't have to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m44s)

[this that would be an ideal](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m46s)

[situation but I need to store something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m52s)

[where maybe it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h29m59s)

[required but can I avoid exposing it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m02s)

[really the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m06s)

[and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m28s)

[then and then hide](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m30s)

[it because this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m36s)

[immutable we could do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m39s)

[right think we can get I I I think we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m46s)

[can get away with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m50s)

[uh secondary light](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m54s)

[and just do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h30m58s)

[that I think we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m00s)

[this this becomes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m03s)

[private we do that what's your problem](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m08s)

[here ambiguity between color ref and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m13s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m26s)

[private](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m39s)

[you probably don't need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m41s)

[exist that gets us to there because now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m46s)

[we can have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m49s)

[this and then we could do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m54s)

[this and I think then I can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h31m57s)

[do color reference secondary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h32m00s)

[like that as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h32m27s)

[much because I've been trying like I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h32m37s)

[always hate when people make things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h32m39s)

[annoying but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h32m55s)

[but there needs to be a match here if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m01s)

[did do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m05s)

[this that can go back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m08s)

[there theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m11s)

[me from putting this back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m22s)

[now it just needs to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m25s)

[and then obviously the implementation](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m29s)

[needs to not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m31s)

[suck](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m33s)

[um and then we're kind of back where we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m40s)

[were but and all we've done is really](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m43s)

[Nest an enum and make it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h33m45s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h34m19s)

[that how bad is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h34m20s)

[work now if we forced people into](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h34m51s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h34m54s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h34m55s)

[that works I guess](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h34m59s)

[then because and so let me phrase set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m01s)

[light or set base theme is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m05s)

[is kind of where it comes down to but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m07s)

[set base theme call set light set dark](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m10s)

[but the issue here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m13s)

[is if because these are autogenerated](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m14s)

[for set light and Set Dark if this call](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m17s)

[here needs to look look out and and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m20s)

[instead of this be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m24s)

[this uh or I'm sorry theme dot primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m30s)

[mid.](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m35s)

[color right the problem comes is if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m36s)

[somebody changes primary primary mid](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m39s)

[after the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m42s)

[fact because then this helper method](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m50s)

[doesn't quite do what they](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m52s)

[expect I'm wondering how bad of an idea](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m55s)

[that is is to take](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h35m58s)

[away because if you call something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m00s)

[set primary color but then don't recall](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m03s)

[set base](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m05s)

[theme doesn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m07s)

[apply boy I'm wondering if I should take](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m12s)

[away the ability for doing that or if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m15s)

[should have the base theme have a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m18s)

[different or make all of the properties](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m21s)

[not be normal properties anymore and be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m23s)

[something slightly different than just a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m27s)

[basic](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m29s)

[color what's the disadvantages of each](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m31s)

[okay if we change the property off of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m34s)

[the type of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m36s)

[color serialization could potentially be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m37s)

[an issue for somebody if somebody wants](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m41s)

[to try to serialize this theme class and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m42s)

[I kind of liked it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m45s)

[being a Poco however you probably](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m47s)

[shouldn't serialize this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m52s)

[class because any updates to the library](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m55s)

[could add more properties to this and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h36m58s)

[your serialization would then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m02s)

[fail so it's better to not be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m05s)

[serializing so that's not that big of a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m07s)

[negative](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m11s)

[okay uh other disadvantage of changing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m13s)

[the type is that the properties are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m16s)

[going to be arguably slower there's now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m19s)

[a switch expression on every single](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m21s)

[property](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m23s)

[access](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m25s)

[how B big of an issue is that that could](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m28s)

[be an issue when applying a theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m31s)

[because to apply a theme it has to go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m35s)

[through and access all of those](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m37s)

[properties we could have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m48s)

[it not do the lookup](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m53s)

[of the color on the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h37m59s)

[getter that's an interesting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m03s)

[idea that's an interesting idea so what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m06s)

[if what if okay so back to this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m09s)

[idea right so what if it didn't do the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m12s)

[lookup on the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m15s)

[getter right so rather than doing this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m17s)

[lookup](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m20s)

[here we just leave this guy as is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m22s)

[well but if we don't do the lookup on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m27s)

[the getter people can't use the implicit](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m29s)

[conversion to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m31s)

[color it means this line of code doesn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m35s)

[work that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m45s)

[interesting that is interesting is I and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m53s)

[I kind of want that to work because I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h38m58s)

[people expect to be able to pull that up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m00s)

[and look at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m02s)

[it I mean the pros of doing this are we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m06s)

[can get this kind of syntax to work](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m09s)

[which is pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m11s)

[slick pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m16s)

[slick I think what we probably do though](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m19s)

[is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m22s)

[we pull this sucker out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m23s)

[we probably make this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m26s)

[public we leave this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m31s)

[off I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m34s)

[think yeah and we kind of make we we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m45s)

[expect people to rather than doing this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m49s)

[we expect them to go color reference you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m51s)

[know secondary light and maybe we move](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m54s)

[these properties to a different class](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m56s)

[where it's you you type like theme color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h39m58s)

[reference or whatever right like that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m00s)

[that's an easy thing to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m02s)

[um keeping it all in one place isn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m05s)

[that bad either so if we do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m07s)

[that this is Con This is highly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m15s)

[convenient](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m25s)

[can I do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m27s)

[a I could do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m34s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h40m55s)

[we could do we could do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m00s)

[this that eliminates](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m02s)

[this at this point there's no reason to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m07s)

[have it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m09s)

[internal](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m10s)

[um and then at this point this thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m14s)

[just well this is only expected to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m16s)

[called from here so we can actually just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m20s)

[do it right here theme ref refence uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m23s)

[none and do it that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m27s)

[way um and then this doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m31s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m36s)

[anymore uh and then this can be colors](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m38s)

[dot there isn't a none](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m43s)

[here do that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m47s)

[though what should do uh would a to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m49s)

[useful on getter value trigger only](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m53s)

[determine the the trigger CH the value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m55s)

[set that's an interesting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h41m57s)

[idea because that is that is an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m05s)

[interesting Oh that's oh so this doesn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m11s)

[work now either does](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m14s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m19s)

[um uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m25s)

[uh that goes like that that goes like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m29s)

[that that goes like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m32s)

[that this becomes this becomes more like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m36s)

[this I don't know if I like the idea of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m47s)

[a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m50s)

[tuple the the the big disadvantage there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m50s)

[is value Tuple inside of.net is mutable](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m55s)

[and I very much want this read only](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h42m58s)

[because part of how this works is it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m01s)

[getting it's it's abusing the fact that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m03s)

[it knows that between the setter and the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m06s)

[getter no one can mutate this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m08s)

[reference right if I try to do something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m11s)

[like uh test color. color gets colors](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m15s)

[red right no worky which is which is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m20s)

[highly convenient here I'm just really](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m24s)

[wondering if I want to end up with this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m26s)

[kind of switch expression in every](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m28s)

[single property](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m31s)

[getter I mean we we we can we can burn](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m34s)

[some of this down um a little bit and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m37s)

[and have some helper methods right like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m40s)

[we could do you know uh private color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m43s)

[reference uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m48s)

[resolve all right and then we move this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m50s)

[whole thing into here and goes here here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m53s)

[and we go with color reference uh color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h43m56s)

[reference and we we do we do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m00s)

[maneuver uh let's see boom](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m04s)

[boom and then this the the getter now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m08s)

[become](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m11s)

[simpler right we have something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m13s)

[resolve test color but I I don't know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m17s)

[like this gets us back down to to simple](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m21s)

[looking properties](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m23s)

[but yeah hidden trigger property that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m25s)

[that's kind of the idea because what I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m28s)

[really would like to see like I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m31s)

[be able to have a property on the theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m34s)

[that is either an explicit](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m37s)

[color or a reference to another](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m39s)

[color and I I think the only two options](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m45s)

[available to me are I Chang the type and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m48s)

[we kind of already have some precedence](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m51s)

[for changing the type because we've got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m53s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m56s)

[here this color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h44m58s)

[pair and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m02s)

[actually while I'm in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m08s)

[here we're going to change a bunch of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m11s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m13s)

[uh we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m17s)

[this um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m24s)

[and you now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m32s)

[go you go away this becomes a this color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m34s)

[null and you go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m41s)

[away that I think makes my life](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m48s)

[easier](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m54s)

[aside from the fact that uh primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h45m59s)

[Constructors aren't available in C 11 so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m01s)

[let's talk C](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m04s)

[12 uh where I think I have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m07s)

[a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m12s)

[uh build props langing version I heard](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m14s)

[langing version 12 let's use the new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m18s)

[stuff so something worth noting with net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m20s)

[8 dropping in general you don't like you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m23s)

[don't have to rev up your libraries to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m27s)

[net 8 if you don't want to now if you're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m30s)

[building an app you probably want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m32s)

[from the standpoint of there's some](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m35s)

[nice uh like performance benefits and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m37s)

[whatnot that come in just by revving](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m40s)

[your app to net 8 and if you've already](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m42s)

[been on Net 7 change the seven to an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m45s)

[eight and you're Off to the Races](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m47s)

[there's very like here real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m49s)

[quick uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m51s)

[bum breaking Chang is in net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m53s)

[a so let's real quick there are like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h46m59s)

[very very few so one it's worth noting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h47m03s)

[what specific area that you're talking](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h47m06s)

[about you'll note WPF doesn't show up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h47m09s)

[because there are none right so if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h47m12s)

[look at like uh core.net libraries of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h47m15s)

[pick on a few things but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h48m22s)

[like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h48m24s)

[these these types of things is very very](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h48m26s)

[building an app uh revving to net 8 is a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m03s)

[um the latest C goodness now there's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m16s)

[updates um but little things like I want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m23s)

[the primary Constructor feature turn it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m26s)

[up uh let's see long toone no see thanks](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m29s)

[for I Ed it back around the time you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m31s)

[stories okay so we're going to we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m48s)

[going to compile real quick just to just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m50s)

[to make sure we're still in the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m52s)

[compiling State the other thing that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m53s)

[you'll note is is this demo this demo](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m55s)

[project like this is how we can verify](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h49m57s)

[that we haven't broken bat compat anyway](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m01s)

[is we're still compiling against](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m03s)

[framework net 6 Net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m06s)

[be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m11s)

[breaking uh color pair does not contain](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m12s)

[a definition for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m15s)

[color well that just doesn't sound right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m17s)

[this is the part where I discover that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m19s)

[primary Constructors aren't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m21s)

[available](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m26s)

[uh uh or the oh I bet you it's different](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m29s)

[on the hang on hang on we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m33s)

[check one thing real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m34s)

[quick so specifically what I am looking](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m38s)

[at this right here when you multi-target](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m42s)

[it's important to note that sometimes a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m46s)

[build a is only for a particular Target](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m47s)

[so for example an easy way to kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m50s)

[test and see if this is tied to do a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m52s)

[particular build is you can change up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m55s)

[here which which of your target](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h50m57s)

[Frameworks you want to actually be going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m00s)

[against um and I think I think in this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m03s)

[case because primary Constructors what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m05s)

[they do is they generate a a field](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m09s)

[behind the scenes um that you then have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m12s)

[to go and expose which that's fine I we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m15s)

[we can do this so um I believe the Ida](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m19s)

[here is public color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m22s)

[color uh parameter color is unread I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m31s)

[trying to remember okay new syntax uh C](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m34s)

[12 primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m39s)

[Constructors let's go take a look](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m42s)

[because new stuff new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m44s)

[syntax uh yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m48s)

[hush okay so oh that's right so the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m52s)

[issue is is I have named these things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m55s)

[like that and I need to name them like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h51m58s)

[that that way there's no longer any](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m02s)

[ambiguity problem solved so this is one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m08s)

[of those areas where the the net team](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m10s)

[has conveniently added a feature and has](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m14s)

[screwed up people's naming conventions](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m16s)

[because oftentimes people have a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m19s)

[different naming convention for their](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m20s)

[backing Fields as they do their uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m22s)

[Constructor parameters for example if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m26s)

[do a this dot here um we will find well](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m28s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m33s)

[uh public void](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m35s)

[Fu right so if we come in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m40s)

[here oh interesting it's hidden it away](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m43s)

[from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m45s)

[me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m47s)

[oh I am lying to people hang on what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m49s)

[happens if I do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m52s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h52m54s)

[no no no no no no I'm thinking this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m03s)

[an intellisense](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m06s)

[issue okay what am I missing what am I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m15s)

[missing let's see public read only](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m18s)

[struck uh let's see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m22s)

[initializes two readon properties that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m26s)

[are computed from primary Constructor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m28s)

[parameters let's see primary Constructor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m32s)

[parameters may not be stored if they](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m34s)

[aren't needed aren't they aren't members](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m36s)

[of the class oh that's what I'm doing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m40s)

[stupid and can't be accessed with this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m42s)

[dot got it that's why I'm being stupid](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m46s)

[so I did have it right okay I don't know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m50s)

[if that was true in all instances](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m53s)

[of I don't I feel like I was playing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m57s)

[with preview versions of net 8 where](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h53m59s)

[that wasn't necessarily always true and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m02s)

[they were accessible inside of other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m04s)

[methods which was weird but okay that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m08s)

[should get us back into a complient](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m13s)

[state crossing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m15s)

[fingers and I realize I am poo on a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m17s)

[branch but at some point we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m19s)

[uh okay so we got a couple airs but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m22s)

[there are all off in let me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m25s)

[scroll uh external in nit is not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m28s)

[defined oh um I would like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m32s)

[to uh actually I think we can do it this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m39s)

[way so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m42s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m45s)

[isal in it this guy so this is the this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m47s)

[is a magical attribute that allows](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m52s)

[things like um init properties so rather](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m55s)

[than get set get init because what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h54m58s)

[actually happens behind the scenes is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m01s)

[when you declare a property with init](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m03s)

[rather than a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m05s)

[set there's still a property getter and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m06s)

[a property Setter behind the scenes but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m09s)

[when you invoke a um a method in C](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m12s)

[there's this optional thing that can go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m16s)

[along called modre m o d r e q and it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m18s)

[requires the callor have an attribute on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m23s)

[the invocation in order for it to work](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m26s)

[now there's no C Syntax for doing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m29s)

[this but it's how several C features are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m33s)

[implemented so in order for a caller to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m36s)

[call the init Setter it has to have that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m39s)

[attribute tacked on the way that ends up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m43s)

[functionally being implemented is the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m46s)

[compiler then only will tack that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m48s)

[attribute onto invocations that assigned](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m50s)

[to this property that are inside of an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m53s)

[initializer guaranteeing that that uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m57s)

[ends up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h55m59s)

[working now it's also how you get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m01s)

[backwards compatibility and why getting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m03s)

[it works with serializers because things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m05s)

[like reflection don't care about that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m08s)

[and you can just reflect straight on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m11s)

[this property pull it Setter out and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m13s)

[invoke it it's perfectly fine with that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m15s)

[which means if people have serialization](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m18s)

[code it works just fine it also means](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m20s)

[that um older code because it's um being](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m24s)

[enforced by the compiler if you have an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m28s)

[old enough compiler that doesn't know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m31s)

[anything about the the modre it'll also](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m33s)

[work so you get backwards compatibility](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m37s)

[so it's it's a very interesting and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m39s)

[clever way of getting around things it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m42s)

[also means you can blatantly cheat so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m44s)

[for example the issue being right now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m47s)

[that it's squawking](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m49s)

[at um we're going to comment this one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m52s)

[out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m54s)

[um just let's get ourselves down](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m55s)

[to uh comment this let's get ourselves](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h56m59s)

[down to just the one air and then we'll](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m03s)

[we'll deal with it so here's how you can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m05s)

[do it in older.](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m08s)

[net so this should think this guy should](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m10s)

[go through and give me the same air](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m13s)

[about external](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m15s)

[init yeah so it's it's now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m17s)

[unhappy because I've I've done this and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m21s)

[it's like hang on I I need to be able to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m24s)

[generate an init property but that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m27s)

[doesn't exist and the key thing here to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m31s)

[note is it doesn't exist but only for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m33s)

[myet 462 Target right so it's an error](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m36s)

[there if I change this to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m40s)

[462 now I get my red squigglies if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m43s)

[look at net six or net or net s I'm fine](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m47s)

[because that attribute is declared in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m52s)

[inside of the Base Class](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m54s)

[libraries](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m57s)

[so dirty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h57m59s)

[trick you come over here and you go hey](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m01s)

[I would really like the external init](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m04s)

[attribute that the compiler is looking](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m06s)

[for so if anybody wants it it's right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m08s)

[there um actually this is a weird place](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m12s)

[for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m15s)

[it um just bump everyone off the lower](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m16s)

[versions if only that were an option um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m19s)

[and what we will do we will come over](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m22s)

[here and we are going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m26s)

[go um trying to think of where the right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m30s)

[place is to put](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m34s)

[this we're going to put it we're going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m38s)

[to make a new file and then we're going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m41s)

[to immediately move it because where I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m42s)

[want to put it isn't inside of a project](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m44s)

[wait this is such a hack no no no this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m47s)

[is this is abusing the duct typing that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m50s)

[is in the compiler](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m53s)

[uh so magic magic occurs here so we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h58m59s)

[going to put this guy in and then we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m03s)

[going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m05s)

[to uh pound](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m07s)

[if uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m10s)

[net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m12s)

[uh let's see I want net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m18s)

[462 because that's the only target I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m21s)

[want this to clar in and we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m23s)

[go end if and then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m26s)

[here and we're going to open the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m27s)

[containing folder and we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m28s)

[take it right on out of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m30s)

[project I'm trying to decide where a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m34s)

[good common place is we don't have a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m36s)

[good place for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m38s)

[this uh we're going to make a new folder](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m45s)

[because I don't see a good place for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m47s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m49s)

[shims](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m51s)

[paste and then what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m53s)

[here is we're going to go because I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m56s)

[suspect I may want this in multiple](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=00h59m58s)

[places existing item and we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m00s)

[go up a layer into our shims highlight](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m04s)

[and then since we're talking about split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m08s)

[buttons hit the drop down on your split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m11s)

[button add his](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m13s)

[link okay now we come over here and it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m17s)

[happy the compiler is happy for 4](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m21s)

[62 we now have an it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m25s)

[huzzah so because the compiler is like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m30s)

[well I need to know about this attribute](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m34s)

[that attribute doesn't exist in any](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m37s)

[referenced assembly we can go I got you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m39s)

[compiler let me let me let me insert](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m41s)

[that attribute for you and because it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m44s)

[matches the right name space and type](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m45s)

[name it's perfectly happy to use](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m48s)

[it so there's a number of features like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m51s)

[this that you you can effectively back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m53s)

[compat your way in by shimming it and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m56s)

[believe I've seen people put nougat](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h00m59s)

[packages together with similar things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m01s)

[bundled into them just to shim your way](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m04s)

[into happiness so that you don't have to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m06s)

[think too hard I don't like taking an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m09s)

[extra Nate dependency inside of a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m11s)

[library inside of an app totally](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m12s)

[fine totally fine uh just vet your Nate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m15s)

[packages like normal due diligence stuff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m18s)

[okay I think I'm landing on doing some](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m22s)

[sort of garbage like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m26s)

[this uh so you could do this with like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m29s)

[the nullability well so I'll clarify you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m31s)

[can do this with some features not all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m34s)

[um nullability is kind of a different](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m37s)

[animal because there's nothing in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m39s)

[there's nothing in the Base Class](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m43s)

[library that enables or disables it it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m44s)

[all compiler analysis so you kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m47s)

[have to have the newer compiler and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m51s)

[again this is the idea is newer compiler](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m53s)

[targeting older framework wanting to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m56s)

[leverage newer compiler](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h01m59s)

[features you can make them](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m02s)

[work so it's it's only because the net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m07s)

[team obviously can't go and add that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m11s)

[attribute back into net 462 that's not a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m13s)

[thing that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m16s)

[possible but you can add it into your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m17s)

[library or your app and and reenable it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m19s)

[because nothing net 4x2 is going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m23s)

[using an init keyword it didn't exist](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m25s)

[when it was released that's not a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m28s)

[thing but because your library does](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m32s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m35s)

[now we can be Off to the Races so we can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m36s)

[get our primary Constructors in and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m40s)

[working](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m43s)

[huzzah do we like this is this a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m45s)

[reasonable way of dealing with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m48s)

[it it doesn't seem that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m53s)

[bad and this is all new apis just to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h02m59s)

[clear this is completely new apis so the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m03s)

[theme class is new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m06s)

[apis all of this color stuff in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m08s)

[generation brand new apis inside of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m10s)

[01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:19,119](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m13s)

project and it's unreleased which means

[if we're going to do something we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m17s)

[it now and I don't have to worry about](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m19s)

[breaking changes because this is already](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m20s)

[break like brand new API as far as I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m22s)

[concerned unreleased outside of preview](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m26s)

[packages I kind of like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m30s)

[this it also leaves a nice door open if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m32s)

[we want to add anything additional I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m35s)

[know there's some material design](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m37s)

[libraries also add a tertiary color as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m40s)

[well in addition to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m43s)

[secondary I've resisted adding it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m44s)

[because all that's going to do is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m47s)

[bloat I like it we're shipping it we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m51s)

[doing it this we're doing it we're doing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m53s)

[it we're doing it we're doing it okay so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m55s)

[step one let's get off of nikolai's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h03m57s)

[feature](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m00s)

[Branch why stop with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m01s)

[tary because you got to draw a line](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m03s)

[somewhere uh create Branch here let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m06s)

[see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m09s)

[uh more color updates](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m10s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m15s)

[okay and then I do want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m17s)

[add those we did switch branches all the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m21s)

[way way right good cool I'm just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m24s)

[surprised it did it so cleanly um I do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m27s)

[want to make sure that our like our](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m29s)

[library doesn't necessarily need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m33s)

[Target net 8 yet but I am going to make](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m34s)

[it I'm going to make sure that our demo](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m38s)

[apps are targeting net 8 and actually](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m41s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m43s)

[what what's end of life on these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m44s)

[things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m49s)

[net okay because I have a rule that I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m53s)

[don't support any version of net once it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m56s)

[drops end of support so in case you're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h04m58s)

[wondering how long the material design](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m01s)

[library is going to support net 6 Net 7](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m03s)

[net 8 here's your list of dates right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m05s)

[here I will I will commit to supporting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m08s)

[it as long as Microsoft supports that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m10s)

[version ofet after that you can assume](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m12s)

[that I'm dropping](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m15s)

[support](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m16s)

[um so net s is still till May of next](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m19s)

[year okay so we'll leave we leave it all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m22s)

[in for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m24s)

[now but short version net 6 and Net 7](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m26s)

[both die next year](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m29s)

[so you should you should look at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m31s)

[Alternatives definitely look at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m36s)

[Alternatives and this is this is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m38s)

[to break the pipeline and everything and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m40s)

[all the stuff because why not and like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m42s)

[if we're going to break something we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m44s)

[going to do it I don't do it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m45s)

[halfway](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m47s)

[um Okay so so there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m52s)

[there's that okay demo apps are all revv](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m55s)

[to net 8 because why](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m57s)

[not um okay so we want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h05m59s)

[do uh is it worth bringing out the tfms](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m06s)

[to a shared props file](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m11s)

[not not yet only because the the top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m15s)

[level structure of these CS prodes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m18s)

[there's not a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m21s)

[all of the projects are one level down](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m24s)

[from the rout of the repo there's not a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m26s)

[way for me to combine the tfms for just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m29s)

[the demo projects without doing some Ms](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m33s)

[build](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m35s)

[hackery um compared to the other ones so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m36s)

[I think I leave them in here for now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m39s)

[because at present I am revving these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m41s)

[independently and I don't want all of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m44s)

[them targeting like for example you'll](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m46s)

[note the UI tests are already up on net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m50s)

[01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:00,640](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m53s)

but I I don't and in fact and for

[example the WPF tests are running](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h06m59s)

[against 472 instead of 462](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m00s)

[so I don't actually have common tfms](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m04s)

[across all my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m07s)

[projects so I think that I think to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m09s)

[it I would have to change the the folder](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m12s)

[hierarchy to give myself a a better way](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m15s)

[of doing it so for now we just rev that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m18s)

[um okay so step one reference we like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m22s)

[this is obviously needs to be renamed](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m25s)

[from ref to reference to no let's call](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m28s)

[this theme reference we want to be and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m31s)

[we want this to be like this we want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m34s)

[this to be like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h07m38s)

[really trying to prove your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m07s)

[worth um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m09s)

[okay we do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m11s)

[this we do this right and we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m13s)

[obviously going to write some tests on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m17s)

[this to make sure that this works the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m18s)

[way we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m20s)

[expect and by write some tests we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m21s)

[going to write a template into the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m24s)

[generator that's going to write the test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m25s)

[for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m27s)

[me because yes I am that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m29s)

[lazy okay but I think the key thing here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m33s)

[is I want all of this Co like I want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m36s)

[this much of the code to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m39s)

[work um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m42s)

[now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m45s)

[this oh I broke this hey co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m50s)

[implement it for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m54s)

[me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h08m58s)

[uh no that is not right uh public stat](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m00s)

[uh oh actually hang on hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m06s)

[we're going to try something uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m07s)

[see what is it it's alt period control](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m10s)

[period nope Windows period one of dang](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m13s)

[it one of you is the the T toal alt](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m16s)

[slash how silly of me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m19s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m22s)

[thank you Benjamin uh implicit](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m24s)

[conversion to color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m29s)

[go now could I have typed it in this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m32s)

[amount of time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m34s)

[absolutely I just no co-pilot co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m41s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m45s)

[co-pilot uh no absolutely](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m47s)

[not I think you be dumb](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m51s)

[uh and I can only emphasize that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h09m55s)

[strongly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m12s)

[oh color. color and it's going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m14s)

[be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m19s)

[uh makes me think they're giving it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m21s)

[still not so great at all but hopefully](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m26s)

[it improves it it it's actually the so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m27s)

[the chat on the side in my opinion](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m31s)

[worthless the chat inside of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m33s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m35s)

[window mildly better still pretty much](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m36s)

[worthless the inline chat uh is actually](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m39s)

[remarkable so when I was at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m44s)

[ignite we we wrote the entire game of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m47s)

[pong and python five of us who know no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m50s)

[Python and we did it without actually](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m54s)

[writing a line of python we did it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m56s)

[entirely with co-pilot inline](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h10m58s)

[chat now occasionally we had to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m01s)

[things like this where we would select](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m04s)

[it and go uh you know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m05s)

[explain this right and so when you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m09s)

[select text you can feed it better](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m13s)

[context um and get better information](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m16s)

[out of it so in that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m19s)

[regard being able to just tell it the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m22s)

[context because there was a number of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m25s)

[times where without giving it any](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m27s)

[context it was garbage like it doesn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m29s)

[have the like it's not quite as good as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m33s)

[a human that kind of can implicitly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m35s)

[follow a train of thought you have to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m37s)

[say this thing here see this it's like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m40s)

[you grab the head point at it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m42s)

[look that's the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m44s)

[thing uh is rarely even line for me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m50s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m54s)

[cool yeah yeah and it's not it's not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h11m57s)

[necessarily guaranteed in all cases](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m00s)

[but um and I'm thinking this should](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m03s)

[probably just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m06s)

[throw throw](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m08s)

[new uh invalid operation](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m11s)

[exception and we're going to do we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m15s)

[going to try to be useful](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m17s)

[um Let's do let's do something more like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m23s)

[uh let's see name](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m24s)

[of color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m26s)

[reference uh does](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m30s)

[not oh does not uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m33s)

[contain any](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m38s)

[color so now this code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m47s)

[Works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m50s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m52s)

[okay so we're going to take this and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m54s)

[think I think what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h12m58s)

[I like the idea of generating out in the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m00s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m04s)

[extensions color reference Etc I because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m07s)

[I I think what I want to write over](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m11s)

[here is down here at the bottom I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m14s)

[what I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m18s)

[write is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m19s)

[color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m22s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m25s)

[um primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m27s)

[mid like I think this is what I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m30s)

[do I think I think this is what I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m36s)

[want right that way that can go through](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m40s)

[like that that can go through like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m42s)

[that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m45s)

[uh these words must begin with uppercase](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m47s)

[characters which IDE](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m50s)

[no see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m57s)

[H sometimes sometimes yeah you can you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h13m58s)

[can shut](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m04s)

[up is there a fixed naming](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m05s)

[violation naming rule](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m09s)

[violation I don't want to name it like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m15s)

[that because that changes only the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m17s)

[Constructor parameter and that looks](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m18s)

[stupid is Grumble Grumble Grumble right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m21s)

[because when I do when I do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m25s)

[new right and I look at that I want the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m30s)

[parameter to appear lowercase if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m33s)

[capitalize it it makes it appear](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m34s)

[capitalized for no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m37s)

[benefit we're we're going to just not do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m43s)

[that thanks okay um so let's implement](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m46s)

[the rest of these oh oh actually hang](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m51s)

[on hang](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h14m56s)

[on uh implement the rest of the uh these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m01s)

[properties using the other enu](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m07s)

[members okay co- Pilot Impress](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m13s)

[me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m22s)

[y that's uh that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m25s)

[garbage try this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m29s)

[again public static color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m31s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m35s)

[secondary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m37s)

[mid get tell me when you figure it out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m39s)

[tell me when you figure it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m43s)

[out color reference do you see the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m45s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m48s)

[yet okay I'm kind of hoping](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m51s)

[I'm hoping Nell code figures out there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m56s)

[we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h15m58s)

[go see somebody figured out the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m00s)

[pattern here we go I believe that's iny](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m03s)

[code not co-pilot co-pilot take notes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m07s)

[and Tel code figured out the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m10s)

[pattern you did not so when people ask](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m12s)

[what's better in Tel code or co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m15s)

[there's the difference right there one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m17s)

[tries to use like context stuff the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m20s)

[other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m22s)

[uh can be completely stupid um and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m23s)

[occasionally brilliant and Implement](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m28s)

[whole classes for me details details](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m29s)

[okay so let's check](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m33s)

[um okay so we're going to move you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m40s)

[out think I want to change this and be a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m49s)

[little more](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m52s)

[explicit go like that I think I like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m55s)

[that better I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h16m57s)

[think okay now intell code I believe in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m02s)

[you thank](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m07s)

[you you remember back when we had to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m11s)

[like write code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m13s)

[ourselves in the Dark](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m15s)

[Ages uh okay so that handles all of that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m17s)

[and we fully implemented that okay so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m21s)

[next next next next next next if I run](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m23s)

[my gen right now it should](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m26s)

[fail actually it might get pretty close](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m30s)

[now that I think about](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m33s)

[it um because over](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m35s)

[here so right now it's blindly tacking](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m39s)

[on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m42s)

[this and if we had it delete that it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m44s)

[would](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m48s)

[work so in the theme generator we needed](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m50s)

[to not blindly tack on base color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m53s)

[themed or base themed colors](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h17m57s)

[dot but only in the case where it starts](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m01s)

[with the word color reference so if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m03s)

[go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m05s)

[here we could we could try to hunt it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m07s)

[down](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m09s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m24s)

[generate theme extension](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m25s)

[class uh no is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m29s)

[this yeah theme extensions](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m33s)

[better uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m38s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m39s)

[boom this guy does](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m41s)

[here this is where it is blindly tacking](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m44s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m48s)

[in uh right tree item so really I want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m49s)

[want to hunt down all usages of this in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m52s)

[here that's fine it's just those two](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h18m57s)

[excellent uh else](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h19m01s)

[aren't you no okay sure why not why not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h22m22s)

[now that we have it might as well use](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h22m27s)

[it um okay so there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h22m30s)

[dark these guys in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h22m59s)

[here this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m02s)

[doing that and I believe we're hitting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m05s)

[this case if I'm not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m07s)

[mistaken yeah because we're hitting uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m10s)

[resource key color reference primary mid](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m12s)

[so we just need to handle that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m16s)

[here else if uh value starts](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m19s)

[with and you'll know the the reason I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m33s)

[not doing like a a name of or a type um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m36s)

[is yeah collection initialize all the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m40s)

[things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m43s)

[the that is I think the biggest benefit](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m45s)

[so real quick we're going to we're going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m50s)

[to let's let's let just let's just talk](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m51s)

[about those things real quick C 12](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m53s)

[features there are there are two big big](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h23m56s)

[things inside here so primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m00s)

[constructure is great collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m02s)

[expressions and inline arrays these are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m05s)

[the big deals these are the ones that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m07s)

[are going to make a Big Splash in your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m09s)

[code base right this is utter gold in my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m11s)

[opinion it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m16s)

[simple but the number of times like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m18s)

[I just I really like the Elegance of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m24s)

[this and it works with dictionary this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m27s)

[works on custom collections as well as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m29s)

[long as you have something that supports](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m35s)

[initialization um The Collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m37s)

[initializers this just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m40s)

[works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m43s)

[oh okay well well done well done](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m46s)

[Benjamin I approve um I really should](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m49s)

[show that off there shouldn't I um the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m52s)

[so going from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m56s)

[here uh to being able to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h24m58s)

[wait where collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m02s)

[initialization this is collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m09s)

[initializer oh this is a collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m12s)

[initializer it's not the new feature we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m14s)

[should add that not a collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m16s)

[expression yeah um here we'll just do if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m19s)

[we go here and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m23s)

[go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m25s)

[collection pression](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m27s)

[um got to fix our search](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m32s)

[up anyway anyway this thing this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m40s)

[amazing it is awesome you can start](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m44s)

[abusing it the biggest benefit of here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m47s)

[is what they call the spread operator](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m49s)

[because we hadn't overloaded this dot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m52s)

[dot operator in C yet so naturally we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m54s)

[had to find a second use for it so that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m57s)

[we could confuse people because now this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h25m59s)

[dot dot operator can be two different](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m02s)

[things depending on context for those](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m05s)

[people who've seen the range and index](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m07s)

[syntax it can be used for that but it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m09s)

[can also be used to spread this is also](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m12s)

[where we would often use like the link](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m15s)

[select many call right that can kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m17s)

[go away in some cases where where you've](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m20s)

[got a couple Collections and you want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m22s)

[flatten the collection they call it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m25s)

[spread like butter just in this case](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m27s)

[it's more flattened like well spread](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m30s)

[like butter I I still like flattening](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m33s)

[the list so but you end up with rather](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m36s)

[than three arrays you get one array and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m38s)

[they're all spread out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m41s)

[nicely something like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m43s)

[that the um the other big one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m45s)

[uh where was the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m50s)

[oh the primary Constructors](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m53s)

[yes which I guess that one we've kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m55s)

[already](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m58s)

[shown um yes those are the big ones to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h26m59s)

[be aware of like but this this just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m03s)

[makes me absolutely](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m05s)

[happy absolutely](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m07s)

[happy cing primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m10s)

[Constructor yeah like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m13s)

[this thank you Benjamin appreciate that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m18s)

[uh okay so I want this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m23s)

[here and then I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m26s)

[do something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m28s)

[crazy don't know why I indented like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m30s)

[that there's no reason to indent like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m33s)

[that just looks funny uh okay so this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m37s)

[guy here if it's a color reference and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m40s)

[in this case our color reference is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m43s)

[going to be primary mid so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m44s)

[we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m48s)

[we what do we want it to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m50s)

[be what do we want it to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m54s)

[be I think the ideal situation of what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h27m57s)

[we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m01s)

[want let's just go to the the Dark theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m02s)

[one and change it so if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m06s)

[go let's figure out what we want and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m10s)

[then we'll go beat into submission](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m16s)

[um be big dark okay and this was line](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m19s)

[what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m23s)

[67 67 I suppose I could have scrolled](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m25s)

[until I saw the little green thing or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m28s)

[the green thing on this side it was just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m29s)

[too obvious so I didn't do that okay and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m31s)

[specifically these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m35s)

[colors this is where things get this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m37s)

[also another area where things get a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m39s)

[little weird](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m41s)

[because the colors](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m42s)

[live in a different project](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m46s)

[entirely um which I've contemplated](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m49s)

[flattening a number of times because I I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m52s)

[don't think we're getting much value out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m55s)

[of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m57s)

[it um this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h28m58s)

[accent so if we do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m01s)

[amber so I think what we want is we want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m04s)

[this guy to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m09s)

[be like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m11s)

[this and then let's go and change the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m14s)

[light one as well and then let's just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m17s)

[test this cuz I think I think this works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m19s)

[I don't know that for a fact but I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m22s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m24s)

[works we go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m25s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m28s)

[um let's see uh for CLI argument on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m31s)

[system command line I'm moving from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m34s)

[dragon fruit is it necessary to set kind](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m36s)

[of is required property and if so how](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m39s)

[does that work the docks seem to be old](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m41s)

[so one make sure that you're pulling](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m44s)

[your nugit package not from n.org but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m47s)

[from the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m51s)

[the private feed](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h29m56s)

[just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m37s)

[required so but setting that to True](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m40s)

[should get you the the behavior you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m43s)

[seek again the the it's mildly awkward](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m47s)

[depending on what you're doing um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m51s)

[because the people who set required to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m54s)

[be true on option options are by](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h30m57s)

[required defaults to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m03s)

[false but sometimes people prefer them](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m05s)

[over just straight arguments because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m09s)

[there's a name attached to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m12s)

[them so but an argument is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m14s)

[required uh okay so I think that works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m19s)

[and then let's check the oh we don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m22s)

[on it's kind of API specific and and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m37s)

[think it varies from thing to thing it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m40s)

[can be okay to have required options](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h31m43s)

[forgive yourself um out of a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m14s)

[problem the if you're set action calls](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m17s)

[another method that's where it starts to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m21s)

[get into a gray a it's like well can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m23s)

[your other method really assume that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m25s)

[it's only call or is set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m27s)

[action in those cases I may end up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m31s)

[throwing throwing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m33s)

[instead so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m36s)

[I if you're inside of set action I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m38s)

[you have enough context to to reasonably](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m40s)

[just n forgiving go yeah there's no way](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m43s)

[that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m45s)

[happens um okay and then these are going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m48s)

[to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m52s)

[be uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m55s)

[see it'll look like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h42m58s)

[this so probably should have done this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m02s)

[one at a time and then this one is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m04s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m08s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m10s)

[that this one's going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m13s)

[this this one is going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m17s)

[be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m19s)

[this then this goes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m23s)

[away that looks more like that okay and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m25s)

[this is just the getter not the not the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m30s)

[complete](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m34s)

[setter this is not that and then what we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m35s)

[really want is we want to look at that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m39s)

[test property on theme that I left](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m42s)

[myself because what we really want the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m46s)

[property to look like is this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m48s)

[our getter really needs to look like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m51s)

[that go back to brushes our getter needs](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m55s)

[to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h43m58s)

[be oh too many](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m00s)

[lambdas and then this is going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m03s)

[be uh brush. field](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m06s)

[name](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m10s)

[semicolon this is going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m12s)

[be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m16s)

[brush. field name](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m17s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m21s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m30s)

[once we'll come over here and we will](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m33s)

[undo do we will change this to the demo](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m38s)

[app before I do anything stupid and we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m42s)

[will try yet](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m44s)

[again and based on the air I'm going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m48s)

[go with I bot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m51s)

[something yeah](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m54s)

[I I did not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h44m59s)

[properly deal with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m03s)

[this try](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m09s)

[again](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m19s)

[there that's a lot less](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m21s)

[red oh interesting this does get to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m24s)

[problematic as these ones won't have the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m29s)

[resolve method inside of them because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m32s)

[they don't know about the theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m35s)

[class that is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m45s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m49s)

[now we could pass it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h45m56s)

[in and we could make this guy public or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h46m03s)

[at least](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h46m06s)

[internal that gets us past the first](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h46m09s)

[thing out if anybody hasn't seen it so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h46m34s)

[for people who use get Kraken you'll](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h46m37s)

[note there's this cool little purple](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h46m38s)

[link for kicks and Giggles we're just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h47m22s)

[going to paste that straight on in right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h47m24s)

[so if you open it uh yeah we'll do V get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h47m27s)

[lens and vs](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h47m31s)

[quick uh yes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h47m54s)

[open yes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h47m59s)

[opened okay you made this you made this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m02s)

[much harder than it needed to be okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m05s)

[we're going to try this one more time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m08s)

[from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m09s)

[I I click open I click open get lens I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m13s)

[click](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m18s)

[open](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m19s)

[and git lens confirms or vs code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m21s)

[confirms with me that I actually want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m25s)

[open it and poof we're in and so I can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m26s)

[now go through and say oh let's let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m29s)

[take a look at these changes and where](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m31s)

[where is this open file oh I don't it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m34s)

[doesn't know where the doesn't know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m37s)

[where the theme thing is okay fine we'll](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m39s)

[open it and get cracked](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m41s)

[client](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m46s)

[well it works better when you uh don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m47s)

[have the existing changes right here but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m50s)

[it short version it allows you to share](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m52s)

[your kind of your working changes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m56s)

[without necessarily needing to go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m57s)

[through the effort of create a create a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h48m59s)

[commit push it up send it over back and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m02s)

[forth](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m04s)

[um and so it it can be quite convenient](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m06s)

[now at present you will get a warning](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m10s)

[when you first click the button because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m12s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m14s)

[sending your your code up to get Kraken](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m16s)

[servers now they are not looking at your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m20s)

[code they are storing it encrypted at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m22s)

[rest however some people get real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m24s)

[Twitchy about their code ending up on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m27s)

[somebody else's server no matter how it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m29s)

[gets there no matter how it stored so be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m31s)

[cautious with that um there is future](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m33s)

[updates coming for this stay tuned it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m37s)

[will be cool](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m42s)

[yeah yeah and I to answer your question](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m44s)

[Benjamin I think to apply it you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m46s)

[actually have to have a clone of the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m48s)

[repo in order for it to work nicely but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m50s)

[it's it's an area that's actively being](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m52s)

[worked on this is why it's a preview](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m54s)

[feature and not a ready to use feature](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m56s)

[because there's a lot of edge cases uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h49m59s)

[do you know of any go git tools that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m01s)

[could wrap](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m03s)

[SVN uh but I keep trying to use](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m05s)

[git](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m08s)

[uh not that can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m14s)

[wrap not that can wrap the the the hard](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m18s)

[part is they are fundamentally different](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m22s)

[in how they want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m24s)

[to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m26s)

[work with now we oftentimes use git like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m28s)

[SVN where we we more or less commit push](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m32s)

[and it's back and forth we don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m35s)

[like oftentimes that whole distributed](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m38s)

[nature of how git can work rarely gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m41s)

[used right we we built this highly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m43s)

[distributed Source control solution and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m46s)

[then centralized it in one place it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m48s)

[like oh yeah there's a little bit of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m50s)

[irony in that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m51s)

[so I don't like there's tools out there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m54s)

[that will let you like if you have to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h50m57s)

[get off of SN and convert to get there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m00s)

[are tools that'll do it and do it quite](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m02s)

[well um but I don't know of anything](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m05s)

[that'll wrap it for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m08s)

[you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m10s)

[uh couldn't actually just couldn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m13s)

[actually apply oh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m15s)

[interesting I wonder why](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m17s)

[oh I bet you I have a theory hang on one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m21s)

[second I bet you it's because the base](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m24s)

[commit wasn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m27s)

[pushed can you can you uh grab the uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m34s)

[the more color updates branch and then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m38s)

[click the link again](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m40s)

[Benjamin](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m42s)

[uh the best time to migrate from SN to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m45s)

[get was yesterday the second best is now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m48s)

[I will say when I first started out SVN](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m50s)

[was was the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m52s)

[hotness and we used SVN at work and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m54s)

[even had my own SV SVN server at home](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h51m58s)

[that I managed with visual SVN oh boy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m00s)

[running a Windows Home Server a tiny](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m03s)

[little box I think I still have that box](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m05s)

[um closer now I get the same air you got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m09s)

[uh okay well I will dig into it more and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m13s)

[see if I can get uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m17s)

[get it actually working or I'll start](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m20s)

[submitting bug reports one of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m22s)

[two the um but yeah so it was very good](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m24s)

[and I the big Advantage I I think I see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m30s)

[is being able to work offline and some](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m33s)

[people it's like oh you never do that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m37s)

[with Git it's like well sometimes I do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m38s)

[sometimes it's real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m41s)

[convenient but I will say SVN](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m43s)

[was it was simpler G has a much steeper](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m46s)

[learning](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m50s)

[curve uh but company policy is they have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m51s)

[SVN full stop meh yeah that sounds like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m55s)

[somebody's like that type of policy made](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h52m59s)

[a lot of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m02s)

[sense about 15 years](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m04s)

[ago it sounds like somebody made a good](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m08s)

[policy 15 years ago and never bother to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m10s)

[review it again that's my theory with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m14s)

[knowing nothing else about the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m16s)

[company pitchforks pitchforks and signs](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m18s)

[yes yes yes well I shouldn't encourage](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m22s)

[pitchforks and signs](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m25s)

[um uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m29s)

[okay we're going to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m32s)

[this do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m35s)

[this I don't remember where where I left](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m38s)

[off here so I'm going to just rerun this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m40s)

[and see where it breaks because clearly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m42s)

[something is going to broke oh that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m45s)

[right we were going to pass in the we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m47s)

[the resolve method doesn't work at the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m49s)

[top level so we either pass well I guess](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m52s)

[we have to pass theme all the way in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m57s)

[because the resolve method requires](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h53m59s)

[theme to actually work so um we're going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m00s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m04s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m05s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m11s)

[writer right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m14s)

[line writer](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m17s)

[uh right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m20s)

[line uh let's see let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m22s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m28s)

[indent why didn't I do indent on all of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m30s)

[these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m33s)

[ones seems](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m36s)

[dumb the only reason this isn't blowing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m38s)

[up oh I know why this is relative indent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m41s)

[oh that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m45s)

[interesting okay that's sorry what I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m47s)

[mean by relative indent is because the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m49s)

[generated class here is these are nested](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m52s)

[classes all the way down so this gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h54m56s)

[the the indent ends being here see if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m00s)

[can find one that's multiple levels deep](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m02s)

[I not even have any there we go combo](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m05s)

[box into popup multiple levels of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m08s)

[desting so there's that okay so we want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m13s)

[a Constructor so public](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m15s)

[uh let's see and then it's going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m23s)

[guy and then it's going to take in a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m25s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m29s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m31s)

[oh uh I got a bad idea got a really bad](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m43s)

[idea](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m48s)

[no no I was going to primary Constructor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m50s)

[it I don't think I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m53s)

[though is it'll gen something for me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m56s)

[that I don't like nope nope nope](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h55m59s)

[resisting temptation to primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m02s)

[Constructor all the things resisting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m04s)

[temptation uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m08s)

[see and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m12s)

[then private](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m17s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m20s)

[theme Pro](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m41s)

[new argument](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m45s)

[n exception](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m47s)

[I know there's new methods for this I am](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m51s)

[aware um okay and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m54s)

[underscore theme I don't think this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m56s)

[quite](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h56m59s)

[works because I think it's going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m00s)

[break on my top level](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m02s)

[classes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m04s)

[but let's let's see where it gets me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m09s)

[to okay so it got pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m12s)

[good obviously all the invocations of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m16s)

[new are problematic](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m18s)

[IC so we need to let's fix that real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m20s)

[quick uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m38s)

[see oh this can't do new because this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m43s)

[isn't a static](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m47s)

[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m50s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h57m53s)

[interesting that would require me to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m03s)

[make this read](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m05s)

[only and apply it at a nested](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m07s)

[level what's the easiest way to do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m15s)

[syntactic](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m18s)

[also check up here I assume all of these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m20s)

[are similar problems yeah this is the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m22s)

[one I was worried about](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m24s)

[is this one really just needs to be this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m26s)

[or not at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m28s)

[all so we'll have to deal with those and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m31s)

[then these ones again are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m35s)

[this yeah and this won't be available in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m40s)

[this context either](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m43s)

[so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m48s)

[what is the correct way to go about](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m51s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m54s)

[this is is this the appropriate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h58m57s)

[thing just a little torn at the moment I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m01s)

[I like this I did not like this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m04s)

[Constructor I guess I kind of it's the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m11s)

[only it's the only way that's going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m14s)

[play nice um we're going to do one more](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m16s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m19s)

[here add](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m20s)

[this that may be Overkill let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m22s)

[look um yeah because it's putting an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m27s)

[extra white space here so that's this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m29s)

[this one really just should have been at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m31s)

[the bottom okay so there's that that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m33s)

[will fix the formatting now the problem](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m37s)

[being we need to know the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m40s)

[children and appropriately initialize](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m44s)

[them](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m46s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m48s)

[because we aren't going to be able to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m54s)

[unintended that goes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m56s)

[away but what we can do is we can take](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=01h59m58s)

[this guy here because we've already got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m01s)

[a tree](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m03s)

[structure and actually that means do we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m06s)

[even need we do need a store theme for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m09s)

[the resolve](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m10s)

[cost](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m15s)

[um and then I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m18s)

[need this amount of white space to go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m21s)

[here and this needs to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m26s)

[be because that's type namespace](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m30s)

[name get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m37s)

[new](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m39s)

[theme that goes like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m41s)

[that and that fixes the uninitialized](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m46s)

[nature of it so I think that gets me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m49s)

[most of the most of them aside from the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m50s)

[top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m53s)

[level okay good so we're down to just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h00m58s)

[top yeah so that if we go and look at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m02s)

[like combo box popup theme uh like combo](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m05s)

[box has a popups does the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m08s)

[needful okay aside from an extra white](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m12s)

[space I know it's a minor thing I know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m14s)

[it's a minor thing but it bothers me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m16s)

[bothers me must have it be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m19s)

[pretty I'm going to generate code darn](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m22s)

[it it's going to look like pretty code I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m24s)

[want it to look like co-pilot wrote it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m26s)

[or at least like I did](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m28s)

[um okay so that handles that so now we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m34s)

[just need to deal with the top level](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m36s)

[ones where we have to deal with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m38s)

[this and we need a top level](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m42s)

[Constructor so uh how do we we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m46s)

[find top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m50s)

[level so top level](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m54s)

[item uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h01m58s)

[see uh if it tree item](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m04s)

[dot what what do my Tree items have I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m09s)

[don't remember I built these I built](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m12s)

[this and then I've forgotten what exists](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m14s)

[in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m16s)

[it um oh collection initial ready here's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m17s)

[the other one oh Mah Mah from four or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m21s)

[five characters to two characters](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m26s)

[wonderful yeah you can see it's horribly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m32s)

[complicated](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m36s)

[boom such small improvements the code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m42s)

[has gotten such](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m45s)

[smaller Okay so this thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m47s)

[here I guess we technically know it from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m55s)

[indent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h02m57s)

[level we start at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m02s)

[zero](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m05s)

[um we also know it based upon if the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m16s)

[name is null or Whit space or not we've](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m20s)

[got two ways to check it I kind of like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m25s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m27s)

[one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m28s)

[um it's only a problem](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m33s)

[there maybe we just conditional](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m37s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m40s)

[if ring is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m42s)

[noar is noar white space on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m45s)

[free item.](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m49s)

[name I kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m53s)

[like let's do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h03m58s)

[um public bull](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m05s)

[is top level I don't know if I like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m11s)

[that twitch twitch twitch which is I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m17s)

[can't decide can't decide uh okay so if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m20s)

[if it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m23s)

[null we're going to do this and we are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m24s)

[going to drop](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m27s)

[this uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m29s)

[else going to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m31s)

[this okay that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m34s)

[fixes that bit of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m37s)

[generation and now it should just be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m42s)

[around the need for the Constructor okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m45s)

[so we've handled all of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m51s)

[these excellent excellent excellent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m53s)

[excellent excellent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m56s)

[excellent okay so let's come back over](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h04m58s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m02s)

[um this is now the entire](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m14s)

[Constructor but I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m17s)

[wondering we actually do want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m20s)

[generate the Constructor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m23s)

[everywhere it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m40s)

[subtle because we can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m43s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m47s)

[because I'm guessing there's an if down](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m49s)

[here yeah it there's got the it's got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m51s)

[the same if down](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m53s)

[here I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m55s)

[think we want to I'm going to propose to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h05m58s)

[follow me we get rid of this if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m00s)

[statement Al](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m01s)

[together we get rid of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m04s)

[this we get rid of this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m07s)

[okay and then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m10s)

[here most of this is going to come](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m13s)

[out of here and go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m17s)

[here uh so we want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m22s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m26s)

[this here so how about we do this bu is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m31s)

[top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m37s)

[level](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m38s)

[gets we'll do this here and then and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m42s)

[then we can then we can collapse this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m45s)

[logic so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m47s)

[uh if is top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m49s)

[level we want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m53s)

[generate uh right or right line and we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m57s)

[want to go partial class](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h06m59s)

[theme we don't care about any indent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m02s)

[we're just going to straight up do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m05s)

[that okay so that goes there uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m07s)

[else we are going to generate this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m12s)

[bit okay that much works great now we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m17s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m21s)

[here we do an open curly brace and then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m24s)

[we do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m27s)

[if is top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m29s)

[level oh hold up hold up no no no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m33s)

[there's no way you figured that out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m35s)

[co-pilot yeah okay good okay good my job](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m37s)

[is safe okay you scared me co-pilot you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m41s)

[scared me as though you were going going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m45s)

[to actually do the right thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m48s)

[thankfully not that scared uh okay so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m51s)

[we're going to need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h07m54s)

[that you know what let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m03s)

[do the class definition is fine but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m04s)

[let's there's going to be a little](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m07s)

[duplication here but I think it makes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m09s)

[more](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m11s)

[sense to do the entire starting of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m12s)

[Constructor uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m21s)

[H speaking of get Kraken they're sending](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m23s)

[emails telling me that my trial has been](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m26s)

[reactivated um I'm not on a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m30s)

[trial](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m34s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m36s)

[exciting um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m38s)

[okay so instead what we want here is we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m41s)

[want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m47s)

[uh we don't actually so we don't need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m50s)

[this one we need this one to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m51s)

[be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m55s)

[theme we don't want any parameters and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h08m57s)

[we just want this we will do all of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m00s)

[this we will do all of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m03s)

[this we will then close the Constructor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m11s)

[and write a new line this will work](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m14s)

[flawlessly the first](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m17s)

[time dang](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m24s)

[it okay well flawlessly the first time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m27s)

[may have been a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m30s)

[stretch](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m31s)

[um that goes there and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m34s)

[then uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m44s)

[string theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m46s)

[value gets see you were so close so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m49s)

[close uh no it's either going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m53s)

[this or theme thank you for playing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h09m57s)

[along okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m02s)

[um this will work flawlessly the second](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m07s)

[try](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m13s)

[Booyah okay why do we have a using](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m16s)

[statement oh we don't need the using](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m19s)

[statement anymore](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m22s)

[because we've gotten rid of all of our](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m24s)

[references to color out of here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m26s)

[okay so Jen that one more](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m29s)

[time take a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m33s)

[look uh does copilot train off of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m40s)

[accepted code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m43s)

[Snippets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m45s)

[so training the AI engine requires a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m47s)

[substantial amount of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m50s)

[work however what I do know is they they](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m52s)

[collect a lot of metrics about how it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h10m58s)

[performing because you don't want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m01s)

[allow an agent to just blindly train off](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m05s)

[of random stuff because then people can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m08s)

[poison the pool as it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m10s)

[were um they do collect a lot of metrics](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m14s)

[uh obious viously the easy one is how](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m17s)

[often a suggestion was accepted versus](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m19s)

[not but the other thing that they do is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m22s)

[there's a little um process that will go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m24s)

[back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m28s)

[and if you accept a suggestion they will](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m29s)

[go back a few minutes later and um check](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m33s)

[if that code is still in place as is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m38s)

[specifically because they want to know](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m41s)

[if somebody really did accept it and it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m43s)

[was correct or whether they accept](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m46s)

[accepted it and went back and edited it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m48s)

[or whether you know maybe there was an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m50s)

[accidental accept so if you accept the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m52s)

[suggestion and it's still there several](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m54s)

[minutes later that will get recorded as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m55s)

[yep good job co-pilot versus if you go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h11m58s)

[through and tweak it or something then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m01s)

[there's I don't know some amount of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m03s)

[grading of you know what what you did um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m04s)

[but yes they they do report back the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m09s)

[metrics on what's accepted and whatnot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m11s)

[so yeah that that much is very much](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m15s)

[there so trained I don't know I suspect](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m18s)

[the answer is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m24s)

[not like there's some amount of training](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m26s)

[that goes in for the purpose](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m29s)

[of like learning your repository so that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m32s)

[it can follow your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m36s)

[conventions um but those are as I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m38s)

[understand it layers on top not like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m41s)

[retrain model so it it's an overloaded](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m44s)

[sentence but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m49s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m51s)

[is okay all of this because I didn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m55s)

[want to go and write the code to do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m57s)

[yet and I feel like I probably should](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h12m59s)

[have just written the code to go and do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m01s)

[that at this point](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m02s)

[like we've now changed theme. g. CS](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m04s)

[enough times so this is probably getting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m08s)

[close](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m16s)

[okay we launched that's a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m18s)

[plus okay okay okay so now we need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m26s)

[check and confirm because I think what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m30s)

[is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m34s)

[on this appears to have because we set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m35s)

[this up as what did we change I because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m38s)

[it was the on the brush we changed the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m42s)

[foreground to be to the foreground color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m46s)

[of the raised button which is the one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m49s)

[that gets used for the primary button](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m52s)

[here to be the the split button](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m53s)

[background so if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m56s)

[go UN in doubt we get our old trusty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h13m59s)

[Snoop out so it's going to be these mid](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m02s)

[buttons is what we're looking for here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m04s)

[let's let's just let's just Snoop this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m06s)

[sucker out and confirm what what I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m09s)

[I already know I'm pretty sure I could](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m11s)

[visually see it but let's let's just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m13s)

[confirm so step one check the style](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m15s)

[style material design raise button](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m19s)

[perfect that's the one we changed check](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m21s)

[the foreground](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m23s)

[property](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m25s)

[foreground is set to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m26s)

[the split button background okay good](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m29s)

[now for the big test we go here and we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m34s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m37s)

[a uh a color thing and we want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m38s)

[change we broke something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m44s)

[okay we're going to change the primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m49s)

[mid color to be I don't know something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m51s)

[something](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m55s)

[obvious right if I go back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h14m56s)

[here m](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m04s)

[m I'm happy I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m09s)

[happy okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m13s)

[that that makes me that makes me real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m16s)

[excited okay so now let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m19s)

[fix this thing so that when we generate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m22s)

[it I do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m24s)

[crap that' be great that'd be real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m25s)

[great and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m30s)

[then we will have support for being able](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m32s)

[to plug](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m36s)

[in that stuff and then we might go I'm](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m37s)

[trying to decide if I leave the split](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m40s)

[button thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m42s)

[in um in here or if I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m44s)

[take it out of the Json file and just go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m48s)

[add it on the the other branch and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m50s)

[rebase Grumble Grumble Grumble don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m53s)

[know okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m55s)

[so okay so that handles that uh I need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h15m57s)

[the one that generates the zaml theming](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m01s)

[dictionary which I believe is this one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m03s)

[what no not not diff show thank you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m06s)

[um yeah so this is here now what we need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m14s)

[to do because right now when we run this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m19s)

[guy we are going to get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m22s)

[through we are going to get through the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m28s)

[value down here which was color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m32s)

[reference primary mid so this is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m35s)

[to basically be the same](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m37s)

[as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m40s)

[um the other one so we would like to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m43s)

[break this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m47s)

[up um so in that particular](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m49s)

[case](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m54s)

[uh switch](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m56s)

[on value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h16m59s)

[sub um and actually let's do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h17m07s)

[um private con string color reference](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h17m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h17m19s)

[prefix](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h17m21s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h18m52s)

[support in Visual Studio not as good as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m00s)

[vs code not there yet uh okay so this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m02s)

[based upon what we wanted here is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m10s)

[to end up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m11s)

[being we need to convert it into these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m13s)

[strings and the the hard one is this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m16s)

[primary mid one because it's going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m19s)

[little ugly like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m22s)

[that um let's see just do this for the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m24s)

[moment get it happy but that would](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m28s)

[require typing accuracy that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m32s)

[me and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m38s)

[then then we're going to end up having](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m41s)

[to do a little throw here at the end](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m43s)

[because I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m45s)

[is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m46s)

[co-pilot so helpful you're so helpful](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m51s)

[you I guess that was a tel code again I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m53s)

[keep giving co-pilot credit for things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m55s)

[it didn't write I need to stop doing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h19m56s)

[secondary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h20m46s)

[we could probably have changed up the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h20m51s)

[enum value so that these things aligned](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h20m52s)

[a little nicer but I don't mind having](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h20m54s)

[these types of little](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h20m57s)

[to throw if they are rever out of six so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m01s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m04s)

[like okay so now I shouldn't have to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m04s)

[my undos anymore so we can save this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m07s)

[and now when I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m10s)

[though I created this resource key I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m28s)

[didn't bother to use it anywhere so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m31s)

[that's that's not a very useful bit of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m33s)

[themes that was](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h21m54s)

[complicated but I think I'm happy with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m00s)

[where it landed I think I am happy with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m02s)

[where it landed um let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m04s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m09s)

[um do we need to test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m13s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m16s)

[I almost wonder if the answer is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m22s)

[yes it's one of those how much testing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m27s)

[do you need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m29s)

[do on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m31s)

[this uh let's see this is UI](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m33s)

[test or do we just write a couple of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m41s)

[tests directly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m45s)

[and call it a day because I think what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m47s)

[we really are after is I want to make](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m50s)

[sure the resolve method](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m52s)

[Works uh what do you think of as uh ASP](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m55s)

[boiler plate uh there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h22m59s)

[is actually maybe I'm GNA think before I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m04s)

[open my mouth too much on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m06s)

[this it's not as bad as I have seen in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m12s)

[other Frameworks](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m16s)

[because there's a big trade-off between](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m18s)

[features that you get and how much code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m19s)

[you have to write and to some degree old](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m22s)

[ASP net like the MVC stuff there was a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m27s)

[decent amount of boiler plate but a lot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m30s)

[of it you got generated for you for free](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m33s)

[with your new project template and you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m35s)

[didn't need to do much addition of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m37s)

[boilerplate which was good and with the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m40s)

[um shoot what is the flat method things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h23m43s)

[problem but yes it can look at it can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h32m41s)

[look at your current project to be able](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h32m45s)

[to um to learn and go through from it um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h32m46s)

[and and people do panic because they](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h32m51s)

[to just we're going to pick on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m19s)

[foreground for the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m20s)

[moment then we want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m22s)

[say](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m25s)

[foreground uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m27s)

[see cannot convert from color reference](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m34s)

[to system date](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m37s)

[time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m41s)

[huh Visual Studio what do you think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m43s)

[think is a date time object in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m45s)

[this I'm I'm sorry Visual Studio you're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m51s)

[getting screenshotted for this because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m54s)

[this that's funny that is that is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h41m56s)

[funny last I checked let me just make](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m03s)

[sure the foreground property didn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m06s)

[change to a datetime yeah it didn't okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m08s)

[good](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m11s)

[um I mean that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m12s)

[argument two cannot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m17s)

[convert yeah like what I I have to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m21s)

[believe okay I bet you I bet you we fix](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m25s)

[it if we do this I'm willing to the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m28s)

[implicit conversion it doesn't know the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m30s)

[right thing to convert from now the fact](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m33s)

[that it landed on date time is a little](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m35s)

[awkward](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m37s)

[um it's a reminder that it's time for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m39s)

[your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m42s)

[date uh uh okay uh can set foreground](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m43s)

[with uh how about theme color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m48s)

[reference right so we want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m54s)

[do theme color reference uh primary mid](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h42m57s)

[and we want this to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m03s)

[be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m04s)

[red because this is the primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m06s)

[color yeah okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m10s)

[so uh uh imagine new programmers](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m13s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m19s)

[yeah uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m21s)

[see no see co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m24s)

[public void can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m27s)

[set I don't need to test all of them um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m31s)

[because they're all generated I just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m34s)

[want to make sure the syntax stays](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m35s)

[working uh with uh color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m37s)

[reference okay write the method for me](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m42s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m44s)

[come on come](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m46s)

[on nothing nothing you're not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m49s)

[gonna so I always forget what the in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m54s)

[trigger inline](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h43m57s)

[suggestion that is not what I want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m02s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m04s)

[you okay I told you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m07s)

[color reference I told you what I wanted](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m10s)

[just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m14s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m19s)

[see uh let's see we want to do theme](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m20s)

[color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m24s)

[reference primary](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m26s)

[mid oh actually I think I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m29s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m33s)

[color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m34s)

[reference primary mid I think I want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m37s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m40s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m42s)

[um and do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m44s)

[that is there anything else worth](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m47s)

[testing I think this is all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m49s)

[good I don't know how to write](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h44m52s)

[test actually that so testing is one of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m05s)

[those areas that is a kind of a passion](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m10s)

[area of mine one second I if you want if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m13s)

[you want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m17s)

[more](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m18s)

[uh don't don't you worry hang on your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m21s)

[favorite content creator](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m23s)

[has links I just need to find](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m26s)

[them I really should keep a I really](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m31s)

[should keep a a list of these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m34s)

[um this one this one here is one of my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m41s)

[favorites](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m44s)

[uh share copy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m45s)

[so this one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m49s)

[is very much one of my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m54s)

[favorites](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h45m58s)

[um there is another one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m00s)

[here that I did that I really](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m05s)

[liked um and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m11s)

[then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m14s)

[especially for people who are diving in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m16s)

[and doing like aspet core type stuff and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m18s)

[testing that one there is a a good](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m23s)

[resource as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m26s)

[well okay cool all of those test pass](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m30s)

[yay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m33s)

[okay it's worth noting like we write](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m35s)

[tests with a unit testing framework but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m38s)

[that doesn't make everything a unit test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m40s)

[and not all unit tests are the same](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m42s)

[right in this case I have written these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m45s)

[tests less around getting the test to um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m47s)

[pass but I mean like the behavior is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m51s)

[important but it's more around the idea](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m53s)

[of making](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h46m56s)

[sure that this compiles and works the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m00s)

[way I expect because this is it's the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m03s)

[reason I'm not bothering to test every](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m06s)

[property I've autogenerate all of these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m08s)

[and when you're writing a test you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m10s)

[really need to ask the question what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m12s)

[what type of bug am I trying to prevent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m14s)

[right if you're trying to write a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m17s)

[pinning](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m18s)

[test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m19s)

[um oh test it rights oh good by the way](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m21s)

[if you've got feedback for it feel free](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m25s)

[to to let me know I I keep wanting to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m28s)

[more of more more related stuff so if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m30s)

[that is interesting I really I really](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m34s)

[like doing testing stuff at some point I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m36s)

[want to go through and do um kind of a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m39s)

[full auto marer one um um there was a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m42s)

[very](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m45s)

[interesting post that came out on the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m47s)

[app formerly known as Twitter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m53s)

[that uh um there was somebody who made a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m55s)

[comment that said uh I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h47m59s)

[remember the word he used I I call him](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m01s)

[simulators he had a different word for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m03s)

[them fakes doubles similar um over Mock](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m05s)

[and I agree with him but everybody](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m10s)

[jumped on him and oh no it was a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m12s)

[he posted a thing about how there was a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m15s)

[really ugly looking test and to his](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m17s)

[credit I kind of agree that the test](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m20s)

[looked mildly ugly but it it looks the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m22s)

[way a lot of people write tests because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m25s)

[most people write the code first and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m27s)

[then go and write the test and they](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m28s)

[basically test the implementation that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m29s)

[they just wrote and then question why](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m31s)

[they're writing test which is a valid](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m33s)

[question um there is a concept called um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m35s)

[test driven development that were and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m39s)

[think the um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m42s)

[that was kind of the one in the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m45s)

[um the test it right type approach where](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m49s)

[I I I tried to hammer home the idea of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m54s)

[tdd if you rather than test driven](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m57s)

[development test driven design um using](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h48m59s)

[the test to design the code rather than](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m02s)

[than](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m05s)

[to uh just develop it which is sort of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m05s)

[what we had done here where I had I had](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m09s)

[thrown together the the API that I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m11s)

[wanted and then we you know beat the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m13s)

[code into submission until it actually](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m15s)

[works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m18s)

[uh stuff as involved in real use cases](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m21s)

[yes yes and that's that's usually the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m24s)

[critique of mocks is you're you're not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m26s)

[testing the real thing therefore what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m28s)

[are you actually testing and I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m30s)

[that is a valid critique as an author of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m32s)

[Auto mocker or I should say one of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m34s)

[maintainers of it um I think it gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m36s)

[overused and and I'm one of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m41s)

[maintainers so I feel like I get to say](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m43s)

[that um I think we're good here I think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m46s)

[we're good where did my where did my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h49m50s)

[update uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m02s)

[yeah yeah this so for those people who](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m05s)

[have been using notepad++ simply because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m10s)

[it would keep tabs open and remember](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m13s)

[your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m15s)

[files notepad can now do it can it show](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m17s)

[line endings though oh see now you're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m20s)

[you are asking for a lot we just got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m22s)

[tabs I highly doubt it um I don't think](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m25s)

[they gave it all that M Min features I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m28s)

[think this was literally for the uh top](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m32s)

[one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m38s)

[um yeah so so yeah so conveniently](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m40s)

[notepad now has that so if you if you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m45s)

[use it as a um secondary clipboard like](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m48s)

[I occasionally do um it now works for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m51s)

[that uh okay we should probably before I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h52m57s)

[get too carried away um we deleted that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m01s)

[we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m04s)

[regen um so that I don't just so now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m06s)

[that I deleted the brush off of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m10s)

[here what like why something is up with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m13s)

[my Explorer it's like and this monitor](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m16s)

[specifically I don't know what's going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m18s)

[on I'm time for a reboot I'm guessing um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m19s)

[let's see so we made this guy internal](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m24s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m27s)

[fine I don't this is a big mess of it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m28s)

[works so we're not going to worry about](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m32s)

[it we did that that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m35s)

[okay I don't think I want to keep this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m39s)

[for now we did all of that effort so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m41s)

[that we didn't need to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m43s)

[that okay oh uh brushes. CS we need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m46s)

[go fix that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m51s)

[up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m52s)

[um because we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m54s)

[created this guy which means we can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h53m56s)

[now that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m04s)

[fine but this one this is what I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m06s)

[want color reference prefix boom](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m09s)

[done](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m13s)

[now my clipboard history have unlimited](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m16s)

[history because I use that way too](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m19s)

[much I mean that that has gotten some](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m21s)

[love in in recent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m23s)

[updates So for anybody unfamiliar with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m26s)

[it just press Windows key uh C and if](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m29s)

[you don't have the multi clipboard](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m33s)

[feature enabled it will prompt you to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m34s)

[enable](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m36s)

[it uh let's see all of those things are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m37s)

[fine uh let's see finish](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m41s)

[support for color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m45s)

[references and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m48s)

[then actually we don't even need to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m51s)

[that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m53s)

[amend adding support for color](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h54m55s)

[references in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m00s)

[themes boom see that easy mode and now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m03s)

[we're going to just double check this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m07s)

[and make sure uh we should add in here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m09s)

[uh bumped demos to net](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m13s)

[8 uh that's going to break my pipeline](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m18s)

[so we're going to go fix](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m21s)

[that I just want to double check the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m22s)

[changes in here before I get too carried](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m24s)

[away](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m27s)

[uh that is yeah so great question um I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m34s)

[have been using it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m38s)

[for I think probably the last three](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m40s)

[three and a half years](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m44s)

[um I think what I will say is it depends](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m47s)

[on as far as features go it uh it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m50s)

[depends on what you value on Fork I I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m53s)

[will not say Kraken is bug free or has](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h55m56s)

[um great features uh well it has a lot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m00s)

[of great features but there are other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m04s)

[tools that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m06s)

[have different variations of features so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m07s)

[for example um a common one that comes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m10s)

[up is like when you are doing a rebase](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m12s)

[and get Kraken you get the same level of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m15s)

[features as what you would get um in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m18s)

[terms of the merging if you did it with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m21s)

[like the CLI or similar it's it's no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m23s)

[fancier than that um whereas some tools](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m25s)

[like jet brains Rider they'll do a more](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m28s)

[context sensitive rebase to try to help](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m30s)

[things play out great like so is that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m33s)

[bad no they're they're surfacing that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m37s)

[same information does it give you the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m40s)

[additional help that some of the other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m42s)

[tools have not quite um I'm not aware of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m43s)

[any features for cast that get crack and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m47s)

[doesn't I actually did](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m51s)

[a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h56m59s)

[uh kindy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m02s)

[of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m05s)

[videos](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m09s)

[yeah no th this guy may be a little](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m10s)

[biased](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m15s)

[um Fork was on the list here so if you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m17s)

[want to see](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m21s)

[um me go through and compare I I I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m24s)

[basically run through just a kind](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m27s)

[of common workflows of showing how you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m30s)

[do it in each um I bear in mind that was](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m33s)

[a little over a year ago that I recorded](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m37s)

[that so any updates they've done since](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m39s)

[then are not obviously included](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m41s)

[um and so it's the there there's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m45s)

[obviously been changes in all of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m48s)

[tools since then but hopefully I did it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m50s)

[I did each of them Justice because I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m52s)

[tried to make sure that I spent enough](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m54s)

[time with each of the other tools to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m56s)

[make sure that people weren't going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m58s)

[go oh you're just an idiot you don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h57m59s)

[know how to use I'm like no I like I I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m01s)

[like to think I understand git and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m04s)

[like to think that I UND and it well](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m06s)

[enough to to test other tools in common](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m09s)

[workflows but yeah the the rebase is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m11s)

[really nice um the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m14s)

[UI interaction I I don't know how people](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m16s)

[do get without some sort of visual](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m21s)

[representation I do not understand](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m24s)

[people who who can somehow grock the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m26s)

[commit graph in their head that does not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m29s)

[make sense to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m31s)

[me this type of picture and the yeah the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m33s)

[interactive rebase is great and git](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m36s)

[Kraken has been putting a lot of effort](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m38s)

[into adding um quite a few Dev tools](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m40s)

[um they they've even been going to the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m45s)

[effort of their uh terminal stuff and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m47s)

[I'll show one more thing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m51s)

[off uh nope not that just get cracken](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m55s)

[dodev um so there is a a lot of stuff in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h58m59s)

[there um uh where is the did they move](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m05s)

[it where did it go guys I think you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m10s)

[moved](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m13s)

[um they had a cool thing yeah I guess](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m16s)

[they just moved it straight to get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m20s)

[kraken.com](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m21s)

[but um they've been trying to kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m22s)

[Rebrand themselves rather than just a um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m25s)

[a get gooey they they want it to be a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m28s)

[more integrated development experience](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m33s)

[specifically around](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m35s)

[collaboration um so they are to some](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m37s)

[degree it's trying to push their higher](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m40s)

[skew plans um for like teams or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m42s)

[Enterprise for reference right](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m45s)

[now 50% off get cracken pro at only $4 a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m48s)

[month so if you want a cheap deal on it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m52s)

[it's really cheap right now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m55s)

[um the and you can always try them for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=02h59m57s)

[free I forget how long it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m00s)

[the 30 days week something like that but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m03s)

[you can always play with them for a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m07s)

[little bit and just to see if it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m08s)

[actually does the what you want um but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m09s)

[there is there's a lot of cool stuff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m14s)

[coming for the the client the CLI and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m16s)

[trying to kind of bring all of this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m20s)

[together that's kind of like with the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m22s)

[cloud patches that I attempted to show](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m23s)

[earlier the idea of giving that level of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m25s)

[collaboration to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m28s)

[people](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m29s)

[um branding is top tier yeah get cracket](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m32s)

[they have a lot of a lot of people doing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m36s)

[a lot of branding level stuff yeah and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m38s)

[yeah I agree CLI users are bit different](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m41s)

[and not to say that fork is bad by any](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m44s)

[means um because Fork is actually a this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m46s)

[um this is a I believe a husband and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m52s)

[wife crew that that build this um and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m54s)

[remarkably well like of all because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h00m59s)

[there is a handful of git tools out](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m02s)

[there that are not worth your time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m04s)

[like Fork is not one of them Fork is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m08s)

[actually like if somebody comes up and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m11s)

[tells me yeah I I really like Fork as my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m14s)

[G client I got no objections like it is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m16s)

[it is a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m20s)

[reasonable uh and well-built](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m22s)

[Tool so no no problem there sometimes I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m24s)

[I think especially the tools that are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m30s)

[very heavy multiplatform I think Mac](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m33s)

[gets to influence the design a little](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m35s)

[bit and I kind of like like my opinion](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m37s)

[get crack is just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m39s)

[pretty um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m41s)

[yeah I think it I think it is built with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m44s)

[WPF if I remember correctly as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m47s)

[well so more points for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m50s)

[WPF um let's do this let's go and fix](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m52s)

[the because I assume I have to fix my](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m56s)

[pipeline real](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m57s)

[quick build](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h01m59s)

[artifacts oh no we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h02m01s)

[good](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h02m04s)

[done uh okay one of my favorite get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h02m07s)

[Kraken toys um I'm G to just delete this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h02m10s)

[Branch real quick okay I pushed it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h02m14s)

[uh uh 3395 is that the issue number how](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h03m56s)

[many years do you maintain that repo uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m00s)

[in that vein](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m12s)

[so here's the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m15s)

[question this code can throw no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m17s)

[reference exception](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m20s)

[where that is the question of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m25s)

[day mostly because I wrote code somewhat](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m28s)

[similar to this earlier this week and it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m32s)

[bit me and it threw a no ref and I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m35s)

[stared it and then I went oh I'm an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m36s)

[idiot and then I fixed it and then I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m38s)

[promptly went hang on before before I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m41s)

[completely fix it we should reformat](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m43s)

[this so that it shows up nicely uh get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m46s)

[temp cth can be null no in this case get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m49s)

[temp path was returning a non-null value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m52s)

[for me so that was perfectly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h04m54s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m02s)

[yeah uh and we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m03s)

[sorry not trying to cover it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m19s)

[for just a moment and we're gonna I will](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m29s)

[demonstrate where this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m32s)

[is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m35s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m42s)

[I'm B back output location prop](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m47s)

[and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m51s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h05m54s)

[see call back output location prop and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m02s)

[null when build out function is called](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m05s)

[correct correct Alex wonderful sorry I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m09s)

[read that a couple times but yes yes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m13s)

[that is absolutely](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m15s)

[correct ah so here here is here is the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m19s)

[kicker of what is is important to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m22s)

[understand here the when you do the uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m25s)

[initializers for your properties these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m28s)

[are invoked inside static context so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m30s)

[when um uh the class is first being uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m34s)

[initialized these things are invoked and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m39s)

[they're invoked in I believe the C spec](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m42s)

[calls it uh uh text order I.E top to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m45s)

[bottom um and so what ends up happening](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m51s)

[is it calls build output here but we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m54s)

[haven't actually initialized fallback](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h06m58s)

[output location so in the event that the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m00s)

[environment variable is not set and we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m02s)

[fall into the the null case here fall](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m05s)

[back output location. value well this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m08s)

[lazy is still null so the value throws a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m11s)

[no reference](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m14s)

[exception so yeah don't do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m15s)

[that so simple solution you move this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m19s)

[guy above this guy and it works](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m22s)

[flawlessly uh or you refactor the code](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m24s)

[so you don't have that weird ordering](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m27s)

[problem yeah it's one of those the order](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m29s)

[of operation rarely is that big of an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m32s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m37s)

[What fail to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m40s)

[compile](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m42s)

[didn't we just build it a second](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m45s)

[ago air](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m50s)

[prone yeah yeah and that could be caught](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m54s)

[by flow analysis and and it wouldn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m57s)

[shock me if certain tools or](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h07m59s)

[um uh additional checks would have](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m03s)

[caught it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m06s)

[but I didn't catch it until I hit F5 and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m08s)

[then it went boom](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m12s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m15s)

[see uh let's see is light](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m22s)

[color um is this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m29s)

[is I think what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m36s)

[this CU I if this is not set I I kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m39s)

[want it to just throw we'll do that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m42s)

[instead is that with nullable enabled](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m47s)

[yeah so the I assume the brain teaser](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m50s)

[but yes that was with Noble reference](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m52s)

[type enabled uh are you still running re](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m55s)

[sharper I don't run re sharper currently](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h08m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m03s)

[it's it's a bit of a judgment call I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m05s)

[really like its additional analysis that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m07s)

[it does but I was having a hard time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m10s)

[because resharp is a bit of a pig um it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m13s)

[likes resources and likes all the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m16s)

[resources um and so I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m19s)

[amend and push push push](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m23s)

[um and so I ended up deciding that it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m29s)

[wasn't worth the the hit](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m32s)

[to productivity to have it but again](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m35s)

[mild judgment call and insert everybody](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m39s)

[who talks about ryer are here they very](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m41s)

[much love](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m44s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m45s)

[um you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m47s)

[time uh oh uh let me let me look](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h09m50s)

[Alex yeah there there is some some](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m05s)

[refactoring ways to go about dealing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m08s)

[with that so that it doesn't get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m11s)

[um constructed that way the other the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m14s)

[other option too](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m16s)

[is I think I'm trying to remember how I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m18s)

[actually ended up refactoring the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m21s)

[fix um to some degree calling a function](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m23s)

[as a property initializer is kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m27s)

[what sets you up for those types of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m29s)

[problems because property initializers](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m32s)

[are generally designed to be small and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m34s)

[and quick like they're just supposed to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m37s)

[initialize the property if you start](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m39s)

[calling functions you kind of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m41s)

[you're you're you're doing more than I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m43s)

[think is what is originally](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m45s)

[intended um was that an open invite for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m46s)

[us to pitch wrer oh boy oh boy H yeah oh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m50s)

[hey](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h10m56s)

[open and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m01s)

[then en the flagged I want to show the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m03s)

[flags as check](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m06s)

[boxes okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m11s)

[never tried this does that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m15s)

[work it does look at](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m17s)

[that let's take a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m23s)

[look uh let's see I should probably](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m33s)

[start closing some of these down because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m36s)

[I think I've got too many open Okay so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m38s)

[uh let's see here so main window I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m44s)

[assume and okay so we got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m48s)

[Flags Okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h12m56s)

[and okay so you've got the items control](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m01s)

[Flags to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m05s)

[enumerable just saw converter declared](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m06s)

[here take a look at the converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m10s)

[uh get custom attributes goes through](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m15s)

[rips through the things pulls them](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m18s)

[out now there uh this guy](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m33s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m41s)

[okay so let's see so most of this in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m44s)

[here so it pulls the values off the enum](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m47s)

[pulls this to be able to get the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m49s)

[description attribute reads the value of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m50s)

[the description](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m54s)

[attribute inum has](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h13m56s)

[flag I don't know if you can ever get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m00s)

[this to return false with a value from](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m03s)

[get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m05s)

[values because I believe get values only](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m07s)

[get you the defined values um but goes](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m09s)

[through builds this up this is a list](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m13s)

[you return the list as an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m15s)

[innumerable](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m17s)

[interesting why as inumerable](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m19s)

[that that that interests me because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m26s)

[that's going to end up slowing things](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m28s)

[down versus just returning the list](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m29s)

[directly but regardless this is an items](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m31s)

[control content checkbox I mean this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m34s)

[looks pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m37s)

[close see what does it do when we run](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h14m39s)

[okay I must be missing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m00s)

[something what doesn't work](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m02s)

[here oh I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m07s)

[see with the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m09s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m11s)

[because this one actually is is bound](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m13s)

[properly and uh two-way binding working](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m16s)

[but code behind got it so if I go](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m21s)

[here this guy here jens's the converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m25s)

[rips through the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m28s)

[values uh Pro tip there's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m30s)

[a there's an overload to get values](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m33s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m35s)

[generic um builds a binding grabs](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m39s)

[checkbox sets the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m44s)

[checkbox uh so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m48s)

[the converter is set](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m52s)

[there this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h15m59s)

[binding hang on hang on something's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m06s)

[weird here because this binding is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m08s)

[getting a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m12s)

[converter the I simpler simpler to use](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m17s)

[the overload oh this one here uh the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m20s)

[big difference is the return](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m25s)

[type the what was not obvious before is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m27s)

[this was actually causing a cast because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m30s)

[if you look at get values because it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m32s)

[non-generic it has to return you an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m34s)

[array whereas the the generic one you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m36s)

[don't have the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m41s)

[uh the boxing of your value type it can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m42s)

[just return the actual en](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m46s)

[values so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m48s)

[uh each checkbox how is this binding](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m51s)

[working is what's confusing](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m55s)

[me because this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h16m57s)

[binding this is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m04s)

[through I'm just I confused because this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m10s)

[binding and this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m13s)

[converter this is the same conver oh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m15s)

[this is not the same converter that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m18s)

[what okay that's why I was confused okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m19s)

[so this guy here grabs the target](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m22s)

[value uh with](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m28s)

[parameter right okay bitwise bitwise](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m31s)

[math got it okay there's two converters](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m34s)

[that play I'm too stupid to read and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m37s)

[understand the difference okay okay but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m40s)

[the in this guy here the checkbox's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m44s)

[content is the description what is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m47s)

[to be the data context of each of these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m50s)

[The View model is the data](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m52s)

[context](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m55s)

[here so these](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h17m57s)

[checkboxes those](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m03s)

[checkboxes are going to be the same](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m07s)

[um data context in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m12s)

[both so then your main window view](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m16s)

[model has Flags here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m22s)

[ah got it okay got it got it got it got](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m28s)

[it got it got it got it got it that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m31s)

[makes sense okay sorry had it took me a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m33s)

[moment to grock this okay so snoop snoop](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m36s)

[the app so there is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m38s)

[a subtle change between your check](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m40s)

[boxes so we'll just pick on fault](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m44s)

[because fault is easy right if we look](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m46s)

[here this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m49s)

[gu checkbox if we look at his data](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m50s)

[context matches this guy here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m54s)

[his check](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h18m58s)

[box data context is the flag](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m00s)

[item so subtle subtle difference is what](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m03s)

[of what's Happening here because all](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m07s)

[bindings are resolved in terms of their](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m09s)

[data the the data context to the items](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m12s)

[in this case you you've created the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m15s)

[checkboxes and the data context remains](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m18s)

[your um your main window view model](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m21s)

[right so if we look here main window](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m25s)

[view model is the data context behind](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m28s)

[the checkbox whereas this checkbox here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m31s)

[your data context is your individual](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m34s)

[flag item the reason it's subtly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m36s)

[shifting is because when you use an](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m38s)

[items control](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m40s)

[each uh the data context of each item](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m42s)

[inside the items control is the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m46s)

[individual object not the the the parent](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m48s)

[one so um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m51s)

[a uh a workaround here is going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h19m56s)

[be do because I don't think you want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m01s)

[do a is selected here I think what you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m04s)

[actually want to do is mirror what you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m06s)

[did in this one here so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m12s)

[um the the the kind of the normal way to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m15s)

[work around this is with a relative](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m20s)

[Source](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m22s)

[finding uh so relative source and then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m23s)

[we can set the mode to find ancestor and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m26s)

[the ancestor type will do uh items](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m29s)

[control if you're inside a the same](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m32s)

[thing applies to like listbox list view](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m34s)

[data uh data grid Etc is often times](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m36s)

[when you want to grab a context from the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m40s)

[the parent that contained The Collection](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m43s)

[um you and in this case the parent that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m46s)

[contains the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m49s)

[collection is a little awkward because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m50s)

[of the converter in the middle but still](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m53s)

[the same idea um but generally you do a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m55s)

[fine ancestor and the default](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h20m57s)

[Constructor for relative Source if we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m00s)

[look at this guy um his he has a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m02s)

[Constructor that takes in a mode so you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m06s)

[can actually drop the word mode and just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m08s)

[pass find ancestor straight to the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m10s)

[Constructor okay so that gets us to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m12s)

[there um and then to match what you did](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m14s)

[here so uh we need the the path here to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m19s)

[be data context so the data](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m24s)

[context um of the items control is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m28s)

[to be your main window view model and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m31s)

[then the only other things that you did](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m34s)

[here is set converter and converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m36s)

[parameter so if we grab](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m38s)

[converter come across](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m40s)

[here uh let's see boom we go uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m44s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m51s)

[paste down here and we go going to get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m53s)

[long and ugly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h21m57s)

[converter that resource](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m00s)

[paste oh hush now hush now I understand](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m03s)

[yeah my parameter null probably](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m06s)

[shouldn't have done that while debugging](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m08s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m10s)

[I really want I want a setting in Visual](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m13s)

[Studio that lets me set a drag distance](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m17s)

[on these so that half a pixel doesn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m19s)

[make it jump out every freaking time](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m22s)

[okay um and then the the part that gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m25s)

[a little awkward here is you want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m29s)

[the uh the value here to be your](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m32s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m34s)

[parameter how we going to get that into](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m37s)

[the converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m39s)

[parameter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m40s)

[um inverter parameter doesn't easily](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m48s)

[take](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m51s)

[in that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m52s)

[value trying to think of an easy way to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h22m59s)

[do this because the parameter isn't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m01s)

[something that's necessarily easily](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m05s)

[bound](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m10s)

[how do we get there that gets us the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m15s)

[main window is this is ultimately just a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m17s)

[flag item that's coming in and the flag](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m20s)

[item has a selected in content and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m22s)

[really we don't need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m25s)

[either we don't really need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m28s)

[either don't need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m36s)

[either because even though you built up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m39s)

[these flag items inside of this um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m41s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m48s)

[um yeah yeah ideally get rid of flag](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h23m57s)

[item okay well](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m00s)

[let's do this I'm G to while I'm in here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m05s)

[I'm just going to I'm just I'm I'm going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m09s)

[to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m11s)

[play](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m12s)

[um so I I uh the the way I've done this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m16s)

[before is the description lives at the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m20s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m24s)

[and but you still have to reach](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m29s)

[up and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m37s)

[the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m40s)

[oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m51s)

[minute wait a minute wait a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m53s)

[minute well we still have to get it in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m55s)

[there is the problem how do we get it in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m57s)

[there because we have access to both](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h24m59s)

[bits okay I'm going to do this I'm going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m04s)

[to do this a little differently then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m10s)

[we're going to do this this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m18s)

[multi because I want to have two](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m21s)

[values um and then yeah uh Implement](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m24s)

[pretty please and we're going to do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m28s)

[this we're going to go here and we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m32s)

[going to go this we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m35s)

[okay we're going to move this move](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m39s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m43s)

[um interesting that you're caching this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m52s)

[here whatever not gonna not going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m56s)

[worry about it at the moment okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h25m58s)

[um so what we want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m01s)

[is uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m05s)

[if values oh and we can oh please tell](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m07s)

[me is this latest](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m10s)

[yes yes we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m12s)

[this uh you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m16s)

[in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m23s)

[uh value U int](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m24s)

[here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m40s)

[okay uh and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m49s)

[then I don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m51s)

[know or actually we should probably do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m54s)

[something like uh dependency property](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h26m56s)

[unset which is a fancy way of saying no](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m00s)

[okay and then this one here we need to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m03s)

[go the other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m04s)

[direction and break this guy back apart](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m07s)

[um this is going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m12s)

[be so on the convert back is going to be](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m19s)

[on the check State](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m23s)

[changed yeah](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m34s)

[so this was Target](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m37s)

[type](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m42s)

[uh because the value going through is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m49s)

[going to end up](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m53s)

[being uh let's see and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h27m58s)

[then](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m05s)

[uh I'm I'm getting this backwards](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m08s)

[I'm getting this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m12s)

[backwards am I thinking so hard on](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m15s)

[this lagged fled enum coming](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m19s)

[through](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m25s)

[okay let's let's let's one step at a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m27s)

[time one step at a time one step at a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m30s)

[time so we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m33s)

[do rather than editing all this stuff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m35s)

[we're going to leave this alone and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m38s)

[we're going to do a new one](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m41s)

[um okay do that boom then we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m52s)

[do some of what you have here we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h28m57s)

[going to throw away the rest because I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m00s)

[only](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m02s)

[want](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m05s)

[turn](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m10s)

[my enom get rid of that we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m16s)

[just straight return](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m19s)

[enum okay we just do that and return](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m29s)

[it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m33s)

[uh FY property unset value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m39s)

[okay do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m45s)

[that go here and we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m47s)

[go uh converters enum values X key gets](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m51s)

[enum values done done okay this guy here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h29m57s)

[becomes enum values okay that gets us](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m02s)

[through there this now becomes uh the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m06s)

[name space of that guy is it just so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m11s)

[he's just at the root so it's local I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m14s)

[think is probably where it is system](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m17s)

[Flags Okay so this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m20s)

[guy uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m24s)

[binding and then usually what I would do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m26s)

[here is uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m29s)

[uh resource](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m33s)

[enum](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m36s)

[description we go back](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m38s)

[uh let's see this is where we take the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m43s)

[other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m45s)

[one class](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m46s)

[en](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m49s)

[description we do this we go Auto](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h30m56s)

[Implement for me pretty](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m00s)

[please interface and then this is where](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m02s)

[we're going to take another little bit](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m04s)

[of your code well we'll take it all for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m07s)

[the moment](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m09s)

[uh we're going to go here we're going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m14s)

[do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m16s)

[enum get type get flags](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m18s)

[attribute um and](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m22s)

[then uh let's see get](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m28s)

[field](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m39s)

[do this because we don't need the four](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m42s)

[each want to grab that thing don't need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m44s)

[this we don't need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h31m51s)

[um think those are](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m04s)

[equivalent uh dependency property unset](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m09s)

[value let's see and then we don't need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m12s)

[any of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m15s)

[this um we can do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m17s)

[if yeah that'll work thanks co-pilot](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m23s)

[appreciate](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m25s)

[that um okay so we go here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m27s)

[here back to here and we go up here we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m31s)

[go uh converters enum](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m36s)

[description](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m39s)

[you come down here and we go enum](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m41s)

[description okay so that gets us to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m44s)

[there I'm going to just cut this for the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m47s)

[moment I just want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m51s)

[much works for](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h32m53s)

[me okay that I believe looks correct](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m02s)

[obviously the is checked isn't bound but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m06s)

[that gets us](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m09s)

[okay display wise we're](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m11s)

[fine okay now we put this back so now](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m13s)

[what we need to do is we inside of this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m17s)

[data template we need access to two](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m19s)

[things we need access to the um the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m22s)

[datab bound property](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m26s)

[that uh uh this guy is leveraging and in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m30s)

[this case the this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m34s)

[somewhat this line here is what's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m37s)

[somewhat difficult to draw directly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m39s)

[represent in zaml because even though](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m41s)

[you can assign here converter parameter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m43s)

[can't be it's just an auto property it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m46s)

[nothing that's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m49s)

[bindable which is what makes this mildly](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m52s)

[interesting mildly interesting it's](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h33m56s)

[interesting trying to think if there's a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m00s)

[clean cleaner way other than the multi](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m03s)

[value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m05s)

[binding because inside of the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m05s)

[zaml um we want want to use both the the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m08s)

[data context of the items control as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m12s)

[well as the the this for our binding](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m15s)

[because you'll know this binding here is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m19s)

[implicitly just doing um the targeting](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m21s)

[Uh current context which is path period](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m26s)

[which is the default which is why we can](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m29s)

[omit it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m32s)

[um that gets us to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m36s)

[there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m39s)

[and actually I](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m41s)

[think you've got the default setup](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m44s)

[oh I think if you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m53s)

[do this that'll get you because that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h34m56s)

[should be the default as](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m00s)

[well that binding is going to fail but](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m01s)

[that's okay oh no reference not okay](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m04s)

[because it's going to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m07s)

[crash](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m09s)

[en](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m12s)

[converter is there a cleaner way of](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m14s)

[doing this I don't think there](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m16s)

[is because you actually want to bind not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m22s)

[to data context you want to](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m26s)

[bind CU on one side you want the](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m36s)

[property on your main window view view](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m38s)

[model and on the other side you](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m42s)

[want is there an easier way to do this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m47s)

[without needing to do some wacky stuff](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m50s)

[with a multibinding because that's going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m53s)

[to be pulling an array in and out just](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m55s)

[for the purposes of having a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m57s)

[bound parameter on a converter which](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h35m59s)

[feels very](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m02s)

[very](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m04s)

[yucky](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m09s)

[I don't see an easier way of doing it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m11s)

[though I don't I don't see an easier way](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m13s)

[of doing this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m15s)

[so uh we go to element syntax because](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m17s)

[you can't do a multi-binding in](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m20s)

[attribute syntax so we go uh checkbox do](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m22s)

[is checked it's going to hate me for a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m28s)

[moment we do a](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m30s)

[multibinding](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m34s)

[yeah that is creepy and very](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m39s)

[close Okay so the first binding is going](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m43s)

[to be because this data context is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m47s)

[pointed up at items](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m49s)

[control um and I believe what we want is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m53s)

[items control Dot and whatever the name](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m57s)

[of your property is here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h36m59s)

[Flags](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m06s)

[Flags Okay and then the second uh](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m07s)

[binding is going to be the the current](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m10s)

[value so path period again we could even](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m13s)

[go as far as to just do that won't make](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m16s)

[a difference um and then we need](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m19s)

[a um our multi-converter](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m23s)

[uh okay so this is mask so this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m29s)

[is I'm going to get rid of Target value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m33s)

[for the moment because usually you don't](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m35s)

[want generally in your value converters](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m38s)

[they they should be um have no side](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m41s)

[effects from being](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m45s)

[invoked](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m46s)

[so let's see so to know if this is](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m48s)

[checked mask is our current one and so](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m56s)

[is here this will return either a true](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h37m58s)

[or a false so this value coming in here](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m02s)

[is going to be if value is bull](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m06s)

[um oh but you don't have the whole](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m15s)

[object to set it](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m18s)

[up on the way back because on the way](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m21s)

[back all you have is the Boolean that](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m24s)

[came in not](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m26s)

[the side](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m30s)

[parameter because in this case we've](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m38s)

[lost what the current one is because we](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m41s)

[have to go back to the the other](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m44s)

[value](https://youtu.be/uAQL3I336SM?t=03h38m49s)
