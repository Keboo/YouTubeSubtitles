[Build and Ignite Um Build is slightly](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h00m29s)

[more developer focused Ignite is a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h00m32s)

[little more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h00m34s)

[um I don't know what to call it CIS](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h00m36s)

[interested in it Um there is a new video](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m30s)

[out on uh Getraken's YouTube that uh I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m33s)

[produced for them uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m38s)

[the whoop the the the GitGY showdown So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m40s)

[I did a video of this um couple years](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m44s)

[ago uh where it was you know comparing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m48s)

[Git Kraken to a bunch of other GitGY](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m51s)

[clients Again I'm a heavily biased](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m53s)

[source Get Kraken is obviously my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m55s)

[favorite Um for anybody who has watched](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m57s)

[this stuff I love it I uh think it is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h01m59s)

[awesome They asked for an updated](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m02s)

[version um adding a few additional](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m04s)

[clients in there uh short version uh if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m06s)

[you'd like to go take a look at it I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m09s)

[still like Git Kraken Um and we'll take](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m11s)

[a look at some of the reasons here in a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m14s)

[moment Um but there are there was a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m15s)

[couple interesting things in there that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m17s)

[I I was unprepared for Uh Git Butler is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m20s)

[a very interesting client that kind of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m24s)

[it m it made my head spin a little Um](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m26s)

[but it it has the potential of being](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m29s)

[pretty cool I didn't personally think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m31s)

[that I was ready to use it or switch](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m34s)

[over to it but it it's an interesting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m36s)

[concept So if you if you want to go see](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m38s)

[more get Kraken's YouTube video Uh check](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m40s)

[it out Um I I was told uh aim for 20](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m43s)

[minutes So I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m46s)

[uh clearly am bad at following](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m48s)

[directions](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m50s)

[Um but they published it anyway So you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m52s)

[know my my 20 minute target ended up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m55s)

[being a little bit more I I tried to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m58s)

[expand last time I I didn't feel like I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h02m59s)

[gave a lot of the clients their due](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m02s)

[share in terms of kind of walking](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m04s)

[through some of the stuff Um some of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m06s)

[them had a lot more to show than others](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m08s)

[Some of them are really just straight](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m10s)

[get clients and that's it So but yeah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m12s)

[short version If you want the summary](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m15s)

[you can always jump to the uh the final](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m16s)

[thoughts at the end if you are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m18s)

[interested in kind of how things closed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m20s)

[out Um that is not the final thoughts is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m21s)

[not completely accurate](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m25s)

[Uh where does he get to the actual final](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m28s)

[thoughts yeah So if you want the actual](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m31s)

[final thoughts](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m32s)

[um somewhere around 4536 when it goes](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m34s)

[full screen my face that's where the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m38s)

[actual final thoughts are I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m39s)

[the auto things it it merged the last](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m41s)

[couple together it looks like So but on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m45s)

[the note of Git Kraken so get Kraken](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m49s)

[released](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m52s)

[11.0 and it is awesome Well I think it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m54s)

[awesome So specifically you'll note](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h03m57s)

[there is something here and and I want I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m00s)

[want you to pay very close attention to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m02s)

[this symbol here This is the happy magic](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m04s)

[button Okay Uh so get cracking AI and so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m06s)

[obviously everybody is uh throwing in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m10s)

[all uh excited on AI related stuff and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m14s)

[so this is uh get Kraken bringing their](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m17s)

[own flavor of it Um one of the really](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m19s)

[nice things about it if we uh dive in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m21s)

[and look at the Git Kraken AI So is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m24s)

[scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll blah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m26s)

[blah blah ignoring this ignoring this Um](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m28s)

[so by default you don't need to bring](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m31s)

[your own key right by default uh they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m34s)

[use their own server that feeds out to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m38s)

[Gemini Um and so there is no API key](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m40s)

[required Now with that said uh at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m44s)

[present they have open I let me try that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m47s)

[one again Open AAI and enthropic So if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m50s)

[you would prefer to bring your own key](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m53s)

[that is possible Um I will also mention](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m55s)

[this feature is pro and higher SKs So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h04m58s)

[this is something that because there is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m02s)

[some cost associated with it Um the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m04s)

[pricing model is something that should](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m07s)

[be uh noted So you'll note the free](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m08s)

[column is over here on the left and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m11s)

[you'll note this blank section where the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m13s)

[AI is on the other ones That's not there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m15s)

[But the other kind of cool thing here is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m17s)

[the tokens are per week right so per](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m19s)

[week per user depending on uh how many](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m22s)

[you have with the idea being that I if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m24s)

[it's like monthly and you run out you're](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m28s)

[then kind of just dead in the water for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m31s)

[the rest of the month Whereas this it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m33s)

[going to reset every week And so it's it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m35s)

[feels more encouraging to just use it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m38s)

[right it's it's less one of those oh you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m40s)

[know I've got like you know those people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m42s)

[in video games where they find out oh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m44s)

[this is a limited resource and they just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m46s)

[hoard it like nah this is this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m47s)

[something that's going to reset every](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m50s)

[week so uh use it right it feels feels](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m51s)

[video gamey to me in that regard which](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m54s)

[is which is kind of nice](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m56s)

[u but these are AI tokens so for people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h05m59s)

[who are unfamiliar with this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m01s)

[conceptually just kind of count words](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m02s)

[right the more you type the the longer](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m04s)

[the text is the more it's going to have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m06s)

[to process and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m08s)

[um but there are there's a lot of coming](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m11s)

[soon you'll note they've got the preview](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m14s)

[tag on a lot of these so this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m16s)

[something that is under active](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m18s)

[development And in typical getit kraken](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m19s)

[features set right they they often push](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m22s)

[things monthly So there's only so much](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m25s)

[you can get in between releases And it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m27s)

[usually one of those things that's going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m30s)

[to build and build So I would expect to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m31s)

[see a lot more in this area because you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m33s)

[know this is the cool new hotness So it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m34s)

[uh we will we will take a look](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m37s)

[specifically at a couple of these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m39s)

[because they're so easy to show off](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m40s)

[right but you got commit message](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m42s)

[generation and explain commits I did not](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m44s)

[think that the explain commits would be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m46s)

[as useful as as it has turned out to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m50s)

[for me I it probably was a little bit](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m52s)

[around some of the tasks that I was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m56s)

[given but I I had to evaluate some code](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h06m57s)

[bases that I was not familiar](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m00s)

[with and it was remarkably nice to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m02s)

[able to just say "Yeah write the summary](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m06s)

[of this for me." Because that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m08s)

[effectively what the explain commits is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m09s)

[is summarize some commits for me Right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m12s)

[so for example right like I've got this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m14s)

[commit here There's a bunch of stuff in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m16s)

[here It's like okay well what what did](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m18s)

[this do hit explain right and for people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m20s)

[worried the first time you click this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m22s)

[button it does prompt you and say hey](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m24s)

[just so you know we are sending code out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m26s)

[to an AI agent or make sure you you know](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m27s)

[the the thing that you're doing it is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m30s)

[doing it And you'll note here this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m32s)

[written in Spanish I do not speak](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m35s)

[Spanish but that that's the other cool](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m39s)

[part right so there are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m41s)

[um for example you can do things like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m44s)

[this custom instructions And as far as I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m47s)

[can tell these appear to just get tacked](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m50s)

[on onto a prompt that gets sent out to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m52s)

[get Kraken's API that is then fed into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m56s)

[Gemini as far as I can tell I don't know](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h07m58s)

[but if you were to hypothetically sniff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m01s)

[the traffic going between your client](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m03s)

[and their server you might see the the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m05s)

[full prompt with the custom instructions](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m08s)

[tacked on at the end probably right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m10s)

[after a dollar sign Hint hint Um but the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m12s)

[other nice thing is if you're wondering](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m16s)

[what your usage details are they're just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m17s)

[right there right so it's like oh that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m19s)

[kind of cool And you can turn this this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m22s)

[sucker on and off if this is not right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m24s)

[Or if you want to go with the bring your](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m26s)

[own key model you can drop in here And](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m28s)

[then you can actually you know pick out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m30s)

[what what you'd rather go against](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h08m32s)

[often when I'm reviewing a PR that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m37s)

[what I care about is categories of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m39s)

[changes right that's the order I want to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m41s)

[review them in So hopefully somebody](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m43s)

[watches this and hopefully somebody](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m46s)

[steals that idea and builds the tool I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m47s)

[would love love love to buy that tool](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h11m49s)

[for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m31s)

[are we doing tonight what are we doing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m35s)

[tonight okay so I am on a quest I I am](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m37s)

[on a quest and and you all get to come](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m40s)

[along on the quest with me So there has](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m43s)

[been a Rick uh a thing on Velopac that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m46s)

[has plagued us for a while and I think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m49s)

[I've mentioned this before is an MSI](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m51s)

[based Wix installer and we did a stream](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m54s)

[on this a while back and kind of scrap](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m55s)

[that work and yada yada yada for for a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h12m58s)

[variety of reasons Right we are back on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m00s)

[it and this time I've got a more or less](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m02s)

[working proof of concept Right So the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m06s)

[the idea here is we want to actually gen](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m09s)

[a real MSI installer not the stupid MSI](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m12s)

[installer tool](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m16s)

[that Cloud Squirrel used to do and that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m17s)

[we we brought in and we're probably](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m20s)

[about to obsolete it just as quickly as](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m22s)

[we brought it in Right that's that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m23s)

[going away We want a real MSI that just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m26s)

[installs once doesn't do this weird](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m28s)

[registry hacky stuff That's yucky yucky](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m30s)

[yucky We don't like that We want a real](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m33s)

[MSI that gives the user the option of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m35s)

[installing either per user or all users](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m38s)

[It's an MSI so CIS admins if they want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m41s)

[to do something funky with it go to town](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m43s)

[right that's going to kind of be off](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m45s)

[We're for V1 we're kind of nixing the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m48s)

[idea of much extensibility That may come](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m51s)

[in the future but for now we're like we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m54s)

[just need something in and working that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m55s)

[gen a reasonably looking MSI that we can](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h13m57s)

[play with like that is that is the V1](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m01s)

[that we are looking to have here Right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m03s)

[so that's what we're going for and we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m06s)

[are close We are very very close So uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m08s)

[and I apologize because I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m12s)

[showing a private repo for this So but](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m14s)

[it's my repo so we can get away with](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m16s)

[this So this is technically a repo I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m18s)

[have for running full endtoend tests for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m21s)

[Velopc Um it does it from the client all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m23s)

[the way up to our backend SAS and all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m26s)

[forward and back and up and down Right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m29s)

[So it does some stuff it has some stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m31s)

[but that's not what we're interested in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m33s)

[The whole reason why I picked this one](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m34s)

[is it's got a very simple console app](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m36s)

[that doesn't do a whole lot Um and more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m38s)

[importantly that console app is already](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m42s)

[packed with Vellopac Um and so it makes](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m43s)

[it quick and easy for me to play around](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m46s)

[with it because I have copied in some of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m48s)

[its publishy bits uh to where I want it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m50s)

[to be And then I've made this simple](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m54s)

[installer folder which this is a Wix v5](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m56s)

[setup right and then what I am doing is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h14m59s)

[when I get it working here I then](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m02s)

[migrated it to the main Velopac repo](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m04s)

[because this is a like me testing a an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m06s)

[MSI build is about that long here and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m11s)

[that's a lot quicker than doing it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m13s)

[inside of Velpac So we get so I'm just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m14s)

[trying to figure out how to get the Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m17s)

[to behave the way I want here and then](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m18s)

[we bring the stuff over Right This is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m20s)

[using the whole MS build stuff and all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m23s)

[of that things inside of the actual](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m24s)

[um VEL pack repository Like if I go and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m28s)

[look at my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m30s)

[uh view all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m33s)

[branches Yeah Oh it's called MSI not Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m38s)

[Right If I go and look at what is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m41s)

[actually um over here we look at the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m44s)

[vendor What we are actually bringing in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m48s)

[instead is we are just going um we are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m50s)

[bringing in the the Wix exe uh tool and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m54s)

[we're just shelling out to that because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m58s)

[I I did a MS bin log on what was going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h15m59s)

[on with the the net build stuff and the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m05s)

[MS build integration though nice isn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m08s)

[adding a lot of value for what Velopac](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m11s)

[needs and more importantly we would like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m14s)

[to at some point kind of decouple](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m17s)

[Velopac from MS build Not saying that we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m20s)

[won't have like the the Vellopac.build](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m23s)

[project That's I think a a thing that we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m25s)

[absolutely want to have but we don't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m28s)

[want to require somebody who's not using](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m30s)

[.NET to install.NET just to run our tool](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m32s)

[right we want the tool to be able to run](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m36s)

[without .NET That way if you know if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m38s)

[you're building say a C++ application](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m41s)

[you're like I don't have .NET installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m43s)

[Why do I need this .NET global tool it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m45s)

[like well you don't need a NET global](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m46s)

[tool You just need this CLI tool and it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m48s)

[will do the needful Right so that that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m51s)

[kind of the the idea there Not to say](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m53s)

[like .NET's a secondary citizen or any](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m54s)

[of that like no no I I still love my net](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m57s)

[It's still my favorite But there is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h16m59s)

[something to be said about not having](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m01s)

[that be the only delivery mechanism It's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m03s)

[currently all we've got But long term we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m06s)

[would like to to push out the VPK tool](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m09s)

[onto various managers so that people can](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m11s)

[install it more easily uh without um it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m14s)

[being real problematic It's like oh I've](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m18s)

[got to install this other tool chain](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m20s)

[Like I always hate when I have to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m21s)

[install you know node and npm just to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m23s)

[get somebody else's tool It's like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m25s)

[h I don't like that It just feels yucky](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m28s)

[right i like windgit install That's what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m31s)

[I like And so we we kind of want to move](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m33s)

[that directiony a little bit right and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m36s)

[then you know brew or whatever for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m38s)

[insert your package manager of choice So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m40s)

[we'll we'll probably try to push it out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m42s)

[on all of them because VPK runs](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m44s)

[crossplat We want to be in the package](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m45s)

[managers on all said systems yada yada](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m48s)

[yada Right now global tools are a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m50s)

[convenient way of doing that because we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m53s)

[can do it once and it just goes to all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m55s)

[of them Long term we want it to go to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m57s)

[all of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h17m59s)

[them Okay So and more importantly inside](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m01s)

[of the the Vellopac stuff if anybody](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m05s)

[wants to check out my branch it's not](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m07s)

[doing anything overly advanced It's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m09s)

[literally just building up a big string](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m10s)

[of the XML bits and then writing it to a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m13s)

[file and calling Wix.exe on it which is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m16s)

[functionally all this is doing right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m19s)

[there's a there's a little bit extra](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m21s)

[that happens here with this net build](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m23s)

[based upon um if you've got like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m25s)

[extensions installed There's a little](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m27s)

[bit of magic that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m30s)

[the the the Wix tooling does there to to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m31s)

[appropriately pass in extensions but](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m35s)

[it's not that much It's really not So I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m37s)

[was like I don't need to add extra stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m40s)

[if I don't want to I didn't Um okay So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m43s)

[if we run this guy here what we have let](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m47s)

[me I don't know why I keep](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m51s)

[opening why I keep opening up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h18m56s)

[the other thing So if I run this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m00s)

[installer right and this is me just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m04s)

[playing around with with mcking with it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m06s)

[right to be able to get things in the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m09s)

[and things like localization and that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m11s)

[that that will be forthcoming Again we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m14s)

[kind of scrapped it for V1 because we're](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m16s)

[like we don't have localization now We](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m17s)

[want it but ship first questions later](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m20s)

[So this is one of the first things that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m23s)

[we'd like to change So this is fine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m24s)

[We'll probably going to change the logo](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m27s)

[and whatnot in here um to something](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m28s)

[that's like we don't want people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m31s)

[thinking that they're installing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m32s)

[Vellopac We want them thinking that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m33s)

[they're installing the needed app So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m35s)

[there's some there's some branding work](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m37s)

[but I was putting in custom images just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m38s)

[to prove that I could right and so this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m41s)

[here is one of the things that we want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m43s)

[to change is we don't really want it to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m45s)

[be a folder picker We really just want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m46s)

[current user all users because there's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m49s)

[kind of um a handful of cases that we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m51s)

[expect that exist There's the let the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m54s)

[user pick which is where we're going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m58s)

[give them the two radio buttons And then](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h19m59s)

[there's the install my app uh for all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m01s)

[users install my app for current users](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m04s)

[but those two are kind of developer](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m06s)

[controlled And then there's the third](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m08s)

[option where the developer can say well](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m10s)

[let my user pick I don't care Right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m11s)

[because sometimes the developer wants to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m13s)

[set it and sometimes the developer is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m15s)

[like "No whatever." Right let the user](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m16s)

[can do whatever they want Right so we're](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m19s)

[gonna we're going to give I think those](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m22s)

[three options inside of the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m24s)

[um in inside of the VPK uh tool to let](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m27s)

[people set it But that's what we need to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m32s)

[change here because right now this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m34s)

[just going into here right it's got some](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m35s)

[read me stuff then it does an install](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m38s)

[And so my game plan because right now uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m39s)

[cancel Yeah Yeah Cancel Because right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m44s)

[now the way this thing is set up is I I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m46s)

[have brought in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m49s)

[um a a Wix UI And let me go grab that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m52s)

[Oh Wix UI Firebase Gotten really good](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h20m56s)

[with their docs](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m01s)

[Um oh Fire Giant See I'm so good with](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m05s)

[our docs I can't even get the name](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m08s)

[right Right So I had initially started](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m10s)

[uh with something that resembled this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m14s)

[one here Wix UI installed And what I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m17s)

[realized is they actually have this Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m20s)

[UI advanced And more importantly this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m23s)

[one has a dialogue that already has two](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m25s)

[radio buttons one for current user and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m26s)

[one for um all users right so GitHub Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m29s)

[And this this is where things are going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m34s)

[to get real yucky I like you are not](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m35s)

[going to hear a lot of nice things out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m38s)

[of my mouth about Wix I'm sorry Wix but](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m39s)

[the reason people hate you is because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m42s)

[the Windows installer stuff is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m45s)

[complicated and you don't make it easier](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m46s)

[You just surface it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m48s)

[Um which is why Velopac will be awesome](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m51s)

[So if we go in I believe it's here and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h21m56s)

[then let's see I think it's extensions](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m00s)

[and then it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m02s)

[UI and then Wix extension](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m03s)

[Nope It here There we are So if we come](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m07s)

[in here there's this Wix scope dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m11s)

[right and this is the one that the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m15s)

[advanced UI ends up doing right and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m16s)

[you'll see there's two radio buttons](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m18s)

[It's got the the per machine and per](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m20s)

[user folder It's like perfect this this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m22s)

[is the dialogue I want And I initially](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m25s)

[ran down the idea of oh I know what I'll](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m28s)

[do I'll just bring this dialogue into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m30s)

[the current flow that I'm doing because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m32s)

[there's a a step down here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m35s)

[uh because they show you how to add and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m38s)

[removing dialogues from a dialogue set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m40s)

[I'm like that's exactly what I want to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m42s)

[do I'd like to add one of these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m43s)

[dialogues to a dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m44s)

[set right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m46s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m49s)

[so the short version is adding and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m53s)

[removing dialogues is insanely](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m56s)

[complicated Like it it Wix is great if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h22m59s)

[you fall into the the perfect category](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m02s)

[where this aligns and the moment you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m04s)

[want to do something custom the answer](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m05s)

[is literally go and copy this file out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m07s)

[of the repo into your codebase I was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m10s)

[like "Oh like I hate when I tell people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m13s)

[to do that with the material design](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m15s)

[project for like a control template](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m17s)

[where it's like yeah what you want to do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m18s)

[is so custom you really need to copy the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m20s)

[control template in and and tweak it to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m22s)

[suit your needs right?" But I usually](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m24s)

[like there's a level of customization](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m26s)

[where it's like no you know people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m28s)

[really should be able to you know do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m30s)

[some basic stuff here This feels basic](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m32s)

[and the immediate thing is bail It's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m34s)

[like oh dear heavens Thank you Wix I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m38s)

[appreciate your immediate confidence in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m40s)

[it Right So it's it's copy the file out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m43s)

[rename the IDs remove in this case the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m45s)

[publish elements of of what it's going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m49s)

[through and doing and trying to make](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m51s)

[that work Um all to to bring it back in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m53s)

[So I tried to bring the dialogue in and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m56s)

[this is where this is where things get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h23m58s)

[extra hard Extra hard right so you'll](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m00s)

[note this install scope dialogue right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m03s)

[if we go here and we look down at the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m04s)

[Wix UI advanced which is where this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m06s)

[thing is right there's a few there's a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m08s)

[few things in here that are real key to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m11s)

[note](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m13s)

[right like those are kind of big deals](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m14s)

[in my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m18s)

[opinion right so uh and this line here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m19s)

[is the other key one This set is still](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m23s)

[in active development I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m26s)

[like this sucks right like this is not](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m29s)

[what I want Like I want it stable and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m33s)

[useful and running and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m37s)

[h like use at your own](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m40s)

[risk So the thing I want is not in a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m44s)

[done state or is in an active and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m48s)

[fudgeable state and that doesn't give me](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m51s)

[a lot of it it it explains why I was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m53s)

[having some some trouble The other thing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m56s)

[that gets worse right is I am looking at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h24m58s)

[Maine You should not look at main right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m01s)

[in the case of using 5.0.2 which is what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m04s)

[we pulled in you should actually look at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m07s)

[the 5.0.2 branch because this is in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m09s)

[active development These are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m12s)

[different And I learned this the hard](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m14s)

[way It was very frustrating Um I did not](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m16s)

[realize that they had changed I did not](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m20s)

[realize I was looking at Maine and I was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m22s)

[very confused for a while why things](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m23s)

[weren't working until I went "Boy that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m25s)

[air message just doesn't align with what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m28s)

[I'm seeing Something seems off Something](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m30s)

[is very very wrong Then I went "Oh I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m32s)

[an idiot." Okay Okay Learn to use the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m35s)

[GitHub you [ __ ] And so after my my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m41s)

[small pep talk uh I I then went through](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m44s)

[and did this So I think what we're going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m47s)

[to try to do I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m50s)

[think we'll see how this goes I had](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m52s)

[tried to just bring this dialogue into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h25m55s)

[inform him that he should pub post it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h28m42s)

[because I gave him the the title I am](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h28m44s)

[going to do the next talk and it is what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h28m46s)

[day is it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h28m49s)

[um they go every other month So it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h28m52s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h28m58s)

[I I can't remember whether that lands us](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m00s)

[in May or June It might land us in June](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m03s)

[It might land us on June 3rd I'll see So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m06s)

[regardless there's there's many weeks](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m09s)

[between now and then But the talk is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m10s)

[going to be on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m12s)

[uh we'll call it I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m14s)

[exactly how I titled it but it's like uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m16s)

[C through the ages right so it's going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m19s)

[to start at C# v1 and kind of walk](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m21s)

[through each of the versions I plan to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m24s)

[go from C# one to C# 14 which you will](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m26s)

[note is V next Um and the added bonus is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m29s)

[the build conference happens between now](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m33s)

[and then So everything that gets shown](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m35s)

[at the build conference I can include in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m37s)

[the talk which](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m39s)

[um but C# is developed in the open so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m41s)

[there's not really that much like C#](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m44s)

[itself isn't that secretive if anybody](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m47s)

[wants to go out look at the C# lang repo](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m49s)

[like you can see what features they're](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m51s)

[looking at and what stuff is likely to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m53s)

[drop in C# 14 Um so there there's all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m55s)

[that kind of cool stuff that is coming](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h29m59s)

[So I plan on kind of do hitting C#](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m01s)

[version highlights because I found that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m03s)

[a lot of people get confused on features](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m05s)

[and why they exist And I think showing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m08s)

[them chronologically kind of helps make](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m10s)

[some sense of that So uh I I plan on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m12s)

[putting that together Uh what version](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m16s)

[are we on now i thought it was 10 Uh so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m18s)

[close Uh we are on C 13 at the moment](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m22s)

[Net uh net 9 is current NET 10 is next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m27s)

[And so that's that that is an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m31s)

[unfortunate thing At some point I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m33s)

[totally anticipate Microsoft just saying](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m34s)

[screw it and making the version numbers](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m36s)

[match Um but there is a subtle](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m37s)

[difference I if we talknet that's like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m41s)

[BCL version and all that stuff versus if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m44s)

[we talk just C# language features that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m47s)

[C# 14 is coming up uh in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m50s)

[November because they release it all the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m53s)

[time But yes you were right Currently](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m55s)

[uh .NET 10 C# 14 is the the V-Next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h30m59s)

[version Um unless they do something](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m04s)

[weird with their numbering but if if we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m06s)

[just do increment then yes that that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m08s)

[where we're going to land But yeah so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m10s)

[good conference really enjoyed getting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m12s)

[to uh meet up with a bunch of people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m14s)

[which that I I think that's the part](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m17s)

[that I enjoy the most is being able to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m19s)

[like sit down and just chat with a bunch](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m22s)

[of uh MVPs which is usually really fun](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m25s)

[It it it's always a little weird because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m30s)

[they there's times where they so they do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m33s)

[like these social events right and this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m35s)

[may come as a shock to some people but a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m38s)

[lot of developers are not known for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m41s)

[their social skills Um and this could](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m43s)

[not be more apparent than at like some](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m45s)

[of these conferences And so I always I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m47s)

[always get a good laugh out of it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m50s)

[Like I don't think I'm completely](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m52s)

[antisocial but I will say by the end of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m55s)

[a long day of conferencing I am very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h31m57s)

[interested in not being social And so I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m00s)

[might be a little less social than I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m03s)

[otherwise otherwise might be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m05s)

[Um pull up I did have one cool picture](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m09s)

[to show if I can grab](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m11s)

[it I I did get I I did get like most](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m15s)

[places you weren't allowed to take](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m19s)

[pictures for obvious reasons](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m20s)

[Um except for in designated spots Uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m24s)

[sure fine But here is here's a picture](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m28s)

[of me with someone people might](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m33s)

[recognize That's Scott Guthrie If you're](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m36s)

[unfamiliar with who Scott Guthrie is you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m38s)

[should go look him up But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m40s)

[yeah I got to get a picture with Scott](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m42s)

[Guthrie So that was kind of cool But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m44s)

[yeah um because normally getting a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m47s)

[picture with Scott Guthrie is usually](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m50s)

[very challenging and the long lines are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m51s)

[very long At MVP Summit the lines are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m53s)

[still long but not quite as long as they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m55s)

[otherwise might be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h32m57s)

[Oh and now Paint.NET wants to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m00s)

[update Yeah So that that was kind of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m03s)

[cool Um able to like say hi shake his](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m05s)

[hand get a picture That was kind of cool](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m09s)

[Uh I'd be the person dressed in black](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m13s)

[trying to hide in the darkest corner](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m16s)

[with my laptop and a beer See you would](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m17s)

[have fit right in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m20s)

[Izzy You would have fit right in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m21s)

[perfectly because I I will say some MVPs](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m23s)

[are are quite social So one of the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m26s)

[things that people often associate](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m28s)

[Microsoft MVP with like tech geniuses](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m31s)

[and that kind of thing it's actually and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m34s)

[this is hopefully I don't get in trouble](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m37s)

[for saying this um being an MVP has](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m39s)

[nothing to do with competency right like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m42s)

[you could](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m44s)

[be less competent but there are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m46s)

[Microsoft MVPs for like Office and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m49s)

[Windows and other things right and so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m52s)

[sometimes you'll be sitting in a talk](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m55s)

[and you'll hear get a question that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m56s)

[comes out that it at least from a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h33m58s)

[developer perspective is like a very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m00s)

[novice question right because some of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m02s)

[these MVPs the concept of like JSON and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m04s)

[XML is a foreign concept to them But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m06s)

[it's like you have to remember these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m09s)

[people may not be like dev technology](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m11s)

[MVPs They they might be for for Windows](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m14s)

[or Office and so some of this stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m17s)

[might be brand new to them So there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m18s)

[there is a little bit about that because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m20s)

[it's more about um influence than it is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m22s)

[around competency Now you you obviously](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m25s)

[can't be completely incompetent Um but](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m27s)

[having influence in in areas is going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m31s)

[score more highly for uh a Microsoft MVP](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m35s)

[than otherwise So there's a bit of that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m38s)

[And on that note I am aware that my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m41s)

[YouTube uploads are failing I Yeah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m43s)

[Google hosed me again So I have to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m46s)

[completely redo what I was doing which](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m49s)

[is just exciting me to death](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m50s)

[Uh I have no influence either Yes But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m53s)

[you're at least interesting Um and you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m56s)

[you you do come with a variety of very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h34m58s)

[useful skills I will say that And on the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m01s)

[note of those useful](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m04s)

[skills making wicks not suck U but I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m05s)

[don't think that's actually possible So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m09s)

[I think that's that's just a lost cause](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m11s)

[I think what I want to do here is I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m13s)

[contemplate when I was at my hotel of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m33s)

[going you know I wonder wonder if I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m35s)

[here were fast enough to stream And then](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m39s)

[I realized I'm like even if the internet](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m41s)

[speeds were fast enough at the hotel to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m44s)

[stream I don't like when I travel I have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m46s)

[my own private VPN that I stand up in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m50s)

[Azure So I leave it off most of the time](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m52s)

[But whenever I'm out and especially](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m55s)

[around like a tech conference where I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m56s)

[literally surrounded by a bunch of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h35m58s)

[people who I know many of them probably](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m00s)

[have the skills to do nefarious things](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m02s)

[on the internet Um yeah I I absolutely](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m04s)

[know what let's just not have that as a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m10s)

[risk factor and my VPN would not support](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m13s)

[streaming Like it it it barely handles](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m16s)

[the Netflix like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m20s)

[um because I run cheap tier stuff Uh on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m23s)

[somebody who I actually do know who is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m44s)

[also an MVP very good guy Um but this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m48s)

[the basics for if anybody wanted to spin](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m51s)

[up their own VPN Um and if you if you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m55s)

[create it on the the cheap tier that he](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h36m58s)

[calls out here it's actually very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m00s)

[inexpensive Like you can run a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m03s)

[conference all week long and it's single](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m05s)

[digits in in dollars Um I I set mine up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m07s)

[with like auto shutdown and whatnot and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m12s)

[I think it cost me like a buck 50 like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m13s)

[dirt cheap and and then it's a VPN in a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m17s)

[situation that I control You do want to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m20s)

[be mildly cautious that like if you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m22s)

[stand one of these things up don't just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m25s)

[like stand it up and not install updates](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m26s)

[and things like that because that's a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m29s)

[bad idea too Um but yeah it is not it is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m31s)

[not hard to set up It is not hard to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m34s)

[configure You can get the clients for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m35s)

[your computer and phone and bop booya](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m37s)

[And OpenVPN is free for up to two](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m40s)

[concurrent devices So if you've got a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m42s)

[say a laptop and a phone there's your](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m44s)

[two devices Uh and if you need more uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m46s)

[they have very reasonably priced tiers](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m49s)

[as well So not sponsored by OpenVPN I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m51s)

[just think that they do a good](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m56s)

[job Okay now we've got that We've got](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h37m58s)

[well I would like that to not suck](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m07s)

[Okay now this is where things may go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m12s)

[belly up quick because this is where I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m15s)

[think I want this to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m19s)

[change because I think I want this to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m21s)

[target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m24s)

[folder if I remember](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m25s)

[right So we're going to build this and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m28s)

[then we're going to try it and see what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m30s)

[happens Uh standard directory ID](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m31s)

[attribute target folder is not one of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m34s)

[the Oh target dur](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m36s)

[That's my my big head is probably in the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m39s)

[way but right So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m41s)

[And I think I want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m52s)

[target dur here I think is what I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h38m53s)

[want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m03s)

[Um it might be application folder don't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m04s)

[know And this is this is where this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m08s)

[where things are going to get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m09s)

[interesting because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m10s)

[uh let's see property application folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m13s)

[name could not be found Ensure you have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m15s)

[probably going to start getting confused](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m28s)

[with all of the stuff that I've done Uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m30s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m32s)

[So we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m34s)

[need no co-pilot that is not correct](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m35s)

[work Um](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m48s)

[identifier property win app folder Oh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m50s)

[right This is the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m53s)

[one that changes the default for where](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h39m56s)

[it goes](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m00s)

[That's interesting Copilot I don't know](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m03s)

[why you came up with](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m05s)

[that but I remember seeing this and so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m08s)

[you are now](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m13s)

[just losing your mind So we're going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m14s)

[just comment these out but I may end up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m17s)

[wanting those in a moment](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m19s)

[Um because this guy here corresponds to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m22s)

[we go back to that dialogue We're going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m27s)

[to leave that one open is if I go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m29s)

[advanced or the scope](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m32s)

[dialogue we come in here This is the Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m34s)

[app folder And so it is looking to match](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m39s)

[uh one of these values inside of here I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m44s)

[believe this is what we are looking](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m48s)

[for Scope dialogue per user So this is a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m52s)

[localized](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m57s)

[string but the values that we can](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h40m59s)

[specify are the Wix per user folder or](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m01s)

[Wix per machine folder I think we're](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m03s)

[going to default to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m05s)

[this Go here instead Okay See if that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m07s)

[gets me any](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m11s)

[closer Uh okay And now here we start](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m13s)

[running into all kinds of things that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m16s)

[get weird](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h41m18s)

[is where things start to get confusing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m07s)

[for me a little](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m09s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m11s)

[knows to bring in the the base](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m32s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m38s)

[How's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m46s)

[that collapse this down to there And](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m48s)

[then I will put myself hopefully out of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m54s)

[way And I'll bring this guy](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m55s)

[up So we because we copied in the the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h42m59s)

[advanced uh one and we changed the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m04s)

[IDs though I didn't change all of these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m07s)

[ID And maybe I need](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m12s)

[to maybe I need to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m15s)

[uh cuz a lot of these are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m22s)

[showing duplicate](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m25s)

[duplicate So how does](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m31s)

[it I'm wondering if it's coming](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m37s)

[from this guy](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m40s)

[here but I suspect this is the magical](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m44s)

[property that I am](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m48s)

[uh getting old Oh Izzy I I will say so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h43m52s)

[oh my word](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m18s)

[So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m22s)

[is in one And I I'm gonna I do have this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m28s)

[uh localization WXL file but yes I have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m34s)

[shoved everything into one big one at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m37s)

[the moment](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m39s)

[Um this is just to be clear this is my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m42s)

[test area to to figure out how to make](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m45s)

[once I know what the what the WXS is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m49s)

[supposed to look like then I go move it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m52s)

[actually into the real velop pack stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m55s)

[But this is just my my quick testing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m56s)

[find all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h44m59s)

[installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m01s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m03s)

[00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,560](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m07s)

Um so this one here is

[uh let's see Maybe I should clear clear](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m16s)

[this up and make sure I'm not getting I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m19s)

[think I'm losing track of which one's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m21s)

[where So let me do this Get me a clean](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m23s)

[clean slate of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m26s)

[errors](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m28s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m29s)

[Um so the installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m31s)

[is here and here is the first ones right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m35s)

[right I commented these ones out So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m38s)

[hopefully I can ignore](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m40s)

[those](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m41s)

[Right this one here I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m44s)

[think needs to be changed to match Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m47s)

[UI installed I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m50s)

[think because I think that's how it gets](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m56s)

[output for where it needs to go But the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m57s)

[other thing that's new to me is the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h45m59s)

[standard directory I I am not fully sure](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m01s)

[I gro how this is working](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m04s)

[Uh uh you probably shouldn't probably](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m08s)

[shouldn't use Wix UI](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m13s)

[installed So probably should not or](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m22s)

[should I think the answer is should](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m26s)

[either that or I'm supposed to use](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m29s)

[application folder But I don't think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m30s)

[that is correct](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m33s)

[Well maybe it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m35s)

[is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m37s)

[because I'm also confused as to why it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m39s)

[convinced all of these like I I think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m42s)

[it's telling me to to rename all these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m44s)

[which UI should be setting the normal](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m47s)

[installed directory value](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m49s)

[Okay that's kind of what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m51s)

[I thought and that's how that's how I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m54s)

[have the other one So I have a version](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h46m58s)

[of this that is working now](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m00s)

[Um but it's not using the advanced](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m03s)

[dialogue It's using the location picker](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m06s)

[dialogue And I the the one thing that I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m08s)

[want and let me maybe I'll maybe I'll do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m11s)

[this real quick If I stash this right so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m14s)

[throw away my changes right if I go back](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m17s)

[to where I was right and rebuild](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m19s)

[So so this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m25s)

[is this here is very similar to what I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m28s)

[what I have currently working So this I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m32s)

[I know you probably can't tell the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m35s)

[difference immediately So highlights](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m36s)

[real real quick So this is based upon](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m38s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m41s)

[uh if I go back to the top uh based upon](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m43s)

[the Wix UI installed dialogue set So I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m46s)

[got that working but I also brought I I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m50s)

[also copied in the the full set of the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m54s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m57s)

[um specifically so that I could go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h47m59s)

[through and get rid of uh or or practice](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m01s)

[being able to get rid of like the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m04s)

[license agreement dialogue because in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m05s)

[Velopac if you don't specify a license](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m08s)

[file we don't want a license agreement](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m10s)

[dialogue So this was this was me testing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m12s)

[figuring out how to go through and say](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m15s)

[okay just from the welcome dialogue how](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m16s)

[to skip it And the install dur dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m18s)

[was setting up the the property for me I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m22s)

[thought right it was setting up the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m27s)

[installer](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m29s)

[um that that this guy would then use](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m31s)

[And that seemed to workish but didn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m37s)

[but yeah there was there was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m41s)

[questions because this seems to always](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m44s)

[go to you know program files because I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m47s)

[said go to program files and so that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m48s)

[that felt a little off and I and and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m51s)

[maybe this is my this is the problem](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m54s)

[with some of these magical values is you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m56s)

[set the right ID and things happen and I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h48m59s)

[I was trying to understand where they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m02s)

[were going](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m04s)

[Um be because my goal is to not have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m06s)

[this uh install dur dialogue My goal is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m10s)

[to have the uh what did what did they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m14s)

[call the other one uh the install scope](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m17s)

[dialogue instead which is just the two](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m20s)

[radio buttons That way it will either](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m22s)

[install program files or install local](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m25s)

[app directory because I wanted to mirror](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m27s)

[what the the setup exe does](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m29s)

[Um and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m32s)

[so my goal was to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m34s)

[leverage what I thought I wanted to do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m37s)

[was take with what I have here and go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m40s)

["Oh okay I'll just bring that other](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m42s)

[dialogue into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m43s)

[it That didn't work I ran into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m45s)

[problems." And I can show you how cuz I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m48s)

[have that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m51s)

[here This was my attempt at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m52s)

[that Right So once again similar thing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m55s)

[um where I was like okay let's get rid](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h49m59s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m02s)

[install dialogue and go with the install](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m03s)

[scope dialogue and try to get that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m05s)

[working And this this compiles and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m07s)

[builds an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m11s)

[MSI But regardless of which radio button](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m12s)

[I pick it always just installs the C](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m15s)

[colon which shockingly is not quite what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m17s)

[I wanted And I I was like "This feels](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m20s)

[close because I I just brought in the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m23s)

[one dialogue I wanted but I I was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m25s)

[struggling to figure out how to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m29s)

[get how to get the out." So and this and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m32s)

[maybe maybe you can answer this question](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m35s)

[for me So I have mucked with this a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m36s)

[little bit right so just to be clear](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m39s)

[this is not what it is out on here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m40s)

[because this is this is where I had](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m44s)

[started](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m46s)

[from and I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m47s)

[can drop a link Right So this is where I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m49s)

[started from And you'll note this is the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m52s)

[5.0.2 branch because that was the latest](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m54s)

[full release tag that I that they had](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h50m58s)

[out there And that's the version of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m00s)

[Wix.exe I've pulled in So along with](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m02s)

[relevant uh Wix UI extension package](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m06s)

[nougat package version So this is where](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m09s)

[I had started from where they had this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m11s)

[application folder And I'm like well](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m13s)

[that that's fine but that didn't that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m14s)

[didn't make sense to me on how to get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m17s)

[that application folder out And so I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m20s)

[started playing around with things to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m23s)

[try to figure out how to change](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m24s)

[it And frankly I couldn't figure out how](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m26s)

[to change it But now that I say that I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m28s)

[am wondering if that if what I may have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m31s)

[just become a really good](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m34s)

[duck Let me Now that I say that I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m36s)

[wondering if this is actually supposed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m39s)

[to be application folder And down](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m40s)

[here this is supposed to be UI installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m44s)

[It's value application](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m48s)

[folder Wondering if that is the magical](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m52s)

[incantation that I was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h51m55s)

[missing And this is supposed to be ster](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m01s)

[I I I don't know But we're going to try](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m04s)

[this now that I say that out loud](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m08s)

[duplicate](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m12s)

[property and the Okay so I'm back into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m16s)

[the same problem that I that I have on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m19s)

[the other one is I don't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m21s)

[understand is is it because of this that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m25s)

[it thinks there's a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m28s)

[dupe](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m31s)

[no](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m33s)

[Okay this is this is where](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m36s)

[I'm mildly](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m39s)

[confused and I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m41s)

[if Wix UI installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m44s)

[or](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m48s)

[of maybe I should go maybe I should go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m49s)

[back to checking this So where where](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m52s)

[else are you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h52m54s)

[This is using set target path Oh is this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m06s)

[what I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m10s)

[missing oh I wonder if that's my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m15s)

[problem Make it VP installed there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m18s)

[Okay But this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m25s)

[Oh I might be getting Okay You're saying](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m28s)

[if I do something like this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m33s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m35s)

[then because I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m39s)

[realizing the previous Oh I may have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m41s)

[missed this before The previous code](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m44s)

[that they have out here they have their](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m46s)

[install scope stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m49s)

[Right And then they when they go next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m51s)

[they either go to the features dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m54s)

[or the install](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m56s)

[dialogue or the installer dialogue But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h53m57s)

[if they go to the features dialogue they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m00s)

[eventually go to the installer dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m03s)

[anyway And this is the one that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m06s)

[actually calling set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m08s)

[path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m11s)

[Oh I because I don't actually want to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m14s)

[let install dur dialogue pop I just I am](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m17s)

[not calling set target path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m22s)

[anywhere And I probably need to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m24s)

[calling set target path in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m26s)

[here Oh is that the magical incantation](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m31s)

[that I've been](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m34s)

[missing here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m38s)

[Here The target path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m41s)

[I I have a strong suspicion Set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m50s)

[path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=00h54m53s)

[application folder is a property and it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h01m23s)

[then it's value is used to set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h01m27s)

[path and then the last event is to go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h01m30s)

[through and set the new dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h01m33s)

[just confirm that we still get the 20](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m35s)

[872 So if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m42s)

[we This is where I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m44s)

[there's something expected in one of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m47s)

[these dialogues that I'm not aware of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m49s)

[that is biting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m52s)

[me because what I'm what I'm missing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m57s)

[here is it in this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h02m59s)

[flow if we if we specify the per user](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m03s)

[folder it goes straight to the features](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m06s)

[dialogue Right that's the next dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m08s)

[This guy gets](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m10s)

[shown](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m12s)

[Um and then based upon some conditions](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m14s)

[where our our back directory is going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m18s)

[go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m21s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m23s)

[actions are what need to end up getting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m54s)

[set right because this is where I assume](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m55s)

[when it's using the Wix per user folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h03m59s)

[is making me question how low to the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h07m41s)

[ground it is flying](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h07m44s)

[Okay so this was installed control next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h07m47s)

[do action validate path So when you hit](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h07m50s)

[do let's let's do um some spelunking](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h29m46s)

[here So since check path doesn't give me](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h29m50s)

[MSI stuff in and done So I'm probably](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h31m28s)

[gonna spending a bunch of time coding on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h31m30s)

[this So expect to see changes If](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h31m32s)

[anybody's wanting to follow progress the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h31m36s)

[uh the MSI branch out on the Velopac](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h31m38s)

[I am seeing for this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m10s)

[someone has](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m18s)

[to cool Izzy I really appreciate it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m29s)

[Thank you Like this is I I feel like I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m31s)

[am slowly dissecting the the inner](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m35s)

[workings of Wix and it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m38s)

[uh non-trivial](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m41s)

[That's That takes me back to that same](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m46s)

[place where why do I feel like there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m48s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m51s)

[a one here on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h32m58s)

[543 Validate path I wonder if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m06s)

[this because there's the binary ref I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m10s)

[bet you this is the actual](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m13s)

[the now we find the usefulness common](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m22s)

[platform](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m26s)

[Aha This is where it comes](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m30s)

[from There's the DL entry point There's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m34s)

[the location Okay So it's going to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m37s)

[something akin to that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m40s)

[Ah this this makes slightly more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m43s)

[sense Then this is probably the method](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m48s)

[here Got it So it is expecting the Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h33m57s)

[UI](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m01s)

[installed as the property that it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m02s)

[looking for See not that hard Let me now](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m05s)

[let me confirm Is that true in this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m07s)

[version](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m10s)

[yes Wix UI installer is the property](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m12s)

[that it expects to find Okay see all we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m15s)

[had to do was go finding the source code](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m19s)

[of the method understand how to invoke](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m21s)

[it properly So by the time we get here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m24s)

[we need Wix UI installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m28s)

[set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m32s)

[Um now I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m41s)

[think I think what I actually want to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m45s)

[set is this property](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m48s)

[here I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m51s)

[think Let's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h34m56s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m00s)

[see](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m03s)

[Then we'll clear this out Save](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m05s)

[Launch We're going to go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m11s)

[next Current](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m13s)

[user Get the same error](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m16s)

[but let's see](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m20s)

[Uh property change deleting Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m28s)

[Wait current value is installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m37s)

[there Wait a minute Deleting the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m41s)

[property does not sound like what I want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m45s)

[Uh property change modifying whip wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m49s)

[app folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h35m54s)

[Why yeah So the install](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m17s)

[scope being invalid I think is an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m20s)

[artifact of this thing being here Why](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m22s)

[would it property change deleting wix UI](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m25s)

[installed there what did I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m29s)

[do because this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m42s)

[thing assembly blah blah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h36m53s)

[blah install folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m00s)

[I guess the question then is what did I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m15s)

[change from](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m20s)

[here where I had](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m22s)

[the alder dialogue because this guy](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m25s)

[here I'll make that larger](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m29s)

[was calling set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m40s)

[path which UI installed there order](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m44s)

[one that was definitely happening](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m47s)

[early and then](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m51s)

[validate path was happening order](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h37m57s)

[two](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m03s)

[So that makes it seem very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m08s)

[simplistic If this was the sum total of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m15s)

[what was happening](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m18s)

[before and this that would strongly hint](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m20s)

[to me that what I need to do is this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m24s)

[This is this is all it was doing before](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m29s)

[and it was doing it early in the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m31s)

[process But I would](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m34s)

[like effectively this line here right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m37s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m40s)

[identical](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m43s)

[Yep Set target path value](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m45s)

[I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h38m57s)

[uh the set target path Wix UI installed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m00s)

[But what set the Wix UI](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m05s)

[installed making an assumption that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m10s)

[that's where it needs to set But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m12s)

[maybe maybe it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m16s)

[needs like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m19s)

[So let's hold on Let's try Let's try](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m27s)

[something a rather than](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m29s)

[this Let's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m33s)

[go Grab these lines](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m38s)

[here Maybe I Maybe I'm not reading this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m42s)

[quite](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m44s)

[right I was reading these as setting the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m49s)

[property previous thing wasn't setting a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m51s)

[property It was just setting the target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m54s)

[path where would get where would set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h39m59s)

[target path get its](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m02s)

[value](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m05s)

[like let's let's find](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m09s)

[that I will I will I will learn the wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m12s)

[uh that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m17s)

[is not useful So let's go here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m18s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m28s)

[back I don't want to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m30s)

[tab I can hold on to it So set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m33s)

[path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m36s)

[um might be there but I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m41s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m44s)

[mapping because there will be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m45s)

[a a mapping just like we found on the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m49s)

[other one that maps one thing into the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m52s)

[other here Modulize](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h40m57s)

[command that target path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m03s)

[I set target path I think it's going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m08s)

[be this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m11s)

[guy Let's see Uh required field](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m17s)

[path not in here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m34s)

[anywhere Oh this might be out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m38s)

[native Oh uh this is a wind32 API that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m48s)

[it is calling out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m55s)

[to See if this link is even valid](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h41m57s)

[still](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m00s)

[Oop Uh let's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m02s)

[see That's the full path to the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m07s)

[designated folder on the installation](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m09s)

[target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m11s)

[drive](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m13s)

[Uh in memory directory](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m15s)

[table changes the path specification for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m20s)

[the directory in the memory directory](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m23s)

[table the properties](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m24s)

[affected Got it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m31s)

[So that is a native](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m35s)

[call But more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m40s)

[importantly is it is expecting to read](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m42s)

[from those properties There is still a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m45s)

[question I have in my mind of where the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m48s)

[dialogue set that uh let's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m55s)

[see](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h42m59s)

[dialogue So it sets that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m10s)

[property Okay So the dialogue sets that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m14s)

[property then this thing called set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m20s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m23s)

[So because I don't have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m27s)

[that I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m31s)

[need this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m34s)

[guy set this property based upon](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m37s)

[the and then I need to all set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m43s)

[path with the property in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m47s)

[question](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h43m56s)

[Um I think that's where that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m07s)

[goes I installed there That sets there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m15s)

[That gets me to six Then check path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m20s)

[seven I think we're going to just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m29s)

[do Yeah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m40s)

[that What happens after](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m46s)

[that okay try this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m52s)

[again Okay got it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h44m56s)

[locked That gets me to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h45m01s)

[there Then once again we're just whack](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h45m04s)

[really you think that's the problem Okay](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h49m40s)

[works okay](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h50m32s)

[So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h50m34s)

[close We're going to give it the benefit](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h50m37s)

[problem Okay let's let's give this a try](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h51m49s)

[I am thinking](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h51m53s)

[now that the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h51m55s)

[issue So install level So we're down at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m03s)

[least as far as](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m06s)

[233 Uh let's see Next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m07s)

[Next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m11s)

[Failure Okay](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m14s)

[But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m37s)

[I where was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m41s)

[this which I installed or](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m43s)

[reference this exists in advance but I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m46s)

[not referencing advance So how would it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m50s)

[know how would it know which one I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m53s)

[intend to use](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h52m56s)

[what did I reference at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m05s)

[the II common UI ref I have in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m10s)

[there which makes me](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m23s)

[Wonder those ones go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m33s)

[there Uh so this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m36s)

[guy get property blah blah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m41s)

[blah does the stuff](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m45s)

[uh for Wix UI dialog set that require it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m52s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h53m56s)

[blah because it's means](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m04s)

[set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m12s)

[by dial those two dialogues either](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m19s)

[browse or](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m23s)

[installer Yeah there's something I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m37s)

[I'm missing something very simple](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m40s)

[Publish event set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m48s)

[path I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m55s)

[installed no license So this is the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h54m57s)

[sample test](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m01s)

[for effectively documentation that shows](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m03s)

[you how to drop out the license](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m06s)

[dialogue But I am](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m13s)

[wondering this is expecting to set a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m16s)

[value or a property that's already](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m25s)

[there because I believe the square](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m31s)

[braces says read the property value and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m34s)

[put it in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m37s)

[there I think what that does](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m40s)

[Do we actually](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m52s)

[So if that's the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m54s)

[case doesn't don't we already](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h55m57s)

[have Don't we already have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m03s)

[properties i'm kind of wondering can I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m06s)

[just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m09s)

[use this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m11s)

[set the target path But that's going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m23s)

[set the target path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m26s)

[But that won't fix the check](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m30s)

[path because the check path from above](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m34s)

[expects the other property to set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m38s)

[already because this guy](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m43s)

[here validate](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m45s)

[path expects that to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m48s)

[set But if I do this and just turn off](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m55s)

[check this should set my target path to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h56m58s)

[the per user path and then the thing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m02s)

[should](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m05s)

[work I think the check is going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m06s)

[fail But in theory it should stall](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m10s)

[install to a per user](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m13s)

[location See if that actually plays out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m18s)

[the way](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m21s)

[Let's check assumption So it doesn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m23s)

[matter what radio button you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m24s)

[pick Oh interesting 2872](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m26s)

[again We got a 2872 even](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m30s)

[without Oh interesting So we got that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m34s)

[air We got that air even](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m49s)

[without So it must be this that's do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m54s)

[that's doing that set target path So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h57m58s)

[let's check that I think that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m00s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m07s)

[that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m13s)

[next Oh next doesn't go anywhere now](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m18s)

[Um this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m34s)

[should user folder So I guess the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m48s)

[question](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m50s)

[is make this order like I don't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m53s)

[know far enough back that it doesn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m56s)

[matter So that should at least allow us](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h58m59s)

[to get to the next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m00s)

[dialogue But I'm curious what properties](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m03s)

[get set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m07s)

[to Right So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m08s)

[here next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m11s)

[So it set up and installed but it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m14s)

[probably just gonna go to the wrong](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m17s)

[place](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m20s)

[It's just installed to C colon which I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m36s)

[think if I look down here what I expect](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m39s)

[is that my my target directory didn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m43s)

[get changed which is why it's still](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m46s)

[there Yeah So target directory didn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m50s)

[get updated because I didn't call set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m52s)

[target directory So not a shock So it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m53s)

[didn't change So I installed there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m56s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=01h59m57s)

[But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m00s)

[the I'm going to add a per machine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m07s)

[folder Um application folder name](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m12s)

[applicaler](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m18s)

[installer Uh so what I am looking for is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m27s)

[the property I think exists](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m36s)

[for and maybe that's the problem Baby I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m39s)

[am I am making the ass Oh I bet](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m46s)

[you I wonder if that's the issue I am](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m51s)

[making the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m55s)

[assumption that these properties](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h00m56s)

[exist and they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m00s)

[don't Okay so set Okay so these things](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m08s)

[all of these custom actions I'm assuming](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m12s)

[get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m14s)

[fired but these are not going to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m20s)

[fired right like this guy here what](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m26s)

[invokes this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m29s)

[action is if I look in my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m31s)

[installer right and I go custom](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m35s)

[action right there are these custom](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m38s)

[actions don't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m41s)

[exist So I don't have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m43s)

[these So the fact that I don't have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m49s)

[these is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m53s)

[problematic I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h01m56s)

[the Does the order of properties matter](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m04s)

[um it kind of does JC So take what I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m07s)

[going to say with a grain of salt](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m10s)

[because I am not an expert here but the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m12s)

[order attribute on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m15s)

[them like so when you declare things in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m18s)

[XML for Wix because an MSI is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m22s)

[effectively just like you can think of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m26s)

[it like an Excel spreadsheet or an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m28s)

[Access database It's just tables with](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m29s)

[values](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m32s)

[And](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m34s)

[so the order in the XML doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m35s)

[as much but like this order here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m38s)

[definitely dictates](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m40s)

[ordering because when the MSI is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m42s)

[executed the order in which things are](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m45s)

[pulled out is is driven by this So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m46s)

[ordering the XML not as important as the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m49s)

[order](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m53s)

[attribute Again take it with a grain of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m56s)

[salt That is based upon](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h02m58s)

[my cursory](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h03m01s)

[understanding I think I need all](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h03m04s)

[this and this would go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h03m10s)

[here Resetting installed after Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h03m17s)

[Wix Maybe I'm missing where you saw](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h03m37s)

[that I think Oh not in this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h03m50s)

[I these custom actions getting triggered](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m04s)

[I think is what I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m07s)

[am what I am functionally](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m09s)

[actions](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m19s)

[Um and it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m22s)

[Oh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m27s)

[Oh So the before and after kind of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m30s)

[function similar to how they do MS](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m33s)

[build So there may not be a direct](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m36s)

[reference This just gets injected into](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m39s)

[the Oh this gets injected as part](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m41s)

[of the steps](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m45s)

[So this would](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m49s)

[require application folder to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m50s)

[set which is what this would be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m54s)

[doing So I should so as long Oh okay](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h04m58s)

[Okay Okay So as long as I've got](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m02s)

[that and I've got application folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m05s)

[being](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m08s)

[set We'll deal with the rest of this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m13s)

[here in a moment but I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m15s)

[think this builds That probably gets me](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m19s)

[pretty close Okay Okay I should probably](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m22s)

[hit save before I build anything because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m24s)

[that's kind of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m27s)

[important Yeah Not saving is very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m29s)

[important](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m33s)

[Duplicate Duplicate Okay So I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m36s)

[think let's just change the IDs on these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m39s)

[because I know they aren't getting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m43s)

[added pack Going to prefix all of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m47s)

[them Technically one of the steps is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m53s)

[to do it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h05m57s)

[Um and I want pack on my clipboard](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m03s)

[please And there there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m06s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m13s)

[there already has](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m16s)

[it Checking the values on each of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m20s)

[these Okay Because I think the key](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m26s)

[injection is this before cost finalize](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m28s)

[because that is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m32s)

[what is what there is a There's a page](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m33s)

[that outlines the stages of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m37s)

[uh close my](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m42s)

[um there](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m47s)

[is the execution](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m49s)

[sequence that what it's called](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m53s)

[uh sequence this thing here and if you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h06m57s)

[sort by the the ID number here this is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m00s)

[where things get uh put in injected So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m04s)

[when you see before cost finalize means](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m09s)

[it's going to come in at a number before](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m11s)

[1,00 And as far as I can tell what this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m13s)

[means is take this before number and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m16s)

[subtract until you are in front of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m18s)

[it At least as far as I can tell that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m22s)

[that seems to be the the way the values](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m25s)

[come out of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m27s)

[it Okay So now I I'm kind of curious to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m29s)

[look](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m33s)

[at this thing here Do I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m35s)

[see aha Now I see the sequence guys](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m39s)

[being](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m43s)

[added](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m44s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m48s)

[Okay Now let's give this a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m50s)

[try Let's give this a try Is that the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m53s)

[secret sauce I've](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m56s)

[been next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h07m58s)

[next](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m07s)

[Okay Well it installed to the wrong](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m12s)

[place So that's not a good thing But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m15s)

[that is probably due to the not calling](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m17s)

[set target path](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m20s)

[If we come down here though](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m23s)

[um what we should](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m27s)

[find is something related to the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m31s)

[um per user property Property change](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m36s)

[adding per user folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m40s)

[property Boom](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m42s)

[Boom That looks like a per user property](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m44s)

[Per machine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m47s)

[property Uh that looks straight up wrong](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m49s)

[So that's exciting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m52s)

[Um change application folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m55s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h08m59s)

[here That's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m02s)

[that's and then doing action cost](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m06s)

[finalized blah blah blah blah blah It](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m09s)

[does does the needful and then target D](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m11s)

[is still here Okay So we've got a couple](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m15s)

[Okay Okay Now we're cooking with fire](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m17s)

[Okay this makes me feel better So this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m20s)

[guy here is relying on application](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m24s)

[folder name to be specified Property ref](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m26s)

[application folder name That doesn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m29s)

[exist Come up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m30s)

[here This is just being set to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m32s)

[application folder name That's not real](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m35s)

[helpful So let's make it something a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m37s)

[little more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m39s)

[meaningful Boom Okay So that will that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m42s)

[will make the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m46s)

[name be more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m47s)

[meaningful Now per](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m49s)

[machine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m56s)

[prized the Wix per machine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h09m58s)

[folder so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m03s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m05s)

[Um oh this is local programs So that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m07s)

[just probably not the one that I want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m11s)

[And instead I would like the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m14s)

[value that was](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m18s)

[here I want this directory](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m23s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m28s)

[So I want that And I'll leave myself a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m30s)

[note](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m36s)

[to both](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m40s)

[on there's there's special ones and when](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m43s)

[we copy it over to the Velopac repo](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m46s)

[we've got a a 64-bit flag that I can](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m48s)

[turn on but for now hard code is fine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m51s)

[Note for later](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m54s)

[though Okay And then these are just the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m55s)

[conditions under which they're going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h10m58s)

[be applied Those are fine Okay So this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m00s)

[before cost finalize is the kicker to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m03s)

[able to get us in these things Do the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m06s)

[needful That should fix that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m08s)

[directory Everyone's happy This is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m12s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m15s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m19s)

[to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m21s)

[check path because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m23s)

[that slash apps is not correct Most of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m25s)

[these variables that I've seen in Wix](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m29s)

[end in a a trailing slash which is why](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m31s)

[you don't see anything here Oh for](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m33s)

[better or worse That is how they tend to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m36s)

[exist Okay so that gets us to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m41s)

[there Now we come back to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m44s)

[here Now I think we can actually start](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m48s)

[bringing this stuff back in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h11m52s)

[Um the interesting part is I can't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m02s)

[do I can't invoke](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m07s)

[this yet](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m11s)

[And the reason I say I can't invoke it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m17s)

[is because this whole setup bit that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m19s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m22s)

[happen is going to occur](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m26s)

[here Well but hold on Is that a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m31s)

[problem set default Let me get Let's go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m35s)

[back to here because it set up all of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m38s)

[these things Adding application](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m40s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m42s)

[Uh but it's a different thing like react](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m45s)

[Yeah So so this is specifically](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m48s)

[um so this is Wix installer and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h12m56s)

[uh specifically what I am looking to do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m01s)

[here I'll just clarify for actually we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m04s)

[can this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m07s)

[um fellow pack](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m10s)

[is uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m15s)

[uh I am one of the founders of said](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m19s)

[company Um and the idea here is a very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m21s)

[fast and easy installation specifically](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m24s)

[cross language crossplatform um which is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m27s)

[not usually seen in most](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m29s)

[places But the idea is that you can go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m32s)

[through and build an installer quick and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m35s)

[easy like but for Windows people like](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m37s)

[MSIs](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m41s)

[Um yeah we're getting a UI out of this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m43s)

[but most of the but the UI is kind of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m46s)

[accidental Most of why we're doing this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m50s)

[is because CIS admins and similar really](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m52s)

[really like MSIs They feel more secure](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h13m57s)

[It's not just an arbitrary .exe that's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m00s)

[going to be able to to run things It's a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m02s)

[a database that they can look and they](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m05s)

[can see the components and they know](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m06s)

[exactly what's going to be applied and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m08s)

[what's not and that kind of thing So I'm](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m09s)

[playing on a branch right now but the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m13s)

[idea being that after you run VPK pack](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m14s)

[you tack on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m17s)

[a-s in addition to the regular installer](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m18s)

[stuff that it'll generate it'll also](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m21s)

[generate one of these MSIs for you So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m22s)

[obviously MSI is Windows specific It](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m25s)

[doesn't work crossplatform This is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m27s)

[mostly around people building Windows](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m29s)

[apps really want that kind of feature So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m32s)

[um if you're building a cross-platform](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m36s)

[thing it's it's probably not that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m38s)

[relevant to you Um but the setup exe at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m40s)

[least at present doesn't expose you a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m43s)

[way to install all user Um it installs](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m46s)

[current user only Um after after this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m48s)

[branch merges you technically could](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m54s)

[abuse the setup exe because there's a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m56s)

[command line flag you could pass to say](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h14m58s)

[install into a different location It's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m00s)

[kind of cheating Um but it it would end](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m02s)

[up functionally working that way It's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m05s)

[not really a supported scenario but](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m07s)

[after my branch merges then the setup](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m09s)

[exe is hip to handling permissions uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m12s)

[and elevation and that kind of thing So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m14s)

[it it gets kind of complicated when you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m16s)

[want an app to self-update and it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m19s)

[installed inside of a protected](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m21s)

[directory like E program files because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m22s)

[you need to be able to download the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m26s)

[updated package You need to then elevate](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m28s)

[yourself to be able to apply the package](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m31s)

[because you need to write to the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m33s)

[protected directory Um and then you want](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m34s)

[to restart the app but not in an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m37s)

[elevated context So it's kind of a a fun](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m39s)

[bait and switch maneuver to try to do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m43s)

[all of those things and have it work](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m45s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m47s)

[So really the fact that this MSI has a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m48s)

[UI is kind of somewhat accidental Um a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m51s)

[big portion of it though is people](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m55s)

[wanting on Windows to be able to have an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m57s)

[all users install rather than a just a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h15m59s)

[current user install which is what you](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m01s)

[get with the XC So this is this is kind](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m03s)

[of killing two birds with one stone So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m04s)

[making CIS admin people happier um and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m06s)

[giving an option for people who want an](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m10s)

[all users install solution as well We](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m11s)

[may put a UI inside of the exi at some](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m14s)

[point Um but once we do that like we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m17s)

[we're going to do the UI in a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m21s)

[crossplatform way Uh because that that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m23s)

[setup installer is expected be usable on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m26s)

[Linux Mac and Windows And so um we may](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m30s)

[end up using Tori or something of that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m34s)

[nature Um but we're also trying to be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m36s)

[cautious of not growing the size of the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m38s)

[installer too much because if you build](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m40s)

[a tiny little app that's you know 3meg](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m43s)

[you don't want to slap on a 20meg](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m46s)

[installer on top of it like that's kind](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m48s)

[of so because part of Velipac's promise](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m51s)

[is to be small fast](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m54s)

[um and so we don't want to do something](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h16m57s)

[that's going to make it less small and](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m00s)

[less fast without good](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m02s)

[reason But yeah so that that's that So I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m05s)

[am kind of down in the weeds of how the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m09s)

[MSI is going to be built inside of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m11s)

[Vellopac Uh but if all you're looking to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m13s)

[do is um create an installer and ship](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m16s)

[your app check out Velopac If you have](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m19s)

[problems uh we love to handle stuff on](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m22s)

[the Discord so feel free to reach](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m26s)

[out](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m31s)

[Okay so this goes here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m33s)

[Um I wish I knew at which](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m42s)

[point this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m45s)

[ran because I kind of want to set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m49s)

[dur the the hard part is if the target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m53s)

[directory is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h17m56s)

[invalid I guess we don't care do we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m00s)

[we don't really care that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m05s)

[much because we're not allowing a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m08s)

[picker We could just send it right](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m17s)

[um I think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m31s)

[so I think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m35s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m37s)

[Um because this executes immediately](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m40s)

[Let's let me pop this open because I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m44s)

[kind of want to look at the order of](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m46s)

[operations](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m47s)

[here Uh let's see So order by sequence](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m49s)

[number](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m53s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h18m55s)

[So oh so these things are actually set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m02s)

[before we actually get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m05s)

[to Well where's the connection](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m07s)

[between this and the UI sequence](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m11s)

[i look at this thing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m16s)

[here Cost](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m23s)

[initialize cost](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m25s)

[finalize So these guys all get set So](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m33s)

[these are all run prior to even hitting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m39s)

[the welcome dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m41s)

[Oh wait a minute Wait a minute Wait a](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m49s)

[minute Where is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m51s)

[the I should have an install scope](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m55s)

[dialogue in this list shouldn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h19m58s)

[I i'm missing it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m00s)

[Oh no The welcome dialogue is the entry](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m10s)

[point Does the welcome dialogue change](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m13s)

[the other ones](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m16s)

[together](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m18s)

[there's there's the individual](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m32s)

[components Full event](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m35s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m40s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m41s)

[Event Where's the set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m43s)

[dialogue that target path Right now it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m46s)

[just that one Okay That one doesn't go](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m48s)

[Okay So these things should Okay so this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m52s)

[should already be set by the time we get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m55s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h20m57s)

[So I should be able to do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m11s)

[this with set target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m12s)

[path and I should be able to set](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m16s)

[it at this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m19s)

[point the application folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m22s)

[because that should already be](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m29s)

[applied Okay let's try this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m32s)

[again And then we're going to remember](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m37s)

[that Orca locks the file because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m40s)

[reasons That's building We're going to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m46s)

[go clear that guy out We're going to run](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m48s)

[with](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m51s)

[logging where we can get useful output](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m52s)

[We're going to stall](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m57s)

[all Oh shoot 2872 Dang](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h21m58s)

[it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m02s)

[02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:14,240](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m05s)

So application folder Its value

[is current value app data local](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m15s)

[and it was switched over to app data](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m20s)

[programs](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m22s)

[seems weird since I thought I had](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m24s)

[changed that to not behave that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m26s)

[way](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m29s)

[Um her machine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m31s)

[folder Didn't I change](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m44s)

[that something is still setting it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m53s)

[incorrectly](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m56s)

[But](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h22m58s)

[regardless yeah something is setting](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m03s)

[that incorrectly](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m05s)

[Um but we will run that down in a moment](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m08s)

[That doesn't quite concern me as much](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m12s)

[Well it does concern me because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m15s)

[without without that assignment properly](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m20s)

[um it does have my Wix per machine](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m27s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m31s)

[there Wix per machine folder program](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m38s)

[files x64 folder which should be a very](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m41s)

[different](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m50s)

[thing Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h23m53s)

[folder condition](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m07s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m13s)

[why that target](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m17s)

[path Oh uh so this is not actually](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m20s)

[reporting them in order So one 2 3 four](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m24s)

[five](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m28s)

[six and then new dialogue But we failed](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m33s)

[out here](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m36s)

[Right And then](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m44s)

[see let's set all of those up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m46s)

[Change the all users](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h24m50s)

[folder It's interesting these errors](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m15s)

[occur first and then we get this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m17s)

[one](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m20s)

[Uh so it's set the application](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m22s)

[folder right and that looks correctish](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m31s)

[aside from the fact that it's wrong](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m35s)

[Let's blow this away and try it one more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m37s)

[time This time with the current](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m39s)

[user Uh let's close Orca](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m42s)

[And then try it one more](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m46s)

[time Go Next Current](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h25m53s)

[make sense to me that I need to do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h27m14s)

[this I I think the AI is an idiot is](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h27m21s)

[what I think](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h27m25s)

[But I have also learned that I should at](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h27m27s)

[horrible](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h33m19s)

[Um okay Uh](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h33m30s)

[close Uh let's see here Try this again](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h33m37s)

[Does this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h33m42s)

[value stored in that property](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h33m59s)

[so it claims the code passes the value](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h34m08s)

[That's interesting because](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h34m41s)

[that that kind of tracks but it also](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h34m43s)

[uh it also doesn't](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h34m53s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h34m55s)

[Um I wonder if I move](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m11s)

[it further down](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m15s)

[What if rather than doing it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m24s)

[here we do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m26s)

[it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m30s)

[here I'm just I'm confused because this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m38s)

[doesn't have a next registered to it And](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m41s)

[so I'm kind of curious as to how that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m43s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m45s)

[works So if we back this guy](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m47s)

[up really now it's just coming down to](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m51s)

[this idea of how can I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m53s)

[specify the value](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h35m56s)

[uh sorry what was the name of that thing](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m00s)

[verify ready](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m01s)

[dialogue verify ready dialogue](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m04s)

[uh let's see type push button blah blah](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m11s)

[blah so it has](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m15s)

[Various install](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m21s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m31s)

[and push event end](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m35s)

[dialogue spawn dialogue end](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m39s)

[dialogue So it handles all of these](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m42s)

[built in depending on where it's](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m45s)

[at because it knows if](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m50s)

[it's all users or not And this is why I](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h36m55s)

[want to make sure those get](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m00s)

[set Can we](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m07s)

[But how does it](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m18s)

[know this is going to pass in](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m27s)

[application folder name This runs early](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m29s)

[This sets](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m33s)

[up for user folder Execute immediately](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m36s)

[This already has all of this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m40s)

[set So I'm back down to the idea of why](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m45s)

[can I not just](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m49s)

[blindly do](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m52s)

[this If I bring this guy up](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h37m59s)

[here I don't think you're doing a darn](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h38m02s)

[thing But why can I not just do this](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h38m04s)

[and wire this guy in here because that](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h38m11s)

[property should be long since set by the](https://youtu.be/1OZsQ6dPoss?t=02h38m14s)
