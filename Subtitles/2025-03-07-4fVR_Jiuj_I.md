[hello everyone welcome back uh tonight](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m02s)

[we are going to be doing testing testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m04s)

[and more testing because that is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m06s)

[theme for today uh specifically there's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m09s)

[some cool announcements or I guess more](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m12s)

[accurately I just found out about cool](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m15s)

[stuff so like all this stuff happened a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m17s)

[while ago i'm just now finding out about](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m20s)

[it and so now I'm excited so back on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m22s)

[February 10th right you'll note I'm uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m25s)

[I'm a little behind for those people](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m27s)

[watching the future it's March 6 so you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m29s)

[know I didn't wait quite a month the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m31s)

[Microsoft testing platform uh is now out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m33s)

[for all major .NET frameworks and this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m36s)

[is kind of cool so this is Microsoft](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m40s)

[kind of reimagining](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m42s)

[uh what modern testing would look like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m44s)

[because back with like MS test and yield](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m48s)

[stuff um those were built at a time](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m51s)

[before we had some of the the newer](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m54s)

[C.NET features that would be kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m56s)

[cool so things like well let's see um no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h00m58s)

[resources comparison with VS test right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m03s)

[so like one of the issues with most of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m06s)

[the old testr runner structure is it was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m08s)

[reflectionheavy uh it had to go through](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m12s)

[examine all of your classes discover the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m14s)

[tests figure out execute them and do all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m16s)

[of that which is not horrible and at the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m19s)

[time it was built it was uh arguably](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m21s)

[probably the best way to do it but we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m24s)

[now have things like source generators](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m27s)

[that mitigate the need for a lot of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m29s)

[reflection because we can now do things](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m30s)

[at compile time because it's not like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m32s)

[we're dynamically loading a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m35s)

[we know the number of unit tests we're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m37s)

[going to have at compile time it's not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m39s)

[like I'm I'm looking to build an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m41s)

[extension framework where I'm going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m43s)

[drop in DLS and dynamically load my test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m44s)

[that sounds](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m46s)

[horrible so instead of that it was like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m48s)

[okay what what would also be better well](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m50s)

[what about a lot more crossplatform](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m52s)

[stuff what about making it easier to run](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m54s)

[and that's kind of what this testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m56s)

[platform do is a lot faster um unlike](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h01m57s)

[being fancy and kind of tied in heavily](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m03s)

[to kind of this weird architecture I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m05s)

[think I think I remember actually seeing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m08s)

[a I think I remember seeing a page on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m13s)

[here around the architecture overview of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m16s)

[of how this was set up and maybe it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m19s)

[here there was a nice picture I thought](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m23s)

[that I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m24s)

[saw i've been reading a lot of stuff i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m26s)

[might just be imagining it um oh testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m28s)

[platform architecture yeah this looks](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m33s)

[sounds more like it where's the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m36s)

[picture yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m38s)

[yeah extensions capabilities](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m40s)

[i have sworn I saw a nice picture of the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m44s)

[the basically the number of steps that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m46s)

[the old the old structure for running](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m47s)

[tests has to kind of jump through](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m50s)

[because you've got the the test host](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m51s)

[that has to fire up and the integration](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m53s)

[going back and forth uh from your setup](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m55s)

[and all of this stuff and that's kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h02m58s)

[a lot of work in order to be able to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m02s)

[just run some methods because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m04s)

[functionally that's what a test is it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m06s)

[just a method that is going to run some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m08s)

[code and then make some assertions on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m10s)

[the output and by make some assertions I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m12s)

[mean throw exceptions if those uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m15s)

[expectations aren't met so we have this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m18s)

[new Microsoft testing platform and I got](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m22s)

[really really excited so for anybody who](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m24s)

[wants to follow along at home net blog](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m26s)

[has a nice little link](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m29s)

[there um and they've been calling it MTP](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m30s)

[for Microsoft testing platform because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m34s)

[this is a mouthful and MTP is uh only](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m37s)

[two syllables to work](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m41s)

[with no three i can't count Mountain](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m42s)

[Dew okay we'll continue but as I was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m47s)

[going through this I discovered](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m51s)

[something uh even more that I have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m53s)

[apparently missed as I got all the way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m55s)

[down here and they they start talking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m57s)

[about oh okay you know here's the these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h03m58s)

[different major uh testing frameworks](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m01s)

[and here's how to use all of them and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m03s)

[was like okay that's kind of cool t-unit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m04s)

[looks really really cool we might we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m07s)

[might play around with it we'll see how](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m09s)

[things go tonight um because it looks](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m11s)

[like a cool like there haven't been a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m14s)

[lot of testing frameworks that have come](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m16s)

[out in recent years because there's kind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m18s)

[of the big names out there and why would](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m21s)

[you go with a new one unless it offers](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m22s)

[something kind of cool unit's got some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m24s)

[cool offerings so we might take a look](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m26s)

[at it but I I got down to XUnit and I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m28s)

[like "Okay let's let's see how I do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m30s)

[this." And and then I come across this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m32s)

[line](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m34s)

[here with the release of XUnit V3 and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m35s)

[went "I'm sorry hold up." Like I was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m39s)

[aware that XUnit V3 has been in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m42s)

[development for a long time like years](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m44s)

[and I was like wait I'm sorry what i I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m48s)

[was shocked to discover that XUnit v3](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m53s)

[has finally](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m56s)

[launched this makes me excited uh partly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h04m57s)

[because if you leave me alone and tell](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m00s)

[me to write a test project I'm probably](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m02s)

[going to pick XUnit like all the testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m04s)

[frameworks are kind of pretty close in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m06s)

[feature parity um there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m08s)

[personal preference that goes into](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m10s)

[picking one like before there used to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m12s)

[good reasons to pick one or the other](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m14s)

[but XUnit tends to be fairly good tends](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m16s)

[to be really extendable and I frankly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m19s)

[like the way the API feels right like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m21s)

[again there's a lot of personal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m24s)

[preference in it it's like I like the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m25s)

[way an XUnit setup works the only thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m27s)

[that gets weird is with like the sync](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m30s)

[lifetime but eh I can I can overlook](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m31s)

[that in exchange for the rest of the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m34s)

[stuff that I like like okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m36s)

[great right so there's a nice migration](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m38s)

[guide and I'm like this is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m40s)

[this one actually makes me really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m42s)

[excited because the number of times I've](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m44s)

[seen this bite people mostly because if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m46s)

[you do an await inside of a void method](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m48s)

[Visual Studio likes to just tack the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m51s)

[async keyword on there and it's real](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m53s)

[easy to miss that that was a change that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m55s)

[got made on your behalf and not realize](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h05m57s)

[that you have made a mistake so that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m00s)

[kind of a a cool change um and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m04s)

[there's a whole bunch of things here and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m07s)

[the the big one is all of these packages](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m10s)

[right is we now have you you ch and part](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m13s)

[of why I missed it is the the no is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m16s)

[the package ended up changing right so I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m20s)

[can't do this let's try this again there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m25s)

[we go is from xunit to xunit.feed3 so if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m27s)

[you're like me and running dependabot or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m31s)

[similar on your projects you will not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m33s)

[get a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m35s)

[notification that there is a new xunit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m36s)

[because it is a different nougat package](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m39s)

[so effectively with all of the packages](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m42s)

[you end up just tacking the v3 onto the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m45s)

[the name of it and you should be good to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m48s)

[go right and then there's justification](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m50s)

[down here of of why the the rename uh of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m53s)

[going through and doing and then this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h06m57s)

[also another thing so something um MTP](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m00s)

[did that XUnit V3 did and this was one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m03s)

[of the features of XUnit V3 that I was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m05s)

[kind of excited and looking forward to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m07s)

[is this output type of exe so before a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m09s)

[testing project was just a DLL right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m13s)

[which is fine but it meant that to to to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m16s)

[like run the test you needed a runner](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m19s)

[something that would load up that DL](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m21s)

[inspect it with reflection and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m24s)

[execute the test that it finds right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m26s)

[with MTP and XUnit V3 that's no longer](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m29s)

[the case right you can just output an XC](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m33s)

[and then you can take that XE and you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m37s)

[can go and run it right this also makes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m39s)

[being able to compile your tests and run](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m43s)

[your tests much simpler right so you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m45s)

[just got an exi to run nothing fancy uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m50s)

[to be able to go through and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m53s)

[there's there's some target framework](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m54s)

[stuff so if you are supporting older](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m55s)

[frameworks um this may be problematic](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h07m57s)

[for some people but frankly if you are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m00s)

[on anything that resembles modern got to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m03s)

[remember how to do this right um if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m06s)

[you're on anything that resembles modern](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m10s)

[net framework 472 net six or later right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m12s)

[like if you are on that should be good](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m16s)

[if you are on an out of support](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m20s)

[framework well we might have to talk](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m21s)

[right that that's going to end up being](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m23s)

[a um that's a that's a big deal right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m25s)

[and then um this abstraction](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m29s)

[packages and now that we aren't doing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m33s)

[that weird back and forth going between](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m36s)

[like the reflection and the runner and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m38s)

[the test and all of that stuff since now](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m40s)

[those are all just one uh yeah the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m43s)

[package just dies right and there are a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m45s)

[um a handful of type things but you can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h08m49s)

[like I don't think I've ever used any of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m09s)

[those interfaces for anything so don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m12s)

[think it's going to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m16s)

[um a big change](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m20s)

[some overloads again I don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m31s)

[think this is going to bite many people](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m34s)

[with the the changes there because I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m36s)

[don't think at least for me I have not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m39s)

[written a lot of custom ones so it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m41s)

[great um okay so here's what I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m43s)

[thinking here's what I am thinking i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m47s)

[would like one to migrate the material](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m49s)

[design project to XUnit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m52s)

[would like to turn on MPP and take it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h09m58s)

[we're going i'm thinking that's where](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m02s)

[we're going so step one one figure out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m04s)

[why the heck this thing has a yellow](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m08s)

[triangle](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m11s)

[uh let's see here oh system http i hate](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m14s)

[these i hate these so we need to bump](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m18s)

[both of these up so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m20s)

[um one's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m23s)

[here need to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m27s)

[be 434 so system net http and I might](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m30s)

[just do this manually because I don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m34s)

[like the way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m43s)

[434 we already have 434 oh this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m50s)

[transitive so this just needs to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m53s)

[explicit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m57s)

[okay got it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h10m58s)

[that'll make that green check mark go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m02s)

[away because I was like we already we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m04s)

[already have 434 brought in like most of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m05s)

[the time I don't have to deal with these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m08s)

[yellow check marks because it's unusual](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m10s)

[to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m12s)

[have and I assume 431 on the reg x1 is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m13s)

[probably the same 431 yeah I've already](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m18s)

[got latest so install that one there yep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m20s)

[yep yep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m24s)

[vulnerable](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m30s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m32s)

[hopefully my diff on this just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m33s)

[shows my big head to the other side okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m40s)

[so the diff here should just be adding](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m43s)

[these package references so for people](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m45s)

[unfamiliar with this setup um and why](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m47s)

[there's no version numbers here because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m50s)

[we are using a feature called](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h11m52s)

[feature of XUnit V3 that we may go and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m40s)

[look at is um the ability to set a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m42s)

[random seed for your tests um because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m46s)

[it's nice to be able to execute your](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m50s)

[tests in uh a random order that way if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m52s)

[there is a dependency on your test you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m56s)

[start to find it but what you don't want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m57s)

[is just random failure on your pipeline](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h13m59s)

[and not being able to reproduce locally](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h14m02s)

[dependabot um I know why you aren't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h16m49s)

[updating okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h16m54s)

[so we are going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h16m56s)

[to not upgrade all of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m00s)

[these yeah well so we're going to take a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m07s)

[couple of these so community toolkit we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m11s)

[are going to update](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m13s)

[because that one I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m14s)

[know it would be cool but my SSL sword](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m22s)

[expired yesterday and that led me down a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m24s)

[path of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h17m26s)

[stop there for now okay so step one we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m02s)

[are going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m06s)

[to start by just trying to go to XUnit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m07s)

[V3 on one of the simpler projects and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m11s)

[think colors WPF test this is probably](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m19s)

[the easiest project to update because it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m23s)

[has a smalish number of tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m25s)

[by smallalish I mean](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m28s)

[like I don't know small small digit um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m30s)

[why okay this while we're in here we're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h18m36s)

[giving all the analyzers that make life](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m21s)

[easy uh I had a confusing day with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m25s)

[styles when using the dragables tab](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m27s)

[control yeah I apologize Izzy if you're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m30s)

[still using the dragables tab control I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m33s)

[might suggest migrating off of it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m36s)

[i I don't have a good migration target](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m39s)

[for you but it it is owned by the same](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m42s)

[guy who started the material design](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m46s)

[project and he has not updated it in and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m48s)

[so unfortunately draggables made some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m51s)

[assumptions on like resource names](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m54s)

[inside the material design library and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m56s)

[have not backported stuff to support it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h20m59s)

[because I don't have I don't have access](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m02s)

[PRs don't get merged so I it's kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m05s)

[just fallen out of support](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m08s)

[um I think we even whacked it we whack](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m10s)

[it from the demo here can't remember](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m14s)

[talked about whacking it from demo at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m18s)

[one oh nope it's still in there still in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m20s)

[there so if you yeah if you are running](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m24s)

[into it one thing to be aware of and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m26s)

[think it's here there in the the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m29s)

[draggables demo there is things like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m31s)

[this where it makes assumptions on there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m35s)

[being like a secondary accent brush](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m37s)

[which doesn't exist anymore at least not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m40s)

[under this key um and so in order to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m42s)

[make it actually render](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m46s)

[properly I I have to wire up on my new](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m47s)

[theming APIs and then populate re](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m50s)

[with the key the dragable expect](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m54s)

[uh from one of the issues yeah that that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h21m58s)

[is unfortunately probably the path of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m03s)

[least](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m05s)

[resistance uh unfortunately at at some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m08s)

[point I may go as far as to kill the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m11s)

[dragables one off i've been mildly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m13s)

[hesitant because I once I kill it off I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m15s)

[kind of want to have a migration thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m18s)

[for people to go to instead because I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m21s)

[think most people are using it just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m23s)

[because they want a reorderable tab](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m24s)

[control like I think that's in a lot of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m27s)

[cases what they're after the reorderable](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m29s)

[um reorderable list box and whatnot uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m34s)

[go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m37s)

[WP for for most things this is my go-to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m39s)

[uh light mode foreground color oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m47s)

[okay i will check that in the demo and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m51s)

[see for most of the stuff this is this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m54s)

[is my go-to for doing it the only thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h22m56s)

[that is missing is you you have to tweak](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m00s)

[a handful of styles to make it look nice](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m03s)

[in the material design stuff but it's it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m06s)

[is a nice reasonable library so if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m08s)

[you're just using it to be able to like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m10s)

[drag tabs around](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m11s)

[right yeah the demo works oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m14s)

[interesting what the issue is there then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m20s)

[but yeah in a lot of cases if somebody](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m22s)

[tells me they're doing WPF like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m24s)

[reordering stuff this is this is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m26s)

[library I point them to because this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m28s)

[uh maintained by the same guy who does](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m31s)

[MA apps and he keeps it up to date and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m33s)

[so you can see you know he hasn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m36s)

[touched it in the last few months but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m38s)

[you know touched it in the last few](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m40s)

[months most of the time libraries like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m41s)

[this unless you're adding features don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m43s)

[need a lot of upkeep you know just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m45s)

[dealing with dependencies new .NET](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m47s)

[frameworks etc etc etc okay so this guy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m49s)

[ran](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m53s)

[now this is the one that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m55s)

[problematic the custom style sets the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h23m59s)

[foreground instead of letting it be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m01s)

[inherited](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m05s)

[oh yes that is probably very very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m07s)

[true](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m14s)

[yeah that I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m15s)

[believe um okay so issue here is this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m19s)

[guy is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m24s)

[wanting a rid to know what this is um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m26s)

[just get away with this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m31s)

[i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m34s)

[think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m35s)

[uh what is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m37s)

[right actually why do we need this to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m40s)

[windows trying to remember what is in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m42s)

[this project that requires window at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m45s)

[all I think it's only because the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m49s)

[colors project itself is declared](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m52s)

[windows but I honestly don't remember](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m56s)

[what in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h24m59s)

[here requires](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m00s)

[that not interested in changing TFMs of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m04s)

[the source project](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m07s)

[though light mode ended up with white on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m10s)

[white yep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m13s)

[yep that will absolutely do it to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m18s)

[you what ended up being the fix was it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m24s)

[just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m26s)

[um watching for the theme change and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m27s)

[toggling the foreground](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m31s)

[manually or something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m33s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m37s)

[okay let's see i do want to rev this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m40s)

[one and I I I do wonder if I'm about to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m46s)

[get bit by](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h25m49s)

[um don't like how this thing does this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m02s)

[you have one vulnerable package okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m05s)

[show it to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m07s)

[me um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m10s)

[transitive all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m14s)

[there okay now I have to remember the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m21s)

[the appropriate RID to put on this i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m24s)

[think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m26s)

[um should build](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m29s)

[properly uh let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m33s)

[see i want to look at this and see what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m37s)

[they support inside of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m41s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m46s)

[Uh unit v3 claimed to support net 6](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m49s)

[didn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m53s)

[they am I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h26m57s)

[crazy um oh look at that 2.0 dropped net](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m02s)

[6 oh you jerks](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m09s)

[you jerks when is net 6 end of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m14s)

[life](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m18s)

[12th got it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m38s)

[well now that uh yeah it is and that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m42s)

[is that makes for something very very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m47s)

[interesting do I kill](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m51s)

[it do I kill it now or do I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h27m55s)

[wait so if I kill it I kind of have to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m02s)

[major version rev](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m05s)

[don't know how I feel about that i don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m11s)

[know because I was only looking to get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m14s)

[up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m17s)

[to Let's do this let's look at because I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m19s)

[think this one probably supports it yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m24s)

[so I can go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m27s)

[1.1.0 let's do that for now because I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m29s)

[trying to I don't I don't want to have a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m31s)

[a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m33s)

[uh I feel a V6 coming yeah you're not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m35s)

[wrong Izzy but I don't know that I want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m38s)

[to do that in this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m40s)

[PR i think I think that's the kicker is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m41s)

[I don't mind revving it but I'm already](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m45s)

[talking about changing the the target](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m49s)

[framework that we're using followed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m52s)

[closely by](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h28m55s)

[um changing the the test runner as well](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m00s)

[so it's like I kind of feel like maybe I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m03s)

[don't do that all in one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m06s)

[go okay this should now restore this and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m09s)

[then we can probably kill off net](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m12s)

[six there look at that restore just fine](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m16s)

[okay so the short version though is I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m20s)

[think my test explorer if I look at this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m23s)

[guy I can probably run my colors](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m26s)

[test interesting that it only shows the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m35s)

[net 8 one even on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m38s)

[here i wonder if this thing's going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m45s)

[get really confused there it goes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m47s)

[run okay so that was that was a fairly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h29m56s)

[um should bump version numbering to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m02s)

[match net versions oh dear heavens like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m04s)

[that is one of the things](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m06s)

[that I am mildly torn about that because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m08s)

[on one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m12s)

[hand if you drop a framework that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m13s)

[probably counts as a major version](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m16s)

[rev but that means for net core stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m19s)

[you are revving major versions a lot and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m21s)

[some people get really twitchy and have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m24s)

[policies around major version revs and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m26s)

[I feel weird if my library itself has no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m28s)

[breaking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m32s)

[changes aside from dropping a framework](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m32s)

[like it feels weird to do that like I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m35s)

[get it but if somebody's still on like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m38s)

[net framework revving my major version](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m41s)

[has little to no effect to them it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m44s)

[like ah maybe I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m47s)

[don't I don't know i don't know okay so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m50s)

[let's do the next test project because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m54s)

[that that one went swimmingly let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m55s)

[let's do it again so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h30m59s)

[take this go to the test project we're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m01s)

[gonna get rid of both of those and go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m04s)

[whoop and this is where we kill off I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m07s)

[think sta fact](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m11s)

[dies but maybe we should do a brief](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m14s)

[gander at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m17s)

[nougat just to just to make sure that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m20s)

[there isn't like an sta fact](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m23s)

[v3 uh there is a preview](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m26s)

[package there's a 1269](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m29s)

[uh blah blah blah blah blah blah let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m35s)

[take a look let's take a brief gander](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m38s)

[two months ago](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m42s)

[uh let's see for xunit v3 support use](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m45s)

[xunit sta fact 2.x well that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m48s)

[convenient thank you so I need a 2.x](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m52s)

[version uh 2.x is in preview](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h31m57s)

[great update](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m03s)

[please okay that gets me to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m14s)

[there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m16s)

[lovely sorry just checking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m19s)

[on spam](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m25s)

[that gets me to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m28s)

[there let's see this should have revved](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m31s)

[my STA fact](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m35s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m39s)

[great that gets me to there and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m41s)

[uh let's see are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m48s)

[you dependencies are done build like it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m50s)

[feels like upgrading](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m54s)

[to XUnit V3 is a almost a drop in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h32m56s)

[replacement unless you've done something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m00s)

[very custom and I haven't done much](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m01s)

[custom on this project there's a handful](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m04s)

[of ones where I have written like my own](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m06s)

[uh xUnit attributes and I'll be curious](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m10s)

[how those ones go but I don't think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m12s)

[they're going to be that bad oh yep yep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m14s)

[yep yep right forgot about that output](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m16s)

[type XE](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m19s)

[i got you i got](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m22s)

[you that anything](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m24s)

[else enim data attribute is not a class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m26s)

[oh maybe we did do a custom one here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m31s)

[okay so this guy here is just a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m34s)

[namespace](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m37s)

[update and then what is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m39s)

[uh there's new APIs here implement](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m43s)

[abstract class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m46s)

[so supports discovery](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m49s)

[enumeration huh i wonder what that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m52s)

[means](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h33m55s)

[um have to go look that up in just a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m01s)

[second but let's migrate this down so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m04s)

[that goes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m06s)

[there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m07s)

[and I cannot implicitly convert oh this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m12s)

[supports Oh this supports awaitable now](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m17s)

[that's nice that's nice because value](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m19s)

[tasks are meant for methods that are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m22s)

[likely synchronous return but could be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m25s)

[awaited if necessary so they are they](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m27s)

[are much more efficient because they are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m31s)

[a strct not a class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m33s)

[and so in the case where you're just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m36s)

[going to synchronously return they are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m37s)

[much more efficient but they can cast](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m40s)

[themsel into a task if um actual async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m42s)

[code is necessary so they're actually](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m47s)

[slightly slower if they do hit the async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m49s)

[case so you don't just blindly use them](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m51s)

[everywhere](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m53s)

[um actually I guess what we can do is we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h34m58s)

[can probably just do this right uh let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m00s)

[see hold on it wants a theory data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m05s)

[row oh got it uh yep that goes something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m09s)

[like this and then this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m15s)

[new theory](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m18s)

[data data row](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m22s)

[base theory data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m25s)

[row uh I think we want the generic](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m28s)

[I think this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m37s)

[guy's does not an abstract](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m39s)

[right uh nope nope nope](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m45s)

[nope what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m50s)

[is Well we might just look at what this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m55s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h35m57s)

[returns be data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m00s)

[romp](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m05s)

[implementation anybody wants an easy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m12s)

[poll request theory data row base.cs TS](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m19s)

[um and then you are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m29s)

[just object so in theory we can get away](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m33s)

[with this but I there there's probably a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m37s)

[more efficient way of going about doing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m40s)

[this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m42s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m47s)

[uh oh so we don't need this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m49s)

[anymore this just literally becomes this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m57s)

[new data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h36m58s)

[row all right so that gets me to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m00s)

[there then what is your problem uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m03s)

[cannot](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m06s)

[convert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m07s)

[from I innumerable](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m10s)

[Oh because it's there uh let's see i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m18s)

[think we can just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m22s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m24s)

[right data row here we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m31s)

[go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m34s)

[uh that is known to be serializable it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m39s)

[is serializable uh supports discovery](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m42s)

[enumeration true i think right answer](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m47s)

[worst case scenario uh the answer is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m50s)

[false okay what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m53s)

[else errors in the current compile](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h37m58s)

[why did we lose our reference](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m14s)

[to all of this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m17s)

[stuff i lost all system.winds i lost](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m22s)

[dependency object the heck did I change](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m26s)

[uh this is why we have git oh what did I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m29s)

[break in here uh oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m33s)

[that's what I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m41s)

[broke](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m43s)

[um okay so this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m44s)

[becomes must add a reference to uh see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m53s)

[and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m56s)

[can't do that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h38m57s)

[um but what I can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m01s)

[do what I can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m03s)

[do use](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m06s)

[WPF true that should get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m10s)

[me dependencies that I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m14s)

[need ah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m17s)

[go okay so that gets me to there and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m20s)

[then did I have global](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m23s)

[using did](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m25s)

[okay okay so that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m37s)

[files test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m43s)

[explorer try this again i'm kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m46s)

[curious what that enume one is going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m49s)

[do let's run the WPF side of the fence](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h39m50s)

[feels faster i don't have any metrics to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m03s)

[say one way or the other at a minimum](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m05s)

[the updates here are s it it seems like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m08s)

[like my test runner is updating a lot](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m12s)

[quicker if it's running more things in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m20s)

[parallel](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m22s)

[the fact that we're sitting there okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m26s)

[all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m28s)

[compiles compiles test run what more](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m29s)

[could you ask for okay let's kill off](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m32s)

[the last one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m35s)

[then uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m36s)

[so come in here we just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m39s)

[need](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m42s)

[changes uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m46s)

[i would like to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m50s)

[change those two](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m52s)

[out then I don't think I want the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h40m58s)

[abstractions as a global anymore because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m00s)

[I believe that was one of the ones that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m03s)

[was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m07s)

[uh yeah removal of that so we don't want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m14s)

[a global using for something that's no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m18s)

[longer](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m19s)

[there and then we're just we're just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m21s)

[going to build it oh wait i'm an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m23s)

[idiot i cannot remember how to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m25s)

[set output type](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m29s)

[exe yep yep yep yep yep i get it xunit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m31s)

[you're unhappy i'm an idiot i'm not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m34s)

[following](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m36s)

[directions test base does not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m37s)

[implement blah blah blah blah blah oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m41s)

[right they Let me go back migration docs](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m43s)

[they had something about the IA async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m47s)

[lifetime let's see defines its own](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m50s)

[dispose async uh we would call both now](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m53s)

[inherits from I async disposable so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m57s)

[dispose async comes from there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h41m59s)

[um you should only call one or the other](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m03s)

[not both for xunit we will call dispose](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m05s)

[async but not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m08s)

[dispose got it okay so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m10s)

[guy here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m16s)

[had](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m18s)

[that and this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m21s)

[is the initialize oh so they just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m26s)

[converted to value task got it got it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m28s)

[got it got it got it got it and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m30s)

[shouldn't say they converted they they](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m33s)

[switched to using the built-in one um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m35s)

[and this one here it's a little](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m38s)

[disappointing that this is value task](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m40s)

[because this is guaranteed to go async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m42s)

[um this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m45s)

[not in fact it's actually unlikely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m50s)

[to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m53s)

[um not overly concerned with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h42m58s)

[implementing the disposable pattern on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m00s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m02s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m10s)

[wow there is a huge number of warnings](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m12s)

[in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m16s)

[here calls to methods which accept](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m18s)

[cancellation token should use test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m21s)

[context current cancellation token hoy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m23s)

[ve Hoy ve like this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m26s)

[nice but hoy ve that is going to be a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m32s)

[lot of changes throughout my tests okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m35s)

[we are not going to wait to do all of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m38s)

[these because this is if anybody wants](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m41s)

[to earn some free PR points uh this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m44s)

[going to get merged and all of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m48s)

[warnings are going to need cleaning and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m50s)

[it's going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m52s)

[be a lot of rinse and repeat especially](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m53s)

[in the UI test because the UI tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m56s)

[have well every method to ZAML test is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h43m59s)

[an async call](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m02s)

[so every single invocation of ZAML test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m04s)

[will do it okay well the good news is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m07s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m10s)

[compiled which if we want to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m11s)

[absolutely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m14s)

[certain we kill this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m15s)

[off and with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h44m19s)

[cannot run in parallel i want to make](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h45m13s)

[changed between okay good that's the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h45m17s)

[in parallel like it it has to be one or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h45m27s)

[the other because you have one keyboard](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h45m29s)

[and one mouse](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h45m31s)

[we ran it before depending on which](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m10s)

[target framework we're talking about was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m13s)

[range](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m21s)

[which shocking to me that net 6 was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m23s)

[faster than the other](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m26s)

[ones but that could be an artifact or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m28s)

[similar so this is not scientific this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m31s)

[is going to be a how good does it feel](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h46m34s)

[needs to be restarted at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h48m33s)

[it right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h48m40s)

[so before the numbers showed 14 to 18](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h48m42s)

[um Oh 1713 that's another thing that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m03s)

[doesn't work since yesterday too oh boy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m06s)

[i am sorry Izzy you are correct](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m09s)

[everything has gone wrong for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m11s)

[you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m14s)

[um yeah so I am I am tempted to give](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m18s)

[this guy a a run so let's let's go here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m21s)

[right because this is as small of a test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m24s)

[project as I can possibly get um and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m26s)

[then there was some nice documentation](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m30s)

[uh here specifically for migrating from](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m36s)

[XUnit right so install the TUNT test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m40s)

[pack or TUNT package in your test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m44s)

[project](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m47s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m49s)

[uh if you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h55m55s)

[have unit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m02s)

[or got it okay so the package adds some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m09s)

[global using](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m13s)

[um oh Visual Studio uses the 12x version](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m17s)

[of Newtonoft oh no oh no oh no oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m20s)

[no oh I am very very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m26s)

[sorry okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m30s)

[so let's start](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m32s)

[here because apparently step one is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m35s)

[install these ones but uh let's see net](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m38s)

[add tunit right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m49s)

[oh module initialize see this just so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m51s)

[exciting to me so much happiness uh you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m54s)

[probably use the package this should not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h56m58s)

[be used with TUnit it'll stop the test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m00s)

[discovery from working properly okay so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m02s)

[I need to in include TUnit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m05s)

[and this assumes non this is this kind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m08s)

[of method of doing this is a way that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m12s)

[people have done centralized package man](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m14s)

[before centralized package management](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m16s)

[was a thing so I'm I get that people do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m18s)

[it that way but uh no we're not doing it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m21s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m24s)

[way come on okay so let's go here T](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m25s)

[unit because this like in looking at it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m30s)

[I have high hopes like this packet this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m34s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m39s)

[framework at least on paper has all the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m40s)

[things of being my new](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m43s)

[favorite it looks very good so I'm kind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m46s)

[of hoping that I'm hoping it lives up to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m50s)

[the hype okay so we've done that now we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m53s)

[go back to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h57m57s)

[migration uh okay but we need to add in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m01s)

[this using remove for the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m05s)

[moment because we have added these in we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m08s)

[are going to come in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m12s)

[here uh actually I guess we can actually](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m13s)

[put it here right so just temporary just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m16s)

[so we can have analyzers work properly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m19s)

[uh oh I guess that's a that's not the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m23s)

[right I should put it in its own item](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m25s)

[group okay so we will](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m28s)

[remove unit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m32s)

[core we may end up wanting to do this as](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m39s)

[well but we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m41s)

[start simple right so there's that okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m43s)

[and then rebuild the project](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m47s)

[uh have been restored and analyzer](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m51s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m53s)

[loaded](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h58m55s)

[uh oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m01s)

[sweet this leverages net](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m04s)

[format analyzes oh this is cool okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m07s)

[we're going to close Visual Studio for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m10s)

[this we're going to close Visual so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m12s)

[uh let's see how dangerous do kippos are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m18s)

[um I believe very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m22s)

[dangerous let's see today's task is to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m25s)

[build VMs with everything in and migrate](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m28s)

[them while I flatten the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m30s)

[server](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m32s)

[dang oh thank you for the follow i I I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m37s)

[will admit I think this is the first](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m40s)

[time I've got a follow by answering a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m42s)

[question about](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m43s)

[hippos uh let's see and then we want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m45s)

[go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m49s)

[to tests and then we want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m50s)

[the colors](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m55s)

[tests and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=00h59m57s)

[then Okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m00s)

[so we would like to run these in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m03s)

[order and we're just going to send it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m07s)

[see what happens](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m11s)

[hypothetically if someone would have had](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m18s)

[hiccups constantly non-stop for three](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m20s)

[months is that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m22s)

[that has ever happened to me but I don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m26s)

[know that I am qualified to say whether](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m28s)

[that is normal or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m30s)

[not okay so there's 52](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m35s)

[53 okay we're gonna we're just going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m45s)

[keep running all these things i do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m47s)

[wonder if this is this analyzes one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m49s)

[going to do anything we only added the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m52s)

[one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m53s)

[package going to keep these ones in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h00m55s)

[mind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m00s)

[um we only added the main package so I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m02s)

[wondering if these ones are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m05s)

[necessary it is I will say if this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m09s)

[applying the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m14s)

[diagnostics this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m15s)

[absolute so I'm kind of hoping what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m21s)

[happens is I open my diff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m23s)

[up something changed something's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m26s)

[changed look at that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m32s)

[it updated my code for me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m35s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m38s)

[oh you are very close](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h01m40s)

[did](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m25s)

[that uh let's see here so boom](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m28s)

[boom powered by Copilot](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m32s)

[v1.0](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m35s)

[uh okay so there's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m38s)

[that and so because here's the thing is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m41s)

[I think we can get rid of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m43s)

[Shidley i I think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m45s)

[like your Nougat packages faster restore](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m48s)

[faster execution like everything sounds](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m51s)

[good to me perform manual bits that are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m54s)

[still necessary remove the XUnit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m57s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h02m59s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m01s)

[Xunit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m04s)

[goodbye i'll miss you oh and we know we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m06s)

[want to remove this one as](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m09s)

[well](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m12s)

[okay next step uh revert step one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m14s)

[okay done hopefully right and here's the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m21s)

[manual steps of of needing to execute](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m26s)

[these things okay so that went there do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m28s)

[you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m31s)

[build that is step](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m32s)

[one compilation is important uh we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m35s)

[apparently did not clear out all of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m39s)

[these okay okay and some of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m43s)

[assertions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m45s)

[uh assert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m51s)

[that contrast](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m55s)

[ratio i think it's getting very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h03m58s)

[confused okay I need to look at the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m04s)

[syntax here for this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m06s)

[writing your first](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m09s)

[test like the important thing here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m11s)

[assert that result that result is equal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m14s)

[to okay got it assert that contrast](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m17s)

[ratio is greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m20s)

[than well I think I want is greater than](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m24s)

[or equal to right is greater than or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m26s)

[equal to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m28s)

[2.9 right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m30s)

[booms statements must be awaited](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m35s)

[Really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m47s)

[interesting not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m49s)

[100% not entirely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m54s)

[100% sure why my assertions are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m57s)

[awaitable but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h04m59s)

[okay great](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m01s)

[build i think that that means this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m03s)

[probably wrong well no because this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m06s)

[using shouldly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m09s)

[so I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m11s)

[think right so assert that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m12s)

[uh contains black](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m23s)

[false right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m24s)

[like oh and I need to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m29s)

[await task okay so this so converting to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m33s)

[the to the assertions are going to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m37s)

[the killer of this I think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m40s)

[um and that's probably one of the things](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m45s)

[that got it confused is that it was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m48s)

[looking for xunit assertions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m51s)

[uh through and it did not find](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m54s)

[them okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h05m57s)

[so this this makes me this makes me very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h06m00s)

[in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m18s)

[here oh I'm I I think I think I love it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m20s)

[i think I love it look at that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m26s)

[compiled that was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m28s)

[fast that was fast we still](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m31s)

[have the net 6 window](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m34s)

[problem like I think we are going to end](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m38s)

[up having to kill net 6 but let's go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m40s)

[here right so previous execution was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m43s)

[like 1.3 and 800](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m47s)

[milliseconds so if we run](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m50s)

[this what does it do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m53s)

[that was not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m58s)

[too more importantly we got a failure on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h07m59s)

[one of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m02s)

[them no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m05s)

[references what did more importantly how](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m07s)

[is this a failure on only one of the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m10s)

[platform just on net 8](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m16s)

[huh that makes me suspect](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m19s)

[uh you're telling me this includes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m24s)

[gray okay now I'm really Now I'm really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m33s)

[suspect what's going on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m36s)

[here run them](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m39s)

[again run them again i am noticing the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m43s)

[net six ones don't even appear to run](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m47s)

[this test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m49s)

[there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m55s)

[is there is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h08m57s)

[something that is biting me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m00s)

[here i think that they are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m06s)

[executing either faster slower in a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m10s)

[different order something and we have a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m13s)

[static or similar that is biting me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m17s)

[is the fact that this is the the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m21s)

[standard thing yeah okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m24s)

[something right so in a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m27s)

[set periodic failures that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m32s)

[is that is a new level of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m36s)

[exciting i mean it's it's fast i'll give](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m44s)

[it that but I'm I'm wondering if this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m47s)

[is too](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m52s)

[fast okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h09m55s)

[um see if I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m01s)

[do one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m04s)

[here can I get away with just this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m07s)

[now the compiler can figure it out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m13s)

[it's kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m17s)

[dirty okay so what what would be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m20s)

[failing i guess I want to get back into](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m23s)

[a failing state on one of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m26s)

[these watch now that I'm now that I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m28s)

[looking at it I won't be able to get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m30s)

[into that failing state there we go okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m31s)

[so no reference](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m35s)

[exception where swatch provider](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m39s)

[read application load](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m43s)

[thread](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m57s)

[safe is that is that my is that the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h10m59s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m02s)

[because in most cases this would not be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m07s)

[a a method that you could invoke like at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m12s)

[in a real app this is something that has](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m15s)

[to be invoked on the your UI](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m18s)

[thread and so it would be very very very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m20s)

[unlikely to have this to have a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m26s)

[threading problem there because only one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m29s)

[thread can invoke it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m40s)

[note well that is pretty](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m43s)

[conclusive that is very very conclusive](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m47s)

[so the test caught a bug let's see not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m56s)

[no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h11m58s)

[not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m08s)

[red uh so we need to create a new](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m11s)

[instance each time no no copilot you're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m14s)

[so silly you're so silly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m17s)

[uh so private static read only sync lock](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m19s)

[new](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m27s)

[right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m29s)

[oh that's not proper syntax that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m30s)

[better and then if we lock on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m33s)

[this yeah that that be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m40s)

[better boom](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m44s)

[that look at that we're going to fix a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m48s)

[bug and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m50s)

[everything new test framework and it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m52s)

[found a bug now the problem is is I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m54s)

[don't know how many times I need to run](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m56s)

[this before I convince myself that it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m57s)

[that it's good because I think we saw](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h12m59s)

[five or six passes in a row](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m01s)

[before it feels really fast to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m09s)

[running these things like this oh man](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m12s)

[this this this feels like a framework I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m15s)

[can get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m18s)

[behind this feels like a framework I can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m19s)

[get behind i I think I'm in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m22s)

[love i I I think I'm in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m25s)

[love i I like I like new](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m28s)

[testing so pretty and I like the idea of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m35s)

[needing fewer libraries like this just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m38s)

[it feels good](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m41s)

[this is a diff the the the needing to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m44s)

[await it is definitely something I did](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m47s)

[not catch when I was reading](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m49s)

[this but there's there's a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m51s)

[here that makes this really nice okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h13m56s)

[can you do data injectable class data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m00s)

[source](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m03s)

[uh inject new classes as parameters into](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m06s)

[your tests and or old tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m09s)

[last data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m14s)

[source oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m22s)

[really well thank you i did not realize](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m25s)

[that now now I'm actually tempted to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m27s)

[it i'm I'm wondering if this thing is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m30s)

[actually taking my my system settings oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m32s)

[you're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m35s)

[right oh wow when I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m36s)

[hit When I hit run I do watch my frame](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m39s)

[rate drop holy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m43s)

[crap what is this thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m44s)

[doing oh it is aggressive okay thank you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m49s)

[for the heads up yeah and I I completely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m52s)

[agree i love async and await i'm just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m56s)

[not used to needing to await my assert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h14m58s)

[calls that part is that part is I think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m01s)

[new and unique to this i do like this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m03s)

[class data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m08s)

[source but this is this is for like um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m12s)

[web application factory which is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m16s)

[commonly used when you're doing ASP.NET](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m17s)

[core and you want to do um kind of end](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m20s)

[to end I shouldn't say end to end when](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m23s)

[you want to do actual functional tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m25s)

[because this will stand up your uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m28s)

[typically a web API in an in-memory](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m30s)

[Kestrel instance and then run your tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m32s)

[against that so you can actually test um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m34s)

[your your web API in a real u invocation](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m37s)

[scenario to make sure that like your](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m42s)

[parameters are all serializable and you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m44s)

[know if I hit it with the following](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m46s)

[payload do I do I hit the right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m48s)

[controller method does my routing work](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m49s)

[properly does my off work properly it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m51s)

[can let you get away with all of that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h15m53s)

[um yeah and it could be the GPU for me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m00s)

[like I my graphics card is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m03s)

[not is not is not my strong point right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m06s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m11s)

[uh so if people are interested like I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m13s)

[don't my machine isn't tiny but it's not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m16s)

[it's not an OP machine by by any stretch](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m18s)

[of the imagination where's my graphics](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m22s)

[card](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m23s)

[why is it not here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m37s)

[chip am I blind or stupid](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m42s)

[oh it'll be in task manag](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h16m57s)

[uh let's see here because you're talking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m03s)

[about over](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m05s)

[in this guy right being able to see uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m07s)

[yeah RX 580 so again it's like I don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m12s)

[do a ton of gaming so I didn't care that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m18s)

[much this machine was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m21s)

[built seven years ago for the AI craze](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m24s)

[when graphics cards were still at wildly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m28s)

[prices](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m31s)

[but not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m32s)

[inexpensive three digits in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m34s)

[the But now now that I've got this up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m42s)

[I'm actually curious to see what happens](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m45s)

[now when I hit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m46s)

[the sit here you sit here what happens](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m48s)

[oh I apologize incoming lag](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h17m52s)

[right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m02s)

[oh I wonder if it's something related to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m04s)

[how OBS is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m06s)

[capturing yeah I might run some tests on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m14s)

[that um players encoder is crap](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m17s)

[yeah now I'm going to I'll run some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m21s)

[tests after my stream is over and see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m24s)

[which one actually gives me better](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m27s)

[output on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m29s)

[that that is a good point i did not I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m30s)

[did not realize that so thank you very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m33s)

[much yeah I do I do like this test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m37s)

[framework though it just it feels nice](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m41s)

[what I want to see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m43s)

[is Yeah there okay method data](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m46s)

[source okay so additional test data blah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m49s)

[blah blah this guy goes in here does it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m53s)

[have to be a class of some kind let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h18m56s)

[see uh if you pass two arguments this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m02s)

[should should be the type of the class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m05s)

[contain the test source method and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m07s)

[second should be the name of the method](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m08s)

[right that's fine](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m10s)

[and I suspect that these are source](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m13s)

[gened in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m15s)

[so like we may test this but I I I have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m17s)

[a sinking suspicion that this will be a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m20s)

[situation where if you typo one of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m22s)

[uh it just fails to compile morning JC](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m31s)

[uh from experience 9070 XTS for the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m34s)

[encoder](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m38s)

[stuff sorry I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m39s)

[a note on that because I have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m45s)

[been hardware and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m54s)

[so or at least upgrades hardware like I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h19m58s)

[bought](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m01s)

[this expectation that it would get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m03s)

[updated at some point because when I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m05s)

[initially started streaming like my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m07s)

[streaming setup was literally held](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m08s)

[together with spare sprinkler parts it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m10s)

[was not advanced it's still not advanced](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m12s)

[i'm kind of a cheapkate when it comes to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m14s)

[this okay that is perfect matrix](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m19s)

[tests this is something that I have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m24s)

[missed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m26s)

[yeah the uh this is this is glorious](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m32s)

[because this is effectively like a a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m36s)

[cross product because as you add](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m38s)

[parameters right you can easily get into](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m42s)

[the thousands of test cases which is not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m45s)

[hard which is is definitely not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m49s)

[hard oh I run a remote transcode machine](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m53s)

[tool and then do you just like capture](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h20m57s)

[card from your main machine](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m03s)

[blade that that would](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m05s)

[uh I'd be curious how that setup goes gc](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m07s)

[at some point can you give an overview](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m11s)

[of what's happened with material design](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m13s)

[in ZAML 3 sure um I I assume](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m15s)

[specifically what you are interested in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m19s)

[is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m22s)

[um well I guess we can look at the demo](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m24s)

[right the this demo here so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m27s)

[um Google when when this project was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m31s)

[first started they were on material](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m34s)

[design v2](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m40s)

[yeah yeah the machines that make that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m42s)

[make money well and that's the thing is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m44s)

[right now this is my my personal dev](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m46s)

[machine and streaming box yeah so the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m49s)

[material design v3 stuff is an attempt](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m53s)

[to get Google's material](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m57s)

[design spec brought](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h21m59s)

[in yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m03s)

[so code design](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m05s)

[v3 right so the the M3 versus M2 and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m09s)

[they changed a handful of things but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m14s)

[they didn't change](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m17s)

[everything and so at least in terms of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m18s)

[the material design and ZAML project um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m21s)

[we went through and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m24s)

[updated a decent number of the controls](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m26s)

[um there may still be a handful that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m29s)

[don't have the material design 3 styling](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m32s)

[and if you find those feel free to open](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m34s)

[issues](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m36s)

[um but the intent was to provide an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m38s)

[alternate set of styling now the problem](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m41s)

[is people don't like it when you when](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m43s)

[you restyle all their stuff um so inside](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m46s)

[of the project when you go to launch and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m51s)

[this is something that I believe we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m55s)

[changed on the last major rev is before](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m57s)

[there used to just be a material design](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h22m59s)

[defaults one now we make you explicitly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m01s)

[pick which one you want right whether](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m04s)

[you want material design 2 or material](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m06s)

[design 3 so when you are starting and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m08s)

[doing your app your app.zaml](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m12s)

[um the collapse this right you end up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m17s)

[having to to pick which of which of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m21s)

[these guys you end up wanting whether](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m23s)

[you want the two or the three and this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m25s)

[was a breaking change that I know I got](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m27s)

[a handful of issues on despite](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m28s)

[documenting it i'm like it's going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m30s)

[break people sorry um but it was better](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m32s)

[than what we had before and at least](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m36s)

[standardized the names going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m37s)

[forward um with that said you can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m39s)

[technically mix and match between the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m42s)

[two styles if you want you just have to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m45s)

[bring in the the relevant resource](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m48s)

[dictionaries as you see fit so the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m50s)

[you'll note here the big differences](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m53s)

[between the material design 3 and the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m56s)

[material design 2 is just right here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h23m57s)

[like this is all that is functionally](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m00s)

[different the rest of it is still the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m02s)

[material design 2](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m04s)

[stuff um so there's not a ton that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m06s)

[different in there um and like I said](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m10s)

[feel free there was a It might still be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m15s)

[out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m18s)

[there i think there was a material](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m21s)

[design 3 road map this one here right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m25s)

[and this is probably giving people a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m27s)

[little bit of pause](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m29s)

[um actually this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m31s)

[done yeah both of those tasks are done i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m34s)

[just have not updated these in the case](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m38s)

[um like the the tertiary color this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m40s)

[something that material design 3 added](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m44s)

[in theory we should probably add like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m47s)

[button styles that leverage this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m50s)

[but like we're only doing that to have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m53s)

[magically named styles that have the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m56s)

[right theme brushes there's nothing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h24m58s)

[stopping you from pulling in a tertiary](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m00s)

[color today and using it in your app](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m02s)

[just like you could any other color or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m04s)

[brush but we don't have any built-in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m06s)

[controls that use it so it's kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m09s)

[been a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m10s)

[um a small sticking point um let's see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m12s)

[here the typography I might need to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m15s)

[check because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m18s)

[I I think this one's done too well I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m19s)

[need to review these um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m24s)

[uh Nikolai went through I believe at one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m27s)

[point and fixed up a lot of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m29s)

[um in terms of getting this done i think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m33s)

[when we converted this thing up we lost](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m36s)

[the state of some of these checks on the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m39s)

[boxes um so that that's currently where](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m42s)

[it sits uh for people thinking of using](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m45s)

[it there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m47s)

[is it is production ready it's shipped](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m50s)

[in the main app it is ready to go i've](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m53s)

[used it on mine the only limitation is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m56s)

[there may be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h25m58s)

[uh missing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m00s)

[elements right like that I think is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m02s)

[only thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m04s)

[um Oh cool thank Thank you uh the angel](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m07s)

[blade I think it's short for one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m12s)

[uh but yeah uh let's see uh I can or I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m17s)

[can just sambble a file over to TRC oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m22s)

[thank you for the follow uh there's an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m26s)

[app I made that runs on it that just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m28s)

[scans folder and feeds data based on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m29s)

[location metadata the Handbreak FFmpeg](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m31s)

[and a few other media tools uh server](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m33s)

[runs on Arts Linux with no UI so it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m36s)

[kind of weird that's That's not that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m38s)

[weird yeah no I appreciate the follow um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m41s)

[yeah I've actually got some GitHub](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m44s)

[action automation that runs FFmpeg stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m46s)

[secretly in my day job I do like right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m49s)

[now I'm building forensic video software](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m51s)

[so FFmpeg is my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m54s)

[friend we do a lot of it it's fun but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h26m57s)

[yeah no that at at some point I think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m02s)

[I'm going to get to that situation i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m05s)

[recently moved I realize you probably](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m07s)

[stepped away so if you catch the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m09s)

[recording you catch this or everyone](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m11s)

[else but I moved uh back in September to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m12s)

[a new place um the nice part is it had](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m15s)

[an unfinished uh basement where I get to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m18s)

[build my office the problem is it has an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m22s)

[unfinished basement that I'm still](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m24s)

[working on building my office so I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m26s)

[technically sitting there you can tell](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m28s)

[by my great green screen behind me um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m29s)

[but I've got you know open studs and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m31s)

[whatnot and things so we've been slowly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m34s)

[working on the house every weekend but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m36s)

[it's going to take a while but I am](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m38s)

[hopeful that when I get there I will](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m40s)

[finally have a nice setup yeah I I have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m42s)

[looked at Gstreamer before Izzy and it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m46s)

[it looks very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m48s)

[nice uh I'm working for GM doing PLC](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m51s)

[ladder logic](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m56s)

[garbage](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h27m59s)

[sorry do robotics see that is kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m03s)

[cool i've only ever had one project in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m07s)

[my career where I got to do robotics we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m09s)

[were building um industry uh printers](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m11s)

[for building PC which was kind of cool](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m15s)

[like there's something fun about writing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m18s)

[code for something that could](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m20s)

[theoretically kill you so at one point](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m21s)

[in time I had like a $20,000 foot stool](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m24s)

[that I was making go up and down because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m27s)

[I was testing some stepper motor stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m29s)

[like it was it was kind of fun i I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m30s)

[thoroughly enjoyed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m33s)

[myself yeah get out of here drive and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m37s)

[don't pay attention to uh stream i do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m40s)

[stuff yes Izzy you have all the fun](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m45s)

[stuff okay i think I think I absolutely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m48s)

[love this framework though i I think I'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m51s)

[Oh look at that oh I don't need the the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m54s)

[ability to generate this many tests like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h28m58s)

[I don't need this but I want it i want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m01s)

[it and this looks this looks amaz okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m04s)

[so for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m08s)

[starters one this repo does not have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m09s)

[enough stars](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m12s)

[so for anyone who hasn't given it a star](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m15s)

[at a bare minimum give this guy a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m18s)

[star yeah because this absolutely needs](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m23s)

[for what it is okay okay so I think what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m33s)

[we're going to do is we're going to do a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m37s)

[clean](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m45s)

[doesn't disappointing um I was going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m47s)

[say we we do this in several](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m50s)

[stages](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m53s)

[uh oh I have warnings as airs turned on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m55s)

[oh this is horrible this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h29m59s)

[horrible i have warnings as airs turned](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m02s)

[on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m04s)

[oh do I just suppress the warning or do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m09s)

[I actually fix this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m13s)

[garbage because the other thing is is if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m17s)

[I convert this over to the new testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m20s)

[framework I don't have to fix](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m22s)

[this uh maybe it's my autistic nature](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m28s)

[but there are just too many new shiny](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m30s)

[things that I have to be an expert in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m32s)

[all i know i know but this is this is a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m34s)

[good shiny thing i like this shiny thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m38s)

[like on one hand this is definitely like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m40s)

[something like an Xunit has been around](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m44s)

[for a lot of years and is well battle](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m47s)

[tested this has not been around for a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m50s)

[lot of years but the only way it's going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m52s)

[to be around for a lot of years is if I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m54s)

[leverage it and other people leverage it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h30m57s)

[too right like there's so much in here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m00s)

[that looks so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m03s)

[nice like this feels like somebody who](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m05s)

[built a test framework](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m08s)

[for the who who struggled with some of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m12s)

[the limitations of the other test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m14s)

[frameworks and went "Darn it I could do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m16s)

[this better if I built it from scratch."](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m18s)

[Like that feels like what this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m20s)

[is oh look at that oh look at that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m23s)

[depends on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m26s)

[oh love it love it love it love it love](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m30s)

[it uh and if your test depends on has](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m36s)

[parameters you must include the types of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m38s)

[those too oh you can do dependent](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m40s)

[dependable so this is something I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m43s)

[absolutely love](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m46s)

[this here alone might make me want to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m48s)

[this because generally you want your](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m53s)

[tests to be fast small run in isolation](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m56s)

[yada yada yada right but there are a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h31m58s)

[category of tests like UI tests uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m01s)

[oftentimes integration tests that are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m04s)

[big clunky and slow right and they are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m06s)

[that way by design but they are that way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m08s)

[to test everything all the way through](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m11s)

[rather than just individual unit tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m14s)

[right so just because you're using a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m16s)

[testing framework doesn't mean you're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m17s)

[writing unit tests sometimes they're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m18s)

[bigger tests and those bigger tests you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m20s)

[often times you don't have time to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m23s)

[restart the process to test every](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m25s)

[individual use case so a single test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m27s)

[often will have asserts at different](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m29s)

[points along the the journey to say okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m31s)

[did I log in successfully yes great did](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m33s)

[I open the user's profile page correctly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m36s)

[yes okay now I'm going to change my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m38s)

[username right those types of things are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m40s)

[oftentimes all in the test i immediately](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m42s)

[see a use case for being able to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m47s)

[depends on tests for that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m49s)

[like this feels like a great way to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m52s)

[able to structure those units of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m55s)

[work or hey this test needs to verify](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h32m57s)

[you know something after login but I can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m02s)

[shove that into a thing like we kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m04s)

[do that today by just building the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m06s)

[methods and chaining them together but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m07s)

[this feels this feels like a nice](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m10s)

[possibility or like if when you're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m12s)

[testing cases that don't matter right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m15s)

[like I'm thinking of here I'll just show](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m18s)

[it to you right So on my velop pack code](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m20s)

[right might be the other thing that I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m24s)

[that I want to leverage this for um I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m26s)

[have a set of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m29s)

[tests I finally got my Azureite](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m34s)

[container working properly i was very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m36s)

[proud of myself uh so like API service](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m37s)

[tests and let's do teams v1 v1 endpoint](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m41s)

[test right so I've got a set of tests](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m45s)

[that all do things like verify](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m48s)

[authentication see you Izzy have a good](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m51s)

[one uh see if I surface in a week um and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m53s)

[like some of these other tests don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h33m59s)

[make sense to run if this one fails](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m01s)

[right like if my off isn't working that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m03s)

[means something has broken in my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m06s)

[middleware and I can't get further down](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m08s)

[like I I don't want to even bother to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m10s)

[try right stop running](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m12s)

[like those types of situations sound](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m15s)

[really good for this right like I've got](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m17s)

[test one that's basically just hey can I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m19s)

[get there was my authentication stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m22s)

[working if the answer is no don't bother](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m24s)

[with the rest of it something higher up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m25s)

[is broken because normally what happens](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m27s)

[is without that depends upon you end up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m29s)

[getting a test log that's filled with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m32s)

[failures and you only care](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m34s)

[about effectively the root level one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m36s)

[right because sometimes you get you know](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m39s)

[hey you know 25 tests pass and you kind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m41s)

[of start to look at them and the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m43s)

[developer has to do some mental](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m44s)

[gymnastics to go well given this set of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m45s)

[failures the failure point is likely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m48s)

[here right like um the company I work](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m51s)

[for we built some software for a utility](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m54s)

[that uh helps them kind of figure out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m56s)

[given a number of outage reports what's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h34m59s)

[the likely area where the failure](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m02s)

[occurred right is there you know a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m04s)

[substation out or whatever right like it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m05s)

[kind of tries to work its way backwards](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m07s)

[that way they can dispatch crews and say](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m09s)

["Hey you probably want to start here in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m11s)

[looking for the problem right it may not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m14s)

[be right but you know here's the kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m16s)

[common points between all of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m18s)

[things look there first." Right so it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m19s)

[it's a starting point and this would](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m22s)

[help you get that starting point right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m25s)

[if you chain the test together](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m27s)

[oh loving loving loving](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m29s)

[want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h35m35s)

[I imagine inside of it to figure out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h36m32s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h36m35s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h38m30s)

[interesting i So I get the idea here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h38m32s)

[right um uh let's see cync over async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h38m35s)

[right so there is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h38m42s)

[it yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h38m51s)

[going on here now I have to look now I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m28s)

[absolutely have to look um did they do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m30s)

[something incredibly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m33s)

[fancy value assertion builder like I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m37s)

[doing did they do something fancy with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m42s)

[this please tell me the answer is yes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m46s)

[because that would make me really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m48s)

[probably has it i'm looking for a very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h40m54s)

[asked me uh late last week](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m18s)

[actually of they were trying to figure](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m22s)

[out with reflection if a method was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m25s)

[async or not and it it was an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m27s)

[interesting question and I had to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m30s)

[eventually point out it's like you kind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m31s)

[of can but you kind of can't right like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m33s)

[the we do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m37s)

[uh let's see sharplab.io all right so if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m41s)

[we do this right and we look at this and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m44s)

[we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h41m46s)

[pass right so when you look so there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m12s)

[there's your state machine right but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m17s)

[when you look at this method the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m19s)

[compiler does technically put like this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m21s)

[attribute on here so you can kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m23s)

[look at it right and tell if this is an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m26s)

[async method right but is that any](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m28s)

[different than](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m31s)

[Uh why do you deleting all my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m33s)

[text stop doing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m37s)

[that right and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m39s)

[turn](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m44s)

[like every time I use the autolete](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m46s)

[it like the autocompletes blanking out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m55s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h42m58s)

[functionally both M and M2 are task](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m00s)

[returning methods right that do nothing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m03s)

[just to be clear these are these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m07s)

[effectively are do nothing methods right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m08s)

[and if I do uh public](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m11s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m15s)

[async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m19s)

[task](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m21s)

[who right I can inside of here await](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m25s)

[m this is getting really annoying await](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m31s)

[m2 right so I can await both of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m37s)

[because the return type from the method](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m41s)

[is awaitable and it doesn't even need to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m44s)

[be a task right so async and await is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m46s)

[implemented with duct typing so as long](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m49s)

[as the return type is awaitable you can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m52s)

[put the await keyword in front of it it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m55s)

[doesn't have to be a task or a value](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m57s)

[task or any of that stuff it has to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h43m59s)

[something that returns a and I'm going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m01s)

[to see if I can get this right uh a get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m04s)

[a waiter method and the return type from](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m07s)

[the get awaiter has to have something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m10s)

[with signatures that match the I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m12s)

[awaitable interface it doesn't have to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m14s)

[implement the interface but it has to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m15s)

[have those same members and I'd have to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m17s)

[double check what they are and more](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m18s)

[importantly those can be implemented](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m21s)

[with extension methods so you can take a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m23s)

[type that isn't in your assembly and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m25s)

[make it awaitable right there are there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m27s)

[are people who have done wacky things](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m29s)

[where you can do something like await](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m32s)

[42 and with an extension method you can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m35s)

[make int awaitable and then make this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m37s)

[you know sleep for 42 milliseconds or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m40s)

[something right don't do that that's bad](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m42s)

[that's that's that that's yucky right no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m44s)

[one expects this code to work right but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m47s)

[with the right extension method it can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m50s)

[it absolutely can but this is where uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m52s)

[it was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m55s)

[like when you say is it an async method](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m56s)

[you really don't know if it's async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h44m59s)

[especially if the question is because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m03s)

[usually when somebody says hey I want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m05s)

[know if something's an async method what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m07s)

[they're really asking is is the is this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m09s)

[method returning something I can await](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m12s)

[on or not that's usually subtly the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m14s)

[question and the answer is is it a async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m17s)

[method is you can kind of look at this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m20s)

[hidden attribute and go yeah it had the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m22s)

[async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m25s)

[keyword right and if that's what you're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m26s)

[looking for probably good](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m28s)

[enough however if what you're really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m31s)

[asking is is this thing awaitable that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m34s)

[a much more difficult question to answer](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m37s)

[because things can be awaitable via](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m40s)

[extension methods and unfortunately at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m42s)

[runtime you can't easily do the same](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m45s)

[lookup that the com that happened at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m48s)

[compile time because the compiler has](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m51s)

[the whole um syntax tree available to it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m53s)

[to know which extension methods to look](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m56s)

[up which are included which name spaces](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h45m59s)

[it should look at like you can certainly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m01s)

[rip through an assembly and say are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m03s)

[there any extension methods that match](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m04s)

[this but you've lost the ability to know](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m06s)

[which ones the compiler might have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m09s)

[considered and brought in and so it it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m11s)

[gets it gets to be a real gray area of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m14s)

[of trying to do it so it's like can you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m16s)

[do it kind of you can get close and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m18s)

[depending on how much you can constrain](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m22s)

[your use case it's close might be good](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m24s)

[enough right if you but if you want a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m26s)

[full generalized thing that exactly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m28s)

[matches what happened at compile time I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m30s)

[would not want to be the guy writing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m33s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m34s)

[so I might have to clip this and send](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m39s)

[this to my colleague um that's a nice](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m41s)

[explanation but that's what I was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m45s)

[looking for on this assertion builder is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m47s)

[this thing's clearly awaitable so I am](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m50s)

[looking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m53s)

[for whatever thing and maybe I'm looking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m54s)

[in the wrong place maybe I should look](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m57s)

[here because it's the return from](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h46m59s)

[here that's actually awaitable](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m03s)

[right so this guy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m07s)

[here vocable value assertion](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m10s)

[builder something in here has to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m14s)

[awaitable there it is get a waiter there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m17s)

[it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m20s)

[is and then it's just using the task a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m22s)

[waiter this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m26s)

[is beautifully](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m28s)

[clever beautifully clever](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m32s)

[process assertions async that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m41s)

[interesting that is interesting this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m44s)

[very very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m47s)

[clever i do find it interesting that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m52s)

[that's how it's working though it it it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m55s)

[seems weird it seems weird it seems like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h47m58s)

[there's a slight amount of extra](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m00s)

[overhead that doesn't need to be there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m01s)

[if the entire system under test is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m03s)

[synchronous feels like there's overhead](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m07s)

[that doesn't need to be there but maybe](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m09s)

[maybe I need to benchmark it maybe](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m11s)

[that's what I need to do is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m13s)

[benchmark this thing over a very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m15s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m19s)

[test and see and see the difference](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m21s)

[right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m25s)

[like XUnit with Microsoft testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m27s)

[platform](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m30s)

[mtp versus T unit with MT see which see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m32s)

[which one over a simple like I think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m38s)

[their sample here is like just a simple](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m39s)

[ad method right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m42s)

[so check it and maybe the other question](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m44s)

[is does the performance matter that much](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m47s)

[some test suites get really big and it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m49s)

[rare I think in the the projects I work](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m52s)

[on the ones that have a decent number of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m56s)

[tests the vast majority of my tests are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h48m58s)

[already async ronous to begin with so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m00s)

[it's not going to make a difference in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m05s)

[regard it won't make a difference in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m07s)

[that regard because my tests already](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m09s)

[have the async keyword on there because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m11s)

[they're already doing something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m13s)

[asynchronous let's see and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m14s)

[conditions very simple assertion scopes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m17s)

[oh mwah mwah this is actually something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m19s)

[that so I was using um fluent assertions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m26s)

[for a long time before they changed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m30s)

[their licensing model and this was one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m31s)

[of the things that I loved about fluent](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m33s)

[assertions is the assertion scopes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m35s)

[because sometimes you really want to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m38s)

[able to go through and say I want to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m40s)

[all of these checks and I don't want the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m42s)

[assert to just stop at the first failure](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m45s)

[i wanted to evaluate them all and show](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m47s)

[me all the failures right because that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m49s)

[like in a lot of cases that's what you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m52s)

[want right now obviously you have to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m54s)

[intelligent about what you're doing here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m56s)

[but that's not that bad that the fact](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h49m57s)

[that that's built in is even better to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m00s)

[me or conditions great type](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m02s)

[checking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m10s)

[um oh so this is just strongly typed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m20s)

[assertions i don't know if](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m26s)

[this I'm curious how often this happens](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m29s)

[because most of the other testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m32s)

[libraries their assert equals](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m34s)

[method like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m36s)

[You could like assert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m41s)

[equals int one to string one wouldn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m43s)

[compile there anyway because most of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m47s)

[those are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m48s)

[generics and I don't think this gets](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m50s)

[around the the real case that bites me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m52s)

[is implicit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m54s)

[conversions right that that's the one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m56s)

[that bites me and I don't know that this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h50m58s)

[fixes that like it's interesting but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m00s)

[it's not that much](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m02s)

[um assert throws](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m07s)

[close](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m09s)

[okay this makes me happy this makes me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m12s)

[very happy this also makes me realize I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m15s)

[need to go update because I have a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m17s)

[generator to do argument null exceptions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m18s)

[on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m20s)

[constructors for no other reason other](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m23s)

[than um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m25s)

[uh some people require code coverage](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m31s)

[metrics and so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m33s)

[it's they are worthless tests to write](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m35s)

[but if you are being docked code](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m37s)

[coverage points because you didn't write](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m39s)

[them which I think is dumb um my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m41s)

[solution was just source generator my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m44s)

[way to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m45s)

[victory so I can't avoid people's rules](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m46s)

[but I can make it so that I don't have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m50s)

[to type that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m51s)

[much so let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m57s)

[see oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h51m59s)

[yeah yeah that doesn't surprise me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m02s)

[instead you want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m09s)

[to Oh interesting yeah because right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m12s)

[like this this is definitely written in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m15s)

[a way to try to be confusing as it looks](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m17s)

[like C and D with the or in the middle](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m19s)

[but I I totally get how it would end up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m24s)

[here so what is the solution here right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m30s)

[so assertion group for value with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m32s)

[assertion assert okay so I kind of wish](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m37s)

[this and was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m40s)

[indented or maybe it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m41s)

[not oh I see so an assertion group lets](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m45s)

[you build up the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m49s)

[assertions got](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m51s)

[it i wonder why the with assertion](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m56s)

[method is required probably because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h52m58s)

[without it you'd have to just go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m00s)

[straight into](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m02s)

[something and then you do the ore](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m03s)

[afterwards](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m08s)

[yeah this is one of those situations](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m10s)

[where I do question if I would use this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m13s)

[or if because this is a lot of typing i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m16s)

[feel like what I'm more likely to do is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m20s)

[to declare some local](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m22s)

[variables and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m25s)

[just then do my assert on those local](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m27s)

[variables because then I can literally](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m32s)

[make my logic look like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m34s)

[this feels better](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m42s)

[um great built-in stuff for all the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m44s)

[stuff extensibility custom assertions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m48s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m53s)

[yes oh that's interesting so the async](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h53m59s)

[state machine gives you kind of a way of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m03s)

[getting in the middle oh wait this is a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m07s)

[different get result never](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m10s)

[mind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m16s)

[oh interesting okay multiple classes you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m18s)

[can hear from](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m22s)

[simplified the one thing I don't see in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m26s)

[here that I would love if it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m29s)

[had was deep object comparison](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m31s)

[that's the one thing I don't see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m39s)

[here let's see code coverage metrics ERX](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m42s)

[reports crash dumps hang](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m46s)

[dumps](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m49s)

[great and I assume these are all the new](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m52s)

[testing platform stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m55s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h54m58s)

[great that is exactly what we want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m00s)

[um that's the only thing I don't see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m05s)

[especially on the assertions that I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m07s)

[would love is fluent assertions gives](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m09s)

[you a very nice way of object](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m11s)

[comparison which you can get in other](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m16s)

[ways like you don't have to bring in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m19s)

[that library to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m20s)

[it but it would be very nice if it was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m22s)

[there unless I missed it it's just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m28s)

[not not part of the the thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m32s)

[yet wonder if it's I want out there on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m36s)

[the Nougat](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m39s)

[or I want the GitHub wonder if there is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m41s)

[an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m45s)

[issue only 12 open issues so this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h55m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m03s)

[interesting yeah and this is probably a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m10s)

[weird](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m13s)

[conflict yeah uh Banatron that that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m16s)

[previously was my Oh Fluent Extortions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m19s)

[yeah yeah for people who are unaware](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m22s)

[Fluent Assertions changed their](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m25s)

[licensing model i don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m27s)

[know two months ago it um did not score](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m31s)

[them any brownie points put it that way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m35s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m38s)

[it like it's technically something that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m39s)

[an open it's always a risk when you take](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m43s)

[on a any dependency that you aren't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m45s)

[paying for is that at some point they](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m47s)

[will go through and try and do it but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m49s)

[effectively people have tried to figure](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m51s)

[out how to make how to make open](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m53s)

[software or open source software](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m55s)

[profitable and it it's not an easy thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h56m57s)

[to do right um like the mock library had](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m00s)

[their fiasco](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m04s)

[um assertions isn't even the first one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m06s)

[to go through and change their licensing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m10s)

[model like that um to do that kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m11s)

[thing like all I did when Fluent](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m15s)

[Assertions changed their um their thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m17s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m20s)

[assertions let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m25s)

[see did somebody just fork](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m27s)

[them](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m30s)

[yeah yep that's that's pretty much what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m33s)

[happens right so yeah this is a very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m36s)

[good summary it 7X was licensed under](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m39s)

[Apache 2.0 licensing change to include](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m42s)

[potential fees for developers](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m45s)

[specifically around effectively their](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m46s)

[license came to if you're using me at a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m49s)

[big company uh and you're making stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m51s)

[that's worth a lot of money we we expect](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m53s)

[be paid uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m56s)

[which it's one of those things that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h57m59s)

[like yuck that's that's not a a good](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m01s)

[it's not a good feeling](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m06s)

[and as long as this stays maintained](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m08s)

[this might be an easy an easy change to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m11s)

[go through and do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m14s)

[um yeah we'll never change the license](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m18s)

[and again it's one of those it's like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m21s)

[that's great but there is a question of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m22s)

[how long like will that ever change like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m26s)

[I given that they explicitly took a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m29s)

[stance that they're never going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m31s)

[change the license I think it's pretty](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m32s)

[safe i think the bigger risk is that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m34s)

[somebody stops maintaining it like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m36s)

[that's that's the one of the other big](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m38s)

[risks with open source stuff like for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m40s)

[our um for our Velopac](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m42s)

[stuff I haven't plugged it this hour](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m46s)

[might as well plug it again right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m49s)

[like this is an open- source project but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m51s)

[we have grand aspirations of actually](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m55s)

[turning this into something that that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m57s)

[mildly profitable but we aren't going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h58m59s)

[do it by making by changing the license](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m01s)

[on the the core library or the SDK or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m04s)

[any of that stuff because that's kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m06s)

[a a jerk move like what we're doing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m08s)

[instead is we're saying okay this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m11s)

[this is an installer updater framework](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m14s)

[great right like that is going to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m16s)

[free open- source going to be continued](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m18s)

[to be maintained updated all the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m20s)

[goodness right that like if you are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m22s)

[looking for a way to deploy your your](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m25s)

[thick client applications I would hope](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m28s)

[that this would be the first thing you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m31s)

[look at right that's that's the intent](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m32s)

[um but if it's like hey I don't want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m35s)

[deal with figuring out how to host the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m38s)

[installer once I've built it right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m40s)

[that's where we're like hey we can build](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m43s)

[a nice SAS hosting platform and if you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m44s)

[want to host stuff yourself great right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m47s)

[the SDK will get you up and going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m49s)

[but for example distributing you'll know](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m53s)

[our our distributing docs are a little](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m56s)

[light we need to fix this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=01h59m57s)

[right but if you want to build it and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m00s)

[you want to say host your your stuff out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m03s)

[on an S3 bucket somewhere right this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m04s)

[will work](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m08s)

[and as as far as Velopac 3 is concerned](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m10s)

[not ours right we we are the local tool](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m22s)

[and SDK we will get you going but once](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m25s)

[people who want kind of an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m31s)

[we're looking to to build things out for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m34s)

[that way it's like hey if you want extra](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m37s)

[stuff right and there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m40s)

[features that we can offer on our](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m42s)

[backend server you can do more right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m45s)

[like I can build stuff that runs on my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m48s)

[value ad and where we can charge for so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m54s)

[that's that's kind of that's our our](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h00m57s)

[thinking right is it's we don't want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m00s)

[change an open source thing that people](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m02s)

[build and depend on like that's just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m04s)

[ducky it It doesn't make you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m08s)

[friends yeah you can also lock down](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m11s)

[Nougat versions in your project](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m13s)

[files uh yes I actually went a step](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m15s)

[further and I even went to my dependabot](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m19s)

[configs and marked my fluent assertions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m21s)

[down on 7x at least at least for my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m24s)

[projects that were using it is I just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m27s)

[pinned I pinned it on 7x and said](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m29s)

[dependabot do not bump this sucker again](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m31s)

[leave it as is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m34s)

[until I have time to to figure out what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m36s)

[I'm going to do with it right log an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m38s)

[issue pinned it on over because I have](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m41s)

[no major reason to jump to to 8X right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m43s)

[now anyway like what I have is working](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m45s)

[fine going to try to not add I'm trying](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m49s)

[to not spread it out but at some point](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m52s)

[I'm going to go back and and move it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m54s)

[around and honestly that awesome](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m55s)

[assertions may be it may be the path of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h01m57s)

[least resistance especially if this is a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m00s)

[7x fork it means it'll be a drop in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m02s)

[replacement](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m06s)

[right and it's already it's already](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m08s)

[using a renovate config to go through](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m11s)

[and change](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m14s)

[it which is awesome like that's that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m15s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m20s)

[cool because Velopac is actually using](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m21s)

[renovate in instead of dependabot in a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m25s)

[lot of its cases to be able to do the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m28s)

[updates which makes this kind of nice](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m39s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m46s)

[yeah cool i like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m48s)

[this thank you uh that's another repo](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m51s)

[that needs a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m53s)

[star so cool well I think then in terms](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m55s)

[of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h02m58s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m01s)

[let's let's take a quick gander at doing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m03s)

[the update here then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m06s)

[because that was really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m08s)

[nice i kind of think I I kind of think I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m12s)

[love it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m14s)

[kind of think I love it okay we're going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m17s)

[to give it another run and see see how](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m19s)

[well those those things work for doing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m22s)

[the migration okay so back this sucker](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m25s)

[up we're going to do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m28s)

[the the item group removing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m32s)

[bits right so we come in here we come in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m35s)

[here we do the the item group removal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m38s)

[just to make that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m43s)

[fit nicely know if that makes a big](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m47s)

[difference um so we'll put that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m49s)

[in and then I wonder what the assertion](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m54s)

[extensions adds](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h03m57s)

[in oh maybe maybe there is more in there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m00s)

[that I'm unaware of i guess we didn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m03s)

[really leverage all these sorry](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m05s)

[distractions okay uh re uh we need to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m07s)

[add the tunit reference into the nougat](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m10s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m13s)

[so that is here put you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m15s)

[in and then because this also gets](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m20s)

[around the issue of xunit v3](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m24s)

[and needing to drop net six though I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m27s)

[don't think net 6 was actually running](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m31s)

[so it may just be silently ignoring it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m34s)

[for the moment that gets me to there and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m37s)

[then I come back here and I do this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m40s)

[uh let's see so we are doing the UI test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m44s)

[one and then I just want to run these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m47s)

[suckers in order and I am going to close](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m50s)

[Visual Studio because I know something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m52s)

[about how this net format works and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m55s)

[know that Visual Studio tries to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h04m59s)

[helpful and I would like it to shut up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m00s)

[for a few](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m02s)

[minutes because if I can get this thing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m07s)

[to do a decent chunk of my updates for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m09s)

[Okay it's real thinking hard i'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m20s)

[wondering if it's going to get confused](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m24s)

[because of my ZAML test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m25s)

[framework very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m29s)

[possible very possible because my ZAML](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m31s)

[test framework does some wacky stuff but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m33s)

[the next one while it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m43s)

[thinking this does look so nice so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m50s)

[absolutely](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h05m54s)

[nice come on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m01s)

[the speed of this update does leave a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m05s)

[little bit to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m08s)

[desired go go go go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m15s)

[go thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m20s)

[thinking grab the next one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m23s)

[and if this is all it takes to migrate](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m32s)

[XUnit sorry XUnit you may be getting](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m36s)

[replaced okay so let's go back in that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m40s)

[the wrong that's the wrong](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m43s)

[solution got to move some stuff around](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m53s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h06m55s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m00s)

[okay so back to here now we remove](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m02s)

[this we remove xUnit we remove the xunit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m08s)

[include and then we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m14s)

[compile we chase the compile errors](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m17s)

[whatever is left i'm guessing it just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m20s)

[revved a whole bunch of stuff for me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m22s)

[touched a lot of files](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m25s)

[i mean it did a lot of find replaces for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m28s)

[I do not understand why it seems to get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m30s)

[so confused and not like does it only](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m33s)

[ever do the the first two in a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m36s)

[file i know I've got ones with more than](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m42s)

[two tests in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m45s)

[it it's like it only does two and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m46s)

[stops](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m49s)

[there is a bug in one of those analyzers](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m55s)

[that stops after](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h07m58s)

[two that's very consistent is it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h08m00s)

[replaces the first two test attributes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h08m03s)

[and then nothing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h08m06s)

[else okay so this one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h08m08s)

[here this is an interesting one to begin](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h08m13s)

[writer interesting let's take a look i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m23s)

[don't know that I would assume that it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m26s)

[lets](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m27s)

[one bleed into the other is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m29s)

[the current](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m35s)

[one output writer there we go look at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m38s)

[that hey Blade welcome back glad it was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m45s)

[a safe drive um okay so in this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m48s)

[case we don't need this means we don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m52s)

[need this which means I don't need the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m55s)

[constructor all that goes away the only](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h13m58s)

[reason we were passing this in is to get](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m01s)

[this test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m03s)

[output but I don't think we need this at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m04s)

[all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m07s)

[either because now we have direct access](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m09s)

[to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m11s)

[it right and so this really just ends up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m13s)

[becoming a wrapper around](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m17s)

[this then we just do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m21s)

[this safe is a strong word](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m25s)

[alive is more fitting well that's that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m31s)

[good i uh ride motorcycles myself and I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m35s)

[can assure you that some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m38s)

[days a live is a very accurate one uh so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m40s)

[let's see throw new valid operation](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m44s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m47s)

[uh could not find output](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m49s)

[writer i don't think we're ever going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m53s)

[hit this case because the usages of this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m55s)

[should always be in the context](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h14m58s)

[uh of a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m01s)

[test so this should be fine and then I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m04s)

[async lifetime there was docs on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m07s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m13s)

[um oh I built this car and to this day I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m20s)

[still haven't opened it all the way up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m23s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m24s)

[man I guess that does make it much more](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m26s)

[of an](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m29s)

[adventure uh I async lifetime on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m30s)

[injected data becomes I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m33s)

[asynciator i async lifetime on a test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m35s)

[becomes a method attribute with before](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m38s)

[test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m41s)

[okay so this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m42s)

[is I I am assuming this is going to work](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m44s)

[uh because that becomes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m49s)

[this and I assume this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m52s)

[becomes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m55s)

[after test what is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h15m57s)

[the what is test in this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m01s)

[case oh it's a hook type oh got it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m03s)

[that's clever oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m08s)

[shoot i actually want this to be class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m16s)

[not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m17s)

[test oh this okay oh okay we're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m22s)

[uh think cars police car outside quad](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m28s)

[turbo or GT](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m32s)

[inside okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m36s)

[nice i I'm seeing a a major](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m45s)

[sleeper um what are you method must be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m49s)

[static oh do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m53s)

[I oh I do have to do this before test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h16m58s)

[don't I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m01s)

[oh but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m02s)

[how this may change the behavior then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m08s)

[slightly might have to think about](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m11s)

[this i guess this is in parody but it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m15s)

[nice that this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m18s)

[is the parts fit so I might have made a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m23s)

[scream metal death trap uh yes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m26s)

[uh let's see and then this is where we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m32s)

[want to disable parallelization so this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m35s)

[is this is what we saw up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m38s)

[above for parallel limiter yeah so we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m41s)

[want one of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m46s)

[these i want one of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m47s)

[and we want to just dial this sucker all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m51s)

[the way down to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m53s)

[uh let's see file](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h17m56s)

[uh single parallel limit limit one right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m01s)

[and then we want to grab](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m05s)

[uh I want to assembly level this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m09s)

[beast right and then we want this to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m14s)

[no parallel all the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m20s)

[time okay so that gets me down to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m24s)

[there okay and then inline data I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m27s)

[believe that was also in the migration](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m31s)

[doc if I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m33s)

[remember line data becomes arguments](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m38s)

[so this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m44s)

[becomes that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m46s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m49s)

[right uh why did I lose assembly that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m51s)

[just a system reflection](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h18m54s)

[call](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m00s)

[oh that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m02s)

[annoying so one of its global](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m04s)

[using is conflicting with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m07s)

[system.reflection with the assembly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m09s)

[class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m12s)

[m not sure how I feel about](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m17s)

[that dino turned](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m22s)

[out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m30s)

[nice uh assert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m33s)

[that and I guess this is also where we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m36s)

[end up awaiting right assert that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m39s)

[window get visible is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m42s)

[true right so in that regard I guess](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m45s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m49s)

[clean and we don't need this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m50s)

[anymore all right](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m53s)

[next uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h19m57s)

[here i think what we can do is just this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m01s)

[right replace in files matching current](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m05s)

[project replace all right just Oh there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m08s)

[were only two of them that That goes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m11s)

[away](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m13s)

[um that goes away that goes away just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m17s)

[nuke all of that clean that up and then](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m21s)

[assert true is going to be assert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m26s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m32s)

[true uh is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m35s)

[true then we're going to await both of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m38s)

[them after the erases](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m45s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m48s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m51s)

[true wait](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h20m57s)

[assert that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m00s)

[bananas oh I think you do these slightly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m03s)

[backwards then assert that suggestion](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m06s)

[box is equal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m08s)

[to because Yeah so ex](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m11s)

[So generally assertions you write](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m14s)

[expected actual in this case it's actual](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m16s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m22s)

[okay I I I guess I can get on board with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m24s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m26s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m28s)

[um that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m30s)

[uh is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m34s)

[through](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m43s)

[didn't file line what was the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m45s)

[uh I love that feature in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m51s)

[the multiple carrots yes that was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m53s)

[actually one of the things because I did](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m55s)

[um a bunch of stuff in VS Code before](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h21m58s)

[Visual Studio got it and oh my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m02s)

[word this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m04s)

[is this is gold um I do wish uh like it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m07s)

[is not nearly discoverable enough i felt](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m14s)

[like it was much easier um to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m17s)

[find and I often forget](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m21s)

[the the the keyboard commands when I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m25s)

[which one uh so I am I am running](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m28s)

[preview builds so one here so just keep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m31s)

[that in mind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m35s)

[as well so and full disclosure I'm a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m48s)

[Microsoft MVP so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m50s)

[uh uh so I end up I I end up getting a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m54s)

[free MSDN for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h22m59s)

[it which is convenient for stuff like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m03s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m07s)

[um I don't like this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m10s)

[um is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m18s)

[true exists or not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m22s)

[check i don't need this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m25s)

[anymore this is not necessary](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m29s)

[um that handles](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m36s)

[that that handles that color zone test](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m38s)

[combo box test and this is There's going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m42s)

[to be just a bunch of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m44s)

[these like this i like this a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m47s)

[lot oh I love that co-pilot figured out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m53s)

[that fact and test are only three](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m56s)

[letters](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h23m59s)

[apart oh you're an idiot sometimes go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h24m02s)

[pilot you are an utter idiot okay so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h24m04s)

[that'll clear that clear](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h24m08s)

[my OBS crops my taskbar off the bottom](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h24m46s)

[because I don't like like the big search](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h24m54s)

[ones before](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h25m37s)

[um yeah I think I think I've looked at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h25m42s)

[these a handful of times as well to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h25m45s)

[about once a year so I always go back to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h25m56s)

[a clean clean state because I do tend to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h25m58s)

[try stuff and it feels like spring](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m00s)

[why do you format your machine you don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m05s)

[need to do that i'm like it feels](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m07s)

[cleaner i don't have to like I collect](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m08s)

[stuff it's messy it's kind of nice to be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m11s)

[able to burn the house to the ground and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m14s)

[build a new house right like it is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m16s)

[annoying for about a weekend while I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m19s)

[while I run all my Windgit scripts and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m21s)

[whatnot and get everything reinstalled](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m23s)

[and you know then find all the things](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m25s)

[that I inevitably didn't have backed up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m27s)

[and have to go and recreate that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m29s)

[always a fun adventure but it also has](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m31s)

[forced me to make sure that anything of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m34s)

[value I have in one of my backup](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m35s)

[locations like I care about it it goes](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m38s)

[in the backup spots that way it's backed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m40s)

[up](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m43s)

[appropriately yeah like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m45s)

[It's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m48s)

[okay yeah I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m51s)

[guess that's that's not a ringing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m54s)

[endorsement is it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m56s)

[um okay that gets me to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h26m59s)

[there](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m04s)

[wait that selected index i don't know](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m11s)

[why I did it like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m14s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m15s)

[Note that selected](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m19s)

[index is greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m22s)

[what hold on what is selected index](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m29s)

[oh this is interesting because it's a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m37s)

[nullable int I don't have the greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m39s)

[than extension method that's interesting](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m42s)

[see I use Arch on uh everything except I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m48s)

[like my KD Plasma](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h27m57s)

[browser oh that's an interesting idea](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m05s)

[does the window stuff](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m11s)

[sync or are you or are you just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m13s)

[synchronizing that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m15s)

[yourself i could understand getting like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m21s)

[the the browser stuff syncing but how](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m23s)

[are you how are you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m25s)

[syncing anything i'm doing it myself ah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m29s)

[okay got it got it yeah because that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m31s)

[I've effectively done at least for some](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m34s)

[of my my apps and similar um effectively](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m38s)

[manually sync my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m42s)

[my all of my scripts and whatnot around](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m44s)

[that way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m46s)

[they they persist through my uh my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m47s)

[system](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m52s)

[wipes a docker container gotcha now that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m53s)

[makes sense](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h28m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m00s)

[and oh I don't know how to do the value](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m05s)

[on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m09s)

[it how would you how would you use](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m13s)

[this see and then I I I feel like what I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m24s)

[do is is then this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m27s)

[right is greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m32s)

[than right like I feel like that's what](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m36s)

[I'm going](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m39s)

[for i feel like I should be able to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m41s)

[combine these and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m47s)

[where not sure how I feel about this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m52s)

[combo box test i want to make sure I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m54s)

[didn't botch that 73 uh let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h29m56s)

[see box](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m01s)

[test greater than zero okay thought](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m06s)

[that's what I had thought that's what I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m09s)

[had written down i'm I'm now on the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m11s)

[fence](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m14s)

[uh I like the way this reads like I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m16s)

[realize it's slightly more verbose](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m19s)

[but doesn't feel that bad](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m23s)

[um and actually I guess I could do that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m31s)

[this because there's nothing stopping](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m37s)

[you from putting the expression in here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m39s)

[because because this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m40s)

[nullable right this leverages a lifted](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m43s)

[operator so like in the previous](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m45s)

[comparison with it needing to be true](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m49s)

[maybe I should do that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m50s)

[right where we're doing this assert that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m55s)

[greater than or equal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h30m59s)

[to zero](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m01s)

[uh is true right so because this is a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m04s)

[lifted operator on a nullable int the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m07s)

[only way this can be be true is if this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m10s)

[is not null and the value is greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m12s)

[than zero so it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m14s)

[it's effectively checking two conditions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m16s)

[of this nullable](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m19s)

[int one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m20s)

[shot that context](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m41s)

[because I think this is where you can](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m43s)

[put this message in right i think is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m45s)

[what I saw when I was reading it uh why](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m49s)

[the assertion is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m52s)

[needed phrase does not start with word](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m53s)

[because it is prepended](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h31m57s)

[automatically there's no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h32m03s)

[content okay I think that works](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h32m09s)

[uh that menu item](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h32m14s)

[go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h33m53s)

[uh that selected index line again i was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h33m56s)

[AFK oh sorry um let's see selected index](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h33m59s)

[on 73 yeah so it's this idea here of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m03s)

[because selected index is a nullable int](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m08s)

[i don't see an easy way with the way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m11s)

[these assertions are set up to be able](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m13s)

[to go something like assert that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m15s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m18s)

[index because ideally what I want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m20s)

[type is here is is greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m22s)

[uh than zero like this is the this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m25s)

[the code that I want to write the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m27s)

[problem is is the is greater than is um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m30s)

[declared on I think it's i number or one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m34s)

[of the numeric and nullable int is not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m37s)

[that but you can do uh inequality](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m41s)

[operators against nullables because the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m44s)

[compiler will lift the operator when not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m47s)

[null and apply it to the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m50s)

[value problem is the compiler lifting](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m52s)

[the operator isn't something that lends](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m54s)

[itself well to method overload so I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m56s)

[think in this case this is the simplest](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h34m59s)

[or we have to do the composite and on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m01s)

[the assertion I I think are the only two](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m04s)

[choices that I see so that that doesn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m06s)

[make me feel](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m09s)

[great this goes down to I think](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m10s)

[argument fence](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m15s)

[there that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m18s)

[uh okay is in range i'm going to do this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m21s)

[one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m24s)

[above](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m27s)

[that yeah and so the the problem I the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m35s)

[problem I ran into with doing that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m39s)

[approach is when you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m41s)

[do which again would be would be great](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m44s)

[right is if I could do assert uh is not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m47s)

[null](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m51s)

[and the the problem is is because this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m54s)

[is strongly typed all the way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m56s)

[through after this and I'm still acting](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h35m58s)

[on a nullable int not an int like and](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m01s)

[that's what that's kind of what I really](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m04s)

[want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m06s)

[is the ability](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m07s)

[to have an overload that goes through i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m11s)

[may end up actually writing an extension](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m14s)

[method uh against this that does the is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m17s)

[greater than um on the nullable type i](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m21s)

[it feels like something I might want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m24s)

[end up building heck it might be](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m26s)

[something I end up just pull requesting](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m28s)

[back into the library um I might have to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m30s)

[see what the signature ends up looking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m32s)

[because that feels like something that I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m35s)

[want to be able to do is is to have that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m36s)

[sort of situation and have it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m41s)

[work uh let's see so uh assert that uh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m44s)

[is between oh look at that look at that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m50s)

[lower](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m53s)

[bound oh wait hold on what What is this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m54s)

[saying because this is is in range](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h36m57s)

[oh so this isn't is between it's is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m03s)

[close to is effectively what I I would](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m06s)

[equate it to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m09s)

[uh is there and is close](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m13s)

[to negative is not between is greater](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m20s)

[than or equal is not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m22s)

[positive zero satisfies](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m25s)

[Uh so this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m30s)

[is this isn't necessarily the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m32s)

[one so this one here is TUnit that I was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m35s)

[playing around with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m39s)

[um but it is so it is it is TUNIT with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m44s)

[the the Microsoft uh testing platform](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m49s)

[which is what TUnit is built on top of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m51s)

[so it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m54s)

[not so some of its limit or limitations](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m56s)

[some of its structure is heavily driven](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h37m59s)

[by this new testing platform](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m02s)

[structure but like the assertion library](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m06s)

[on top of it at the end of the day you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m08s)

[can still mix any assertion library you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m11s)

[want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m14s)

[in which is how like fluent assertions](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m15s)

[and whatnot like they work with any](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m18s)

[testing frameworks look like well yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m20s)

[because testing assertions are if match](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m23s)

[good if not throw exception like that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m26s)

[that's all an assertion library does is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m29s)

[just throw so it's like you can kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m31s)

[mix and match assertion libraries as you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m34s)

[see fit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m37s)

[um okay because this was not quite the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m39s)

[same cuz this is really looking for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m49s)

[something that's plus or minus zero](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m52s)

[according to the tolerance what did I do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m54s)

[this up here um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h38m55s)

[uh it was X unit that's the assert is in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m03s)

[range](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m06s)

[this was using xunit v2v3 because we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m08s)

[upgraded to v3](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m11s)

[earlier so](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m16s)

[I in this case I actually can do is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m18s)

[between](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m23s)

[because I can do minus tolerance is the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m24s)

[lower bound because it's it's just zero](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m28s)

[and tolerance is the upper bound so in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m31s)

[this case is between](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m33s)

[works it's not going to work when zero](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m35s)

[isn't my first](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m38s)

[parameter but for now this will be just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m41s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m44s)

[um I can get away with this kind of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m46s)

[garbage yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h39m56s)

[case like I picked up an extra brace in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m00s)

[there somewhere you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m03s)

[collapse oh I already had the extra](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m06s)

[brace from above okay that handles those](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m08s)

[that handles those great great great](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m11s)

[great great great](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m13s)

[great and this becomes arguments](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m16s)

[there this is once again going to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m28s)

[beert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m32s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m36s)

[this right uh is yeah co-pilot](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m38s)

[uh let's see content host air](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m51s)

[view tolerance co-pilot you are a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m53s)

[freaking show off some days you are a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m56s)

[absolute](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h40m59s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m05s)

[um what we should do we should take This](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m07s)

[control F place and files](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m10s)

[argument current project replace all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m14s)

[done there that just saved me 178](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m18s)

[types uh let's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m22s)

[see and actually do that too let's do](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m24s)

[this everywhere where there's aert we're](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m29s)

[wait dot](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m33s)

[call there we go 508 of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m37s)

[them no way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m40s)

[oh I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m43s)

[just didn't think that went all the way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m47s)

[through not think that one all the way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m50s)

[through there there we](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m54s)

[go much better and actually we could](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h41m58s)

[change this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m02s)

[into I not doing this earlier i've got a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m04s)

[colleague that is a Reax](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m07s)

[wizard that I'm I'm sure would](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m10s)

[be immediately wanting to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m14s)

[uh Yeah yeah just replace the await](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m18s)

[await with just a wait yeah exactly um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m20s)

[technically you can make a wait a wait a](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m24s)

[wait a wait](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m26s)

[a there's there's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m28s)

[uh you can actually end up chaining](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m33s)

[multiple awaits together it's it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m36s)

[really ugly don't ever](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m39s)

[um uh assert](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m43s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m47s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m50s)

[is equal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m54s)

[to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h42m58s)

[go set up assert that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m00s)

[is equal to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m11s)

[that booyah done there is one more class](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m14s)

[down this will probably end up taking me](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m19s)

[a little while to upgrade all of them](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m22s)

[trying to decide how long until](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m24s)

[my caffeine gives out and I need to go](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m26s)

[sleep but I think Oh](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m31s)

[let's Let's fix all of these](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m36s)

[two might as well we do all of those](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m39s)

[pretty safely eight more of those should](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m42s)

[cut a bunch of airs out of the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m45s)

[mix](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m48s)

[um cut all of those ones](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m53s)

[out thought we already did this oh I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h43m57s)

[think we did it on the last one replace](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m00s)

[all these with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m02s)

[You know what is really ugly someone](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m08s)

[paid me to make their Python code](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m16s)

[multi-threaded](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m17s)

[yes i mean I I think the the key marker](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m23s)

[is that you got paid to do it that that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m27s)

[I think is the the key marker of all](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m30s)

[this okay so we we've got a lot of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m32s)

[member datas that we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m34s)

[adjust](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m35s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m37s)

[um yes co-pilot that's exactly what I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m42s)

[wanted yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m49s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m52s)

[yeah okay co-pilot I'm a little](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m55s)

[impressed keep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m57s)

[going yep](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h44m59s)

[yeah a C# dev](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m07s)

[primarily that's pretty good honestly](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m11s)

[like depending on how long a lazy one at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m13s)

[that no no no no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m15s)

[i I firmly believe that laziness is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m18s)

[actually the mark of a a good dev](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m22s)

[because oftentimes the lazy devs are the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m26s)

[ones that spend the time looking for](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m28s)

[those solutions that like automate their](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m31s)

[lives and make everybody on the team](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m33s)

[happier right it's like I don't want to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m36s)

[do that let's find some easier way to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m38s)

[make that happen right so laziness is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m40s)

[not always a bad thing taken to the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m42s)

[extreme it could be but a an appropriate](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m45s)

[amount of laziness is actually](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m48s)

[good uh that one we already did start at](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m54s)

[top go down](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m55s)

[through i once made a UI in Windforms in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h45m58s)

[VB by accident just wrote the code in VB](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m01s)

[rather than remaking the UI](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m05s)

[i actually my very first](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m07s)

[uh ex forte into programming was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m10s)

[uh actually doing VB.NET with](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m16s)

[Windforms it's what got me actually](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m21s)

[excited about coding so it's not that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m24s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m28s)

[it's not great but it's it's not that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m30s)

[bad man co-pilot's ability to do that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m33s)

[is shockingly good just burn down the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m38s)

[constructor you co-pilot I'm glad you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m43s)

[figured out how to do that replacement](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m45s)

[for still do windforms yeah the like](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m48s)

[Windforms is actually bigger in terms](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m52s)

[of well I think in almost every metric](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m56s)

[Windforms is bigger than WPF](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h46m59s)

[um like Windforms got to the market](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m03s)

[early they had a reasonable product that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m07s)

[didn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m10s)

[suck and just not kind of knocked it out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m11s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m15s)

[park](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m16s)

[uh society dog i like that yeah a lazy](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m20s)

[person does stuff uh to make life easier](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m24s)

[to be able to relax more and have more](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m27s)

[time for themsel a person that just](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m30s)

[lives in a mess is a slob right yes I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m32s)

[like that definition that one works that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h47m36s)

[the SDK and the installers and all of](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h57m53s)

[that stuff that that will be free open](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=02h57m55s)

[now can you figure out the what the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m08s)

[opposite of true is or even this true no](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m10s)

[is that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m13s)

[good no is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m15s)

[false not pay attention this is the one](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m18s)

[where we do assert that is true say they](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m21s)

[good job](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m25s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m39s)

[true](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m43s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m45s)

[false pattern yet no you still can't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m48s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m55s)

[true that is false there we go you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h05m58s)

[finally figured it out that took you way](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m01s)

[too long](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m03s)

[co-pilot you way too](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m05s)

[no no that is not](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m10s)

[correct about now can you figure it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m15s)

[out](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m18s)

[no okay](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m20s)

[uh let's see which tool are you using](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m31s)

[for testing oh good good question i hate](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m33s)

[sleeping so it is so two two key things](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m35s)

[to note](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m39s)

[uh that is the underlying one but TUnit](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m42s)

[is the new library that I am playing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m46s)

[with as a testing library but it is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m48s)

[built on the the Microsoft testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m51s)

[platform which is that MTP uh blog link](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m53s)

[there uh let's see currently working on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m57s)

[a discord bot people can install in](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h06m59s)

[docker technically run in vulcan but](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m01s)

[prefers](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m04s)

[uh rauda will transcribe text from each](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m06s)

[user in the call individually it uses](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m10s)

[deep speech and Discord audio syncs i'm](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m12s)

[thinking it'd be useful for streamers](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m15s)

[doing podcasts oh that is very very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m17s)

[interesting yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m25s)

[so specifically](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m30s)

[like selfishly I would want something](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m32s)

[like that to be able to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m35s)

[um Oh second link 404s oh yeah that's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m39s)

[probably because I grabbed](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m43s)

[the grab you a better](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m46s)

[one this is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m49s)

[the There's the link we actually want](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m51s)

[um selfishly that kind of bot sounds](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m55s)

[good to me only because being able to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h07m58s)

[transcribe with the separate](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m00s)

[speakers opens up a very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m04s)

[interesting options for some of the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m09s)

[automation that I want to do on my](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m11s)

[stream here because I uh will often](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m13s)

[bring in colleagues or friends who are](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m16s)

[interested in working on a project or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m19s)

[similar and we'll just pow-wow on it on](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m21s)

[something and and work on it together](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m23s)

[which works great because then it's it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m25s)

[not a stream of me just yakking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m27s)

[for a while it's uh it's actually you](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m29s)

[know going back and forth and there's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m32s)

[there's someone to riff on and that kind](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m34s)

[of thing um but it does make because](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m35s)

[right now all I do is grab the YouTube](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m39s)

[subtitle generation which like yeah](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m41s)

[throw speaker out the window you don't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m44s)

[get that kind of data and so it makes it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m45s)

[um much more](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m48s)

[difficult so having something of that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m51s)

[nature would be useful honestly it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m53s)

[it's something that's that I would even](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m56s)

[find use usefulness in even if it wasn't](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h08m58s)

[live and it was just feeding in the](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m02s)

[recording or](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m03s)

[similar that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m05s)

[x is equal to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m08s)

[one i will say if you uh the question](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m12s)

[too about what am I using for testing](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m15s)

[there is this bit of test up here that](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m17s)

[is definitely not normal](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m20s)

[um but that is that is using this](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m24s)

[library that is effectively mine um it](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m29s)

[is a UI testing library spec and it was](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m34s)

[built specifically to test the UI](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m37s)

[components of this material design](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m40s)

[library so it's not really a general](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m41s)

[purpose UI testing library it's very](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m43s)

[much built for testing WPF theme](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m46s)

[libraries which is](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m50s)

[like there's not a lot of those so it's](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m52s)

[it's a very niche thing uh just have to](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h09m55s)

[log time stamps and the user speaking](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h10m00s)

[and that would give you free subtitles](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h10m02s)

[yeah and honestly at one point in time I](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h10m04s)

[ran my own subtitles on the stream um](https://youtu.be/4fVR_Jiuj_I?t=03h10m07s)
