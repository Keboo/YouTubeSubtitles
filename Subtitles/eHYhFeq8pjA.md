[hour and we will get going](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m03s)



[welcome I just want to thank everyone](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m05s)



[for coming and dropping in again so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m07s)



[tonight my current plan unless I get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m10s)



[distracted is to pick up where I left](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m14s)



[off last time and go through and finish](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m15s)



[up the the MA apps integration so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m20s)



[previously we had started down this path](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m23s)



[of for the three oh release in material](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m26s)



[design in zamel the the my apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m29s)



[integration was broken and the short](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m33s)



[version is ma apps is upgrading to 2.0](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m35s)



[it is currently a work in progress it is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m40s)



[not released yet there are preview](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m42s)



[nougat packages out there but as part of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m44s)



[doing that they've standardized on a lot](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m46s)



[of new ways of actually managing the the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m50s)



[brush names and their theme resources so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m56s)



[if anyone's interested in what we did](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h00m59s)



[last time there is the the stream from](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m01s)



[last time](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m06s)



[alternatively if anybody is interested](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m07s)



[in it you can always find recordings in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m09s)



[my stream if I can type my own URL](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m13s)



[correctly there you go so basically Kido](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m16s)



[kibou comm is my domain and I've just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m20s)



[done subdomains on any platform that I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m23s)



[on so if you're looking for me platform](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m27s)



[named keen Okubo comm if I'm on there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m29s)



[you'll find it so that's that's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m31s)



[basically where that is at so my plan is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m33s)



[to go through and finish it out as I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m37s)



[recall from last time we got fairly far](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m40s)



[down the path of implementing my apps it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m43s)



[was just there was some crashes in the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m47s)



[demo app and it looked like somebody had](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m48s)



[thrown some comments on my draft pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m52s)



[request indicating what the problem](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m55s)



[might be so let's drop over there and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h01m57s)



[take a look real quick if I can switch](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m01s)



[my camera mode there we go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m03s)



[okay so this is the pull request 1483](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m06s)



[that we had started on last time and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m10s)



[again if anybody has questions I'm happy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m12s)



[to deviate from my predefined idea of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m13s)



[what I think I'm going to do and do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m17s)



[something else but I figured it so so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m18s)



[yeah so this is where I'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m25s)



[unless somebody has questions or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m27s)



[examples or whatnot that they want to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m28s)



[see because I am always happy to jump in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m30s)



[and help people with projects that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m31s)



[they're working on otherwise I'm just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m33s)



[gonna carry on my merry way](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m35s)



[and keep working on trying to get this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m37s)



[release done so we implemented my apps a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m39s)



[whole bunch of stuff with brushes and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m43s)



[theming and fun regex to go through and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m44s)



[auto code out a lot of it for us and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m47s)



[then this oh boy I'm a medium ma Wow I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m50s)



[probably butchered that and I'm sorry](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m55s)



[went through and commented that it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h02m57s)



[looked like some of the base styles that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m00s)



[we were using have had their keys](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m03s)



[changed from my apps metro-style slider](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m06s)



[thumb to my op styles thumb slider so a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m09s)



[couple couple things here that they've](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m13s)



[cleaned up looks like a lot of dropping](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m16s)



[of the the the dot metro portion of this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m18s)



[so if we clean these guys up hopefully](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m21s)



[this thing starts working I think we are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m25s)



[pretty close so let me grab my code](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m27s)



[because I am still in the same state as](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m33s)



[where we left off from before and I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m35s)



[think we're gonna go here make](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m40s)



[everything a little bit bigger so for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m42s)



[anybody on a smaller screen hopefully](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m44s)



[that's nice and viewable and again if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m47s)



[people have questions or confused or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m51s)



[lost feel free to just stop me and ask](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m53s)



[questions and I'm happy to go back and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m56s)



[explain stuff so for my apps they](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h03m57s)



[brought in basically all of these theme](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m01s)



[brushes and so we went through and we we](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m04s)



[converted from our built-in theme object](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m07s)



[which just contains basically a long](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m10s)



[list of colors](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m12s)



[there's not a lot else in material](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m14s)



[design there's not really a concept of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m17s)



[light gradient brushes and so it kind of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m19s)



[makes our life a little bit easier in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m21s)



[that we can just pass a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m23s)



[colors around which is all that we we](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m25s)



[have here for our theme there are a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m28s)



[couple couple properties we're not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m30s)



[really dealing with right now namely](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m32s)



[theme name display name and color scheme](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m34s)



[we're just setting them to an empty](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m36s)



[string so that they work I'm not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m38s)



[entirely sure what the appropriate](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m40s)



[values are to put here anyway so I'm not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m44s)



[handling them but mostly we just want to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m48s)



[get this working so we have this demo](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m51s)



[app here and let's just fire this up and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m54s)



[we'll walk through it real quick that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m57s)



[goes through and actually shows the MA](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h04m58s)



[apps and dragonballs integration so for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m04s)



[those people who haven't heard the term](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m06s)



[dragonballs before it is another library](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m07s)



[by the same author who initially started](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m10s)



[the material design and zamel project it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m13s)



[basically brings a nice material design](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m15s)



[themed tab control in but it as the name](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m19s)



[implies you can drag the tabs around](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m22s)



[undock them redock them all that all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m24s)



[that kind of fancy stuff that you would](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m26s)



[that you would want to do with tabs so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m28s)



[that's what that library is and so if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m30s)



[you want to work with it it is there but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m35s)



[more importantly we want to make sure my](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m39s)



[apps works because my apps is insanely](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m41s)



[popular and we want to try and get that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m44s)



[going so compile compile compile go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m49s)



[computer go I believe in you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m52s)



[come on visual studio I know it's been](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m54s)



[so long since you've had to compile](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m56s)



[something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m58s)



[just launched I was switching branches](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h05m59s)



[earlier so it probably had to do a full](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m02s)



[recompile of everything as I probably](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m04s)



[confused it with all of my with all of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m11s)



[my changing but let's let's go through](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m15s)



[here so so this is this is all of the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m20s)



[the wonderful stuff there this is the MA](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m22s)



[apps and so we noticed the the list box](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m26s)



[works great the buttons were great I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m28s)



[going to note that that button is wrong](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m30s)



[so we probably have an issue there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m32s)



[numeric up-down that's not quite right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m34s)



[something's off there datagrid no this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m37s)



[one actually this one's styled out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m43s)



[basically the way I would expect so it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m45s)



[not really the MA apps data grid but I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m49s)



[think that's okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m51s)



[I think that's desirable so we've got](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m52s)



[some issues on the numeric up-down](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m55s)



[control I'm pretty sure if I click](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m57s)



[sliders this is where that other crash](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h06m59s)



[occurs yeah so static resource holder](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m01s)



[cannot find resources style horizontal](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m07s)



[track and we've got all all kinds of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m09s)



[stuff in here so I think this is related](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m13s)



[to where that comment was on all on all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m15s)



[the stuff that I did wrong](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m21s)



[okay so we've got a tab control tab](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m25s)



[items sliders and I think this is this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m30s)



[guy here because this guy basically just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m35s)



[has two sliders so slider an arranged](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m38s)



[slider I've never understood why people](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m40s)



[do this in general when you're declaring](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m45s)



[your styles you usually want your styles](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m48s)



[with a static resource in WPF so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m51s)



[basically there's two resource resolved](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m54s)



[or markup extensions that you can use](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m57s)



[static resource and dynamic resource and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h07m59s)



[basically the two use cases for them are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m02s)



[static resource everywhere and dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m04s)



[resource only when there's a chance that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m08s)



[that resource is actually going to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m10s)



[change at runtime so things like brushes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m11s)



[or colors if you're letting the user](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m14s)



[toggle between like dark and light theme](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m16s)



[for example you might use a dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m17s)



[resource so that that automatically](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m20s)



[updates your Styles unless you're doing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m21s)



[something to automatically like swap](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m24s)



[that style at runtime or do something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m26s)



[magical with it you don't want to do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m27s)



[this you basically just want to use a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m30s)



[static resource to go through and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m36s)



[resolve it because the static resource](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m37s)



[is going to be a lot more performant](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m39s)



[because it looks it up once and it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m40s)



[done it doesn't do all of the change](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m42s)



[notification stuff okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m45s)



[through here to do and let's take a look](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m49s)



[at these sliders so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m51s)



[down in the MA apps theme ma apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m52s)



[library going to be buried in themes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h08m58s)



[range slider okay so I think if I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m01s)



[understood all of the comments correctly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m06s)



[this needs to go away](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m08s)



[nope nope this needs to go away](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m13s)



[drop the metro and we can go and pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m17s)



[this style dictionary real quick and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m20s)



[just validate that room let's see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m23s)



[github my ops let's just go look at it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m26s)



[real quick it's probably the easiest way](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m29s)



[to do it and just validate that we get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m32s)



[all of these keys right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m35s)



[we could always go through and sort of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m36s)



[guess and check our way through it but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m39s)



[I'm not real interested in guessing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m41s)



[check prefer to just look it up and be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m44s)



[beyond the right path the first time so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m48s)



[let's see here so my apps metro](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h09m51s)

[want to make sure I didn't break this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m31s)



[somewhere else](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m32s)



[along the way something in the back of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m33s)



[my head is telling me that the key for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m34s)



[the thumb has changed control template](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m36s)



[nope right there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m40s)



[there is one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m44s)



[slider I'm just blind okay cool great](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m46s)



[so we're swapping out theirs and once](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m51s)



[again](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m55s)



[trying to decide if dynamic resource is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h11m59s)



[what we want here because the dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m01s)



[resource does let somebody else](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m04s)



[theoretically inject something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m06s)



[no I don't think we want to do this if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m12s)



[somebody wants to use if somebody wants](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m14s)



[to put in a different template here they](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m17s)



[can override this style its itself](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m20s)



[there's nothing there's nothing magical](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m22s)



[about this they can just override this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m25s)



[whole thing okay so there's there are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m27s)



[these and let's see let's hunt this one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m32s)



[down inside of my apps make sure we get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m36s)



[this guy right horizontal middle thumb](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m38s)



[so was there a comment about horizontal](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m42s)



[middle thumb with styles Metro thumb](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m44s)



[range slider okay so this is probably](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m51s)



[back up a directory controls range](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m55s)



[slider](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h12m58s)



[No](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m03s)



[you know it's got to be in a different](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m10s)



[different resource dictionary this guy's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m12s)



[not coming up with anything so do two](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m14s)



[doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m17s)



[where are you where are you so let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m18s)



[just grab let's grab this key here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m24s)



[slider um some cider okay so these keys](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m29s)



[are correct okay I'm just gonna trust](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m33s)



[him for now let's see here so this guy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m35s)



[gets swapped out for this one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m40s)



[and then we need horizontal track which](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m47s)



[I believe was the initial problem so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m50s)



[let's see my apps this guy here gets](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h13m55s)



[swapped out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m00s)



[great let's try and see what happens](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m06s)



[this should hopefully get us close](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m09s)



[I'm really hoping this Lancet close to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m15s)



[working it'll be nice to have this done](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m20s)



[so that people can play with it for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m23s)



[reference if anybody watching is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m27s)



[actually using the 3.0 preview packages](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m29s)



[for material design I know I've seen](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m37s)



[some people log issues but I also](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m41s)



[appreciate it if people let me know that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m43s)



[they're using it and things are working](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m45s)



[I'm used to the idea of when things are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m47s)



[broke and I I assume people will let me](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m50s)



[know but I do like it when people test](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m51s)



[the preview packages and let me know hey](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m55s)



[things are working things aren't is that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m56s)



[and the other it gives me a little bit](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h14m59s)



[more confidence so I know nobody's using](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m00s)



[it with my apps right now because this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m02s)



[has been horrendously broken let's see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m04s)



[cannot find accented square button style](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m09s)



[ah because this one has changed okay so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m20s)



[I'm gonna put this back to a dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m25s)



[resource just so that it stops crashing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m26s)



[but ultimately we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m29s)



[swap this in for the appropriate new mah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m32s)



[app style which I'm guessing they](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m36s)



[probably just have a new style key for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m37s)



[this should not be hard to track down](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m38s)



[and this this demo app has been fairly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m47s)



[light on the samples so if there are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m50s)



[extra my ops controls that aren't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m53s)



[working I've been trying to go through](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m55s)



[and add them into this demo as we go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m56s)



[just so that things start working hey](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h15m59s)



[there we go that's what we like to see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m03s)



[that's what we like to see boom](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m07s)



[sliders working ok let's go back to this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m10s)



[button let's fix this guy real quick so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m13s)



[this guy here was accented square button](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m17s)



[style so I'm guessing if we jump back](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m19s)



[over to my apps if I look in button I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m21s)



[gonna be looking for something that's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m26s)



[accented in square button styles button](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m27s)



[flat button flat just do a search for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m31s)



[accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m39s)



[do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m42s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m42s)



[buttons accents square that sounds](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m49s)



[pretty close to what I want so this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m52s)



[then going to become a static resource](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m56s)



[drop that guy in fix the compiled air](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h16m59s)



[boom now works that's interesting it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m05s)



[holds its color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m12s)



[it's interesting that that's hanging](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m16s)



[like that is there an output err](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m19s)



[but there there's nothing wired to this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m24s)



[button interesting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m26s)



[I wonder why that's happening okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m31s)



[anyway I'm not gonna stress better right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m32s)



[now so then the numeric up-down control](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m34s)



[so these guys here really should be flat](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m38s)



[button issue styles so let's take a look](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m40s)



[at this so these are just control](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m42s)



[numeric up-down so these are my apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m45s)



[controls so let's go and take a look at](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m48s)



[that numeric up down I'm gonna guess](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m51s)



[yeah that's some of these guys here have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h17m56s)



[been swapped out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m03s)



[there's the textbox that's that's fine](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m08s)



[I'm less concerned about all these lots](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m12s)



[of template binding stuff great great](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m14s)



[great lots of stuff in there lots of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m16s)



[stuff in there most of these shouldn't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m23s)



[be problematic because template bindings](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m25s)



[will get evaluated compile-time](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m28s)



[these buttons here these are these are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m32s)



[ultimately the chromeless button style](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m35s)



[so let's let's hunt these guys down are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m39s)



[these guys expect it to be defined](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m43s)



[somewhere yeah so these guys used to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m45s)



[exist let's go back over to my apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h18m50s)



[chromeless there's the new style key](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m01s)



[boom](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m05s)



[that's what I want](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m07s)



[that goes there on that repo button that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m11s)



[goes there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m15s)



[trying to decide on some of these other](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m22s)



[ones I kind of want to just dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m24s)



[resource kind of I just want to go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m26s)



[through these guys real quick and verify](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m29s)



[what all of these are here because I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m31s)



[suspect some of these things have been](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m34s)



[changed I might I might just hunt all of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m37s)



[these real quick because I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m42s)



[these these color brushes let's just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m43s)



[check live zamel edit and continue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m47s)



[failed me so let's restart because I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m51s)



[noticing these these brushes in here and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m55s)



[I'm pretty sure all of these got swapped](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m57s)



[out not now these ones will work because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h19m59s)



[these are material design brushes but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m03s)



[these other ones are my apps brushes and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m06s)



[I'm pretty sure these all need to be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m09s)



[fixed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m10s)



[we might just take a quick gander](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m15s)



[through the the other controls to see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m17s)



[what else may or may not need updating](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m19s)



[okay so my apps numeric up/down boom](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m24s)



[control template to window style oops](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m31s)



[oops oops oops this is a control](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m34s)



[template I need the style this is what I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m38s)



[want so let's go back yeah yeah yeah I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m47s)



[understand I broke stuff I get it I get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m50s)



[it you're unhappy with me I get it I get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m53s)



[it I get it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h20m56s)



[the dynamic resource does not magically](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m01s)



[cast a control template to a style what](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m04s)



[a shock it does need help okay we will](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m08s)



[fix it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m13s)



[yeah these other ones like this gray](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m18s)



[brush here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m20s)



[I need see here because this is let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m21s)



[see close close close close](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m25s)



[yeah so I think like all of those other](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m30s)



[ones just needs to be swapped out for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m33s)



[these new keys the convenient part is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m35s)



[now we have a list of all of the keys in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m37s)



[here so the white color black color and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m39s)



[I think all of these just need to be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m41s)



[mops brushes etc because it's really](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m43s)



[nice the way that they've reorganized](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m47s)



[all of their resources it makes a lot of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m48s)



[sense and it's easy to find it but it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m51s)



[just means there's a lot a lot of broken](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m53s)



[stuff so ok the buttons are now styled](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m56s)



[correctly but the color resource is not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h21m58s)



[so for example this path is trying to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h22m04s)



[use grey brush one but there is no grey](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h22m07s)



[brush one anymore so we get an empty](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h22m09s)



[color which is not that helpful so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h22m12s)

[new number so zero through nine and then](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h23m51s)



[the plus means any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h23m55s)



[so it's gonna match any any number of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h23m57s)



[digits afterwards right and then we are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h23m59s)

[so all these dynamic resources are good](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h25m44s)



[this is a material design resource so we](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h25m48s)



[know that it'll match validation air](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h25m51s)



[template this is another one that will](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h25m53s)

[content font size](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h26m34s)



[interesting I don't know what to do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h26m44s)



[about that also font-family I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h26m46s)



[these must be together so let's go take](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h26m50s)



[a look and actually real quick let me](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h26m52s)

[let's back up here so I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m12s)



[something hopefully called font fonts](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m15s)



[that sounds close enough](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m21s)



[okay so what are we after here we want](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m24s)



[font size and font family for content](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m30s)



[font content size so that's that's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m44s)



[probably that guy there so that goes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m48s)



[there font family](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m52s)



[I assume because this is content](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h27m58s)



[font-family it's gonna be this one here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m00s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m04s)



[that goes like that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m07s)



[clear-text button font size so let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m09s)



[check here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m12s)

[see text box these are text box brushes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m30s)



[so let's let's let's actually just check](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h28m38s)

[mouse-over border so let's see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m15s)



[mouse-over border the one right below it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m19s)



[this is what I mean the the resource](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m23s)



[names do very much make sense and it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m26s)



[tracks okay so that that fixes all of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m29s)



[the ones for the numeric up-down](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m33s)



[cool](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m39s)



[mayor cup down is mouse over is pressed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m45s)



[changes the color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h29m48s)

[text box and on the border is focused is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m08s)



[keyboard focused okay so those are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m12s)



[really the states that I'm interested in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m15s)



[is mouse over is pressed and it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m17s)



[focused](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m22s)



[and hopefully all of those look great](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m26s)



[so I would really excite me if we could](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m33s)



[merge this in and then and roll out this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m34s)



[nougat package](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m38s)



[I think we will go through these other](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m44s)



[resource dictionaries and just hunt the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m46s)



[dynamic resources out of here just for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m48s)



[the sake of checking them let's see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m51s)



[numeric up/down so focused that looks](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m55s)



[good](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m57s)



[whoa it's not a valid value for property](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h30m58s)

[ooh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h32m18s)



[so the question then is are these things](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h32m27s)



[expected to be color or brush resources](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h32m30s)



[okay let's go and look because I don't I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h32m37s)

[let me look because I think I I think I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h33m42s)



[checked the code out for this reason so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h33m45s)



[that it was easier to hunt it around](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h33m47s)

[working toggles appear to be working](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m04s)



[let's just change the palette out real](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m07s)



[quick to make sure everything just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m10s)



[respecting palette changes so let's do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m11s)



[primary of teal I'm sorry primary of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m15s)



[teal and accent of lime or light green I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m19s)



[guess go back and just make sure these](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m23s)



[things show appropriately so that one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m26s)



[doesn't really have any theming that one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m29s)



[seemed out nicely those appear to a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m31s)



[themed out nicely](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m34s)



[those themed out nicely](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m37s)



[okay cool so everything updated as it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m41s)



[should boot okay so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m45s)



[just gonna run through the dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m48s)



[resources and just kind of spot check](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m51s)



[them real quick and make sure that these](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m53s)



[all lay out correctly so yeah make](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h37m57s)



[resource](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m05s)



[ah let's see here so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m08s)



[this one path icon control](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m13s)



[to find all what is what style do you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m19s)



[think you are supposed to be so you are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m26s)



[not going to resolve so path icon](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m29s)



[content style where is this this is on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m32s)



[the fly out let's come back to the fly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m36s)



[out for a moment because I don't think](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m39s)



[we were testing that very well yet so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m40s)



[that is fine because this is B oh no](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m43s)



[this is not fine this is expected to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m48s)



[change out the fonts on everything to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m50s)



[the Roboto ones and that will not do it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m53s)



[because we saw that back over here the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h38m55s)



[fonts were changed or at least the keys](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m00s)



[for them where so let's just take a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m02s)



[quick look](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m05s)



[fons default](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m10s)



[let's come here this becomes that extra](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m15s)



[points for spelling header font comes in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m19s)



[the other one worked because we properly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m31s)



[switched our key but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m34s)



[that one a toggle switch font-family](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m37s)



[let's see which is this guy here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m40s)



[boom toggle switch header font family](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m48s)



[and I do I do question and I think I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h39m59s)



[might seriously take a look at switching](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m02s)



[over the material design stuff to these](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m07s)



[ones obviously that would be another](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m09s)



[breaking change and I'm not interested](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m11s)



[in adding too many more braking changes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m12s)



[to the 300 release so I think we're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m16s)



[gonna stop where we're at I hope but I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m19s)



[do I do like this style okay so that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m25s)



[handles the fonts we did the numeric](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m28s)



[up-down](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m30s)



[we checked the range slider I think](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m31s)



[that's a horizontal sum with](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m40s)



[it's that one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m44s)



[show me where you define](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m47s)



[not in our library horizontal some width](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h40m57s)



[where's that gonna be oh let's see here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m01s)



[because this is inside of sliders so I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m06s)



[gonna go with in the same spot](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m10s)



[trying to decide](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m25s)



[Adam does that mean you're watching I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m28s)



[can't tell getting getting heckled with](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m30s)



[font-family stuff](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m34s)



[suggesting Cascadia which if you have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m35s)



[not tried it out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m38s)



[it is very worthwhile I probably should](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m40s)



[be switching over all my visual studio](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m43s)



[instances but after my reinstall last](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m45s)



[week I have not gone back to fix it ah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m47s)



[there's the there is the guys we're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m50s)



[looking for oh let's see here so do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m53s)



[horizontal thumb width so let's grab](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h41m59s)



[horizontal thumb I suspect we're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m04s)



[probably going to have there are two of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m09s)



[these hast](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m12s)



[haste](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m16s)



[okay let's go back](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m18s)



[yeah Mac resource we should just be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m21s)



[highlighting in control F okay so that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m24s)



[one we fixed that one's a material](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m28s)



[design reference material design again](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m30s)



[see I like this style of Neiman Keyes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m35s)



[but this style currently only exists](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m38s)



[inside of mops one so let's see vertical](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m40s)



[thumb heights](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m44s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m54s)



[and back here paste](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h42m56s)



[pissed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m01s)



[do this is sort of the quote-unquote](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m03s)



[problem with dynamic resources you don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m08s)



[always catch when resources are missing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m12s)



[because it's not an air if a dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m14s)



[resource fails to resolve it just simply](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m16s)



[doesn't give you one okay and all of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m20s)



[these are material design ones checkbox](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m24s)



[disabled](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m30s)



[yes they are yes they are jerks like](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m37s)



[that okay so let's see here this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m41s)



[okay so that that's a built-in one just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m50s)



[wanted to make sure I hadn't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m53s)



[accidentally turned that one off](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m54s)



[okay so that guy's their window commands](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h43m56s)



[nothing fancy here great okay so the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m01s)



[flyout was the last one we were we had](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m08s)



[to do something weird with the dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m10s)



[resource let's see here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m12s)



[let's just check this guy because I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m19s)



[curious why I didn't see flyout this was](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m21s)



[the view we didn't check](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m26s)



[what is that supposed to be whatever it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m31s)



[is it's clearly getting cropped](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m33s)



[something em](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m38s)



[something m and a couple settings so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m41s)



[let's let's find this in the demo app](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m45s)



[because I don't know flyout content okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m47s)



[this is interesting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h44m55s)



[so one will just kill those extra](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m02s)



[namespaces](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m05s)



[it's got a couple text boxes that are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m08s)



[floating hint text boxes without any](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m12s)



[floating hints I'm not entirely sure](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m14s)



[what to do with this this is this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m19s)



[weird to say the least](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m24s)



[we need to add something to this because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m26s)



[this is not not helpful](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m29s)



[do I ever use snoop yes yes very much](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m33s)



[snoop is actually my go-to tool for any](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m38s)



[sort of UI debugging and quite often](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m44s)



[occasionally viewmodel debugging just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m47s)



[because it's got the built-in support](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m51s)



[for being able to view your view models](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m52s)



[and jump through and just arbitrarily](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m55s)



[invoke methods on them so yes definitely](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h45m58s)



[I tend to turn off the visual studio](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m02s)



[like live visual tree stuff and favored](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m06s)



[using snoop instead just because snoop](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m10s)



[is so much more powerful the ability](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m13s)



[that it gives you for being able to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m15s)



[arbitrarily yeah there's a lot of cool](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m17s)



[stuff the ability that snoop gives you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m21s)



[to basically arbitrarily mess with](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m23s)



[properties and just arbitrarily invoke](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m26s)



[stuff is really powerful if you haven't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m28s)



[played with it on the snoop tab there's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m31s)



[like a powershell repple where you can](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m34s)



[basically start invoking stuff on your](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m38s)



[UI objects in your view model and just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m41s)



[kind of play around with stuff now be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m43s)



[aware you can get your app into](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m45s)



[completely invalid States doing this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m47s)



[like it all bets are off once you start](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m49s)



[messing with it but it pretty much is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m51s)



[the it gives you the power to go through](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m53s)



[and and do what you want with it so it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m56s)



[is it is definitely my my weapon of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h46m58s)



[choice there's a developer Bastion Smit](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m01s)



[I think I'm pronouncing that correctly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m05s)



[who does a ton of work on it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m06s)



[and I know I was seen mentioned from him](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m10s)



[that he's got I can't I don't remember](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m14s)



[whether it's he has dotnet core three Oh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m16s)



[support already in or he was working on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m19s)



[adding it if it's not in its coming](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m21s)



[shortly so if you don't have the latest](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m23s)



[version definitely update as well but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m24s)



[this needs to be updated here so I think](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m28s)



[let's let's let's close some of these](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m33s)



[things down I got I got too much going](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m35s)



[too much going let's see here so the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m37s)



[flyout commands this guy is almost](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m42s)



[assuredly part of our problem so the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m47s)



[question is what did this one used to do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m50s)



[as I think Terrell designed how do you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h47m54s)



[close the tab so a long visual studio](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m01s)



[here middle-click by default on my my](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m03s)



[mouse closes them down I believe that's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m07s)



[default visual studio behavior I never](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m09s)



[intentionally enabled that I don't think](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m12s)



[I have any accent I know there's been](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m17s)



[times where I've added extensions for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m18s)



[doing tab manipulation stuff but I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m21s)



[think I have any installed did nothing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m24s)



[that I would see doing it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m29s)



[resharper is currently disabled so yeah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m31s)



[I believe it's just middle click right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m35s)



[across let's see so material design](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m36s)

[I'm a little surprised good still yeah I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m45s)



[know that I actually just spoke at a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h48m51s)

[I thought the shadow assist class](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m23s)



[actually did this better because this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m27s)



[going to automatically go and resolve it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m30s)



[whereas the shadow assist class is going](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m32s)



[to end up doing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m35s)



[using a it's got a built-in dictionary](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m41s)



[that it's going to use so it'll re reuse](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m44s)



[some of the effects got it but because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m46s)



[this thing doesn't have it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m52s)



[okay that's why it's been done that way](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m54s)



[okay sure](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h50m55s)

[make sure that that still lines up I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m00s)



[don't believe we broke that great so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m02s)



[it's just gonna reuse that shadow depth](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m06s)



[effect perfect okay and then Katie so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m07s)



[control KD is one of my favorite](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m14s)



[keyboard shortcuts for auto format my](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m17s)



[document I also do it you'll notice I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m19s)



[have all of these dots here I tend to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m22s)



[run with white spaced enabled just so I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m25s)



[can see it in the tabs versus spaces](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m29s)



[debate I'm definitely a spaces guy I can](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m32s)



[at least live with tabs as long as tabs](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m35s)



[are the only thing in your document if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m37s)

[and have to replace them don't keep up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h51m41s)

[of Visual Studio you can take advantage](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h52m48s)



[of the new compiler features even if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h52m52s)



[you're targeting an old version of the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h52m55s)



[runtime because a lot of these things](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h52m56s)



[it's just a matter of having the newer](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h52m58s)



[compiler to generate the appropriate il](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m00s)



[code so you can still reference old](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m03s)



[runtimes and old api's and all that but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m05s)



[do it with the newer language feature so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m08s)



[I like to keep track of that page that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m10s)



[one will jump into c-sharp 8 but you can](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m14s)



[walk backwards and take a look at all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m16s)



[the versions of 7 oh yes I understand](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m18s)

[you're doing there was a lot of useful](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m46s)



[stuff that got added I know there was a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m48s)



[lot of features around identity if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m51s)



[you're talking asp net core - Oh or I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h53m54s)

[improved in two - made for the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h54m01s)



[middleware to separate services as a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h54m04s)

[Microsoft ignite announcements so I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m05s)



[might do a run-through of all the stuff](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m08s)



[I think is cool which is probably very](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m11s)



[different I openly admit I am NOT the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m13s)



[normal Microsoft developer so then it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m15s)



[that's not exactly uncommon but I might](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m20s)



[run through at least all the stuff that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m23s)



[I think is awesome and and that so let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m25s)



[see flyout header font size I think this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m29s)



[is another one I need to change since I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m33s)



[got slightly distracted but I do not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m36s)



[mind I I always enjoy talking about this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m38s)



[stuff if it's not apparent I very much](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m42s)



[love my my C sharp and Microsoft](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m44s)



[everything](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m47s)



[let's see fly out sighs so where do you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m49s)



[control your fly out not see fly out in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m53s)



[this list](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h55m57s)



[so you are not in here let me just check](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m00s)



[and make sure these top two ones the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m06s)



[material design body and paper are both](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m07s)



[built-in built-in ones to the material](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m10s)



[design library so I don't think of sam'l](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m13s)



[shouldn't exist though I know a lot so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m18s)



[I'm a big fan of sam'l if it's not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m21s)



[apparent because I'm doing a ton of WPF](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m23s)



[stuff I love it but there are there are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m25s)



[problems with it and yeah well yeah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m28s)



[especially HTML CSS so when it comes to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m33s)



[styling like sam'l is really really](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m35s)



[verbose like you can get six or seven](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m39s)



[levels of nesting without breaking a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m41s)



[sweat for just toggling a simple](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m43s)



[property that where HTML and CSS are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m46s)



[significantly better at doing so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m50s)



[especially in that regard yeah I agree](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m53s)



[with you HTML and CSS do a great job](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m56s)



[Sam xamarin forms their version of sam'l](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h56m59s)



[they actually implemented some basic CSS](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m03s)



[styling for it so you can yeah agreed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m06s)



[the xamarin forms Samuel has CSS styling](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m13s)



[so you can fix some of the the ugliness](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m18s)



[of zamel styles and just use CSS styles](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m22s)



[but it is a little limited and narrow in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m26s)



[scope and what it lets you do we need a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m28s)



[universal UI if that's possible so when](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m32s)



[you I three let me find that guy real](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m35s)



[quick](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m39s)



[I believe so I believe this is going to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m39s)



[be the the way of the future and where](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m44s)



[things are headed to see if I can find](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m46s)



[it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m52s)



[let's see yeah so this is this one's a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h57m55s)



[little bit old but this sort of gives](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m01s)



[some of the information about kind of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m03s)



[what they what Microsoft is thinking and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m07s)



[where they're looking at heading with it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m09s)



[basically right now they've got three](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m12s)



[versions of zamel WPF uwp and xamarin](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m14s)



[forms and they can't agree and they're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m17s)



[there there's lots of subtle differences](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m23s)



[between each of them](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m25s)



[that just kind of start to fall apart](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m27s)



[and so I think the eye and again I I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m29s)



[have no inside knowledge on this so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m34s)



[everything I say here is pure Kevin](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m35s)



[speculation but it's it's trying to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m37s)



[start to bring those things together so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m42s)



[that we stop having to have kind of all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m43s)



[of these bifurcated versions oh yeah and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m45s)



[to some degree I don't know about](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m52s)



[getting other language support like you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m55s)



[can kind of get away with stuff with](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m57s)



[like ironpython but starting to mix that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h58m59s)



[with some of the sam'l stuff gets weird](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m02s)



[and isn't like the tooling isn't really](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m05s)



[there yeah yeah and that's actually one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m08s)



[of the the debates that I run into with](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m13s)



[a lot of co-workers when it comes to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m15s)



[like web-based programming stuff is you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m18s)



[run into a client that needs some app](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m22s)



[built and there's always the question of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m24s)



[well does this need to be a thick client](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m27s)



[or could this be a web app and that's a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m29s)



[very legitimate vote and the the amount](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m32s)



[of stuff that you can do on the web](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m36s)



[keeps increasing and so the the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m37s)



[necessity of a native app gets smaller](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m41s)



[and smaller now there are certain things](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m44s)



[that I think a native app will always do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m46s)



[better at and always have more access to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m48s)



[hardware and be able to do really device](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m51s)



[specific stuff so I don't think they'll](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m54s)



[ever go away but I think the web is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m57s)



[gonna slowly eat up as big of a market](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=00h59m59s)



[share as it can if it hasn't already](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m02s)



[yeah and that is very true it's actually](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m11s)



[one of those so Microsoft's blazer is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m16s)



[it's one of those it's an interesting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m21s)



[looking product to see to see kind of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m23s)



[where it goes because they're trying to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m26s)



[basically get that some people have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m28s)



[described as like silverlight v2 which](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m35s)



[isn't quite fair but it is basically](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m37s)



[that trying to take advantage of a lot](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m40s)



[of the webassembly to be able to run](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m43s)



[your c-sharp in the browser they did](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m44s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m47s)



[they I believe they released blazer out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m47s)



[for server side with client side](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m50s)



[forthcoming don't don't quote me on that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m53s)



[I haven't done a lot of blazer](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m56s)



[I've listened in on some of like their](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h00m58s)



[community stand-ups that they do on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m00s)



[YouTube and it's it's it sounds really](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m02s)



[cool I will be very interested to see if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m05s)



[it gets how the adoption goes because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m09s)



[there's there's all these cool demos and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m12s)



[things that they show off and and I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m14s)



[really want to see less of demo show off](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m17s)



[and more of some companies showing off](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m21s)



[their products built with it because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m23s)



[that's I think that'll be the root of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m25s)



[the real the real test because a product](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m27s)



[that doesn't get adopted just it'll end](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m31s)



[up going the same way as Silverlight and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m33s)



[die yeah yeah and it is it is definitely](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m35s)



[early but it is it is very much a cool](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m40s)



[concept](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m43s)



[yeah browser side MVC 3 yeah yeah it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m46s)



[really is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m54s)



[and it's it's really cool to actually](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m55s)



[see see the stuff go I've got a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m56s)



[co-worker that's very excited for blazer](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h01m59s)



[he's been playing with betas and all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m02s)



[kinds of stuff so yeah again it'll be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m06s)



[it'll be interesting to see I was I am](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m11s)



[so horribly distracted control helpers](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m13s)



[header font size clout header font size](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m16s)



[so my apps something something something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m20s)



[font sizes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m23s)



[etter font size](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m33s)



[flyout header that guy that's the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m38s)



[magical incantation we want yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m42s)



[and I assume by classic ASP you're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m47s)



[referring to it more in the sense where](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m50s)



[it has the state that it sends back and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m52s)



[forth and basically tries to tries to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m54s)



[make a a stateless interaction stateful](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h02m57s)



[yeah you have the magical back-end where](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m07s)



[stuff just just flows and you get to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m10s)



[code as though it it all just works out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m13s)



[of the box without needing to think yeah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m15s)



[and that and now I think would be the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m18s)



[big selling point because that was one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m21s)



[of the nice things with that classic ASP](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m24s)



[with the state being able to flow for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m26s)



[you is it it it made a lot of that kind](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m27s)



[of thinking and state management stuff](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m32s)



[that people have to kind of manually do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m34s)



[all the time a lot of times treated with](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m36s)



[impunity let's see here dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m40s)



[resources we were we were clearing these](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m44s)



[things out so we took care of that I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m46s)



[think it's just this path icon this one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m49s)



[I'm not entirely sure what to do about](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h03m56s)



[because that's I think that's what's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m05s)



[happening is this is going in why is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m09s)



[this so this one may have actually been](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m12s)



[broken for a little while because all of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m15s)



[the icons stuff in my apps got stripped](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m23s)



[out and moved into a separate NuGet](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m25s)



[package I'm curious if we just do I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m28s)



[don't even know if I'm gonna I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m33s)



[even know if I'm gonna hit anything for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m36s)



[icon hamburger menu yeah cuz it goes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m38s)



[through the icon pack so that's all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m44s)



[samples tests samples](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m45s)



[you don't want to work for me might end](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h04m55s)



[up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m00s)



[let's just hunt this real quick i I I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m03s)



[seriously doubt they left this style](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m05s)



[just sitting there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m07s)



[to see here what is the issue because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m18s)



[these ones you might just have to go and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m25s)



[grab this from an old commit and just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m29s)



[bring it in manually because I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m32s)



[really want to have this have to take an](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m39s)



[extra dependency if I can help it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m42s)



[I'd like the only dependency for this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m45s)



[library to just be my apps proper](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m47s)



[without needing to pull in the the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m50s)



[nougat package on top of it or the the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m52s)



[icons need a package on top of it oh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m55s)



[let's see here I wonder if there's an](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h05m58s)



[easy way I can I mean if this commit](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m00s)



[it'll be it'll be findable because it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m05s)



[should exist](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m09s)



[oh that let's go back so we're at an old](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m11s)



[tree I think if we just dive in I can](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m16s)



[probably find my way into it let's see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m21s)



[controls maybe don't see it there so I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m29s)



[was looking for something with like PAC](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m34s)



[icon or icon this is sort of a generic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m35s)



[control back when it existed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m39s)



[that's icon content control boom there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m48s)



[it is so here's the old guy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m51s)



[trying to decide what to do with this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h06m59s)



[because we could just bring this guy in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m02s)



[wholesale where is this header template](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m04s)



[wondering what makes the most sense this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m17s)



[is basically an icon that doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m23s)



[in the library let's just bring this in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m25s)



[wholesale for the moment sure right here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m28s)



[looks great I think what I'll probably](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m33s)



[end up doing is dumping this at a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m35s)



[certain point Knoll to unset value](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m39s)



[converter that probably doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m43s)



[but let me look here let's see so it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m51s)



[gonna be well go find it Auto code](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h07m55s)



[button boom there we go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m00s)



[so let's fire this guy up and take a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m05s)



[look I think this will probably get my](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m06s)



[flyout icon working I'm not sure how](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m09s)



[much I like having to pull this guy back](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m16s)



[in I'm almost wondering if maybe I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m18s)



[abandon this arbitrary path here I kind](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m21s)



[of want to see what this looks like and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m25s)



[then maybe just switch this out for one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m27s)



[of our pack icons that might end up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m30s)



[being cleaner the only drawback with the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m33s)



[pack icon approach is it those things](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m34s)



[change rapidly for anybody who watches](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m39s)



[the repo you'll you'll notice that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m41s)



[almost on a daily basis there's an](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m43s)



[automated process that opens up pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m46s)



[requests to update the icons I basically](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m48s)



[have a nightly run that goes through and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m52s)



[default font what did I do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h08m56s)



[where is default font because that's a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m03s)



[surely wrong I've got a nightly process](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m06s)



[that goes through and runs and checks](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m09s)



[the material design icons for oh yeah](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m11s)



[that's not gonna work it checks the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m15s)



[material design icons for updates and if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m18s)



[it detects one it pulls through it just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m21s)



[pulls it in so and creates a new pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m25s)



[request for me so you'll see those](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m29s)



[things come flying in all the time but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m30s)



[it also means that changes to the icons](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m33s)



[could then end up breaking this not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m37s)



[horribly concerned about that but they](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m41s)



[do make a lot of changes to it and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m44s)



[really when I'm reviewing those pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m46s)



[requests all I'm looking for is to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m49s)



[record any breaking changes but most of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m52s)



[the time it's just additions there's a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m55s)



[few times where they do revamp and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m57s)



[repurpose what they are but most of the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h09m58s)



[time it doesn't matter so fly out so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m02s)



[that really is just the left Chevron huh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m07s)



[so I'm thinking these things need hints](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m18s)



[these things need hints and maybe some](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m22s)



[labels sitting on top of them or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m24s)



[something so this this looks at least](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m26s)



[better though let's take a quick quick](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m27s)



[gander at the other demo app because I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m34s)



[think I might want to just swap this out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m36s)



[for one of our pack icons if it really](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m38s)



[is just a left Chevron like that that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m40s)



[doesn't seem like something I need to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m43s)



[doesn't seem like something I need to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m45s)



[spend a lot of time hacking around and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m47s)



[pulling in old templates and all of that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m51s)



[jazz when when there's probably a built](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m53s)



[in a built in pack icon that'll work](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m55s)



[just as fine or just as well for me](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h10m58s)



[let's see where this goes okay because I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m14s)



[think](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m16s)



[I'm realizing I fixed all of the dynamic](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m18s)



[resources in my MA Apps integration](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m20s)



[library but probably there might still](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m23s)



[be missing stuff in the demo app I'm a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m26s)



[little less concerned about the demo app](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m28s)



[but I do know that people tend to just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m29s)



[fire it up and copy and paste the code](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m33s)



[so let's see icons like contact contact](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m35s)



[comes icon pack something about a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m39s)



[chevron yeah so chevron left I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m45s)



[thinking we just dumped this guy in no](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m54s)



[point in doing a lot of I don't like](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m56s)



[having to do all of this kind of hacky](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h11m59s)



[hacky workaround stuff we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m01s)



[drop this guy in right in place boom](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m04s)



[go do with deal with my name spacing for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m12s)



[me thanks and then I believe we just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m14s)



[bring in this guy make sure we get all](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m17s)



[of our sizing stuff and flow direction](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m22s)



[and all that jazz work worked out and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m24s)



[away we go just make sure this guy looks](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m32s)



[right and I think I'll double check the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m35s)



[dialogue stuff but we haven't made any](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m40s)



[changes to it we'll just make sure that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m42s)



[that stuff all still flows nicely from](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m44s)



[the mobs library and then I think we](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m47s)



[publish move fast and break things](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m48s)



[I'll get that library rolling out the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h12m57s)



[door because I believe we already](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m00s)



[updated the new spec for it I'll confirm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m01s)



[that before I publish it but I believe](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m06s)



[it's set with the next version number](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m08s)



[ready to roll out the door okay so fly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m10s)



[out great](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m16s)



[why is Chevron left showing up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m23s)



[is there some weird flow Direction thing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m30s)



[going on here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m33s)



[because this is the only thing that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m34s)



[should be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m36s)



[so it swaps it out what is going on that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h13m54s)



[isn't it there's nothing in here okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m02s)



[so the question of snoop came up earlier](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m06s)



[let's go take a look because I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m09s)



[very confused](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m12s)



[the the size of this is wrong that could](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m13s)



[just be the subtle difference between](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m17s)



[the path data on this icon and and this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m20s)



[one so we can we can adjust that but I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m24s)



[am curious as to why this thing appears](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m29s)



[to be rotated which is clearly not right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m31s)



[okay so let's track this guy so down](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m37s)



[down where we at](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m44s)



[there's a back button](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m49s)



[content presenter so the this icon](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m53s)



[clearly ends up here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m57s)



[and icon is supposed to be pointed left](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h14m58s)



[but it is clearly not which means](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m04s)



[probably a render transform not there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m07s)



[not there let's keep walking up the food](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m15s)



[tree at least to the button not there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m18s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m21s)



[layout transform there's a scale](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m23s)



[transform on the layout and let's do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m26s)



[left to right as well just to see if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m32s)



[something is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m37s)



[oh I'm sorry not left-to-right flow](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m39s)



[direction](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m44s)



[that one is set](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m46s)



[where are you getting flipped](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m52s)



[you're bound but you ended up with left](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h15m57s)



[to right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m00s)



[and just miss something weird](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m05s)



[okay my dumb or stupid](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m17s)



[scale transform](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m21s)



[that button has it that doesn't okay so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m26s)



[it's somewhere in there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m31s)



[is this scale transform on the back](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m35s)



[button doing anything weird to me see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m39s)



[scale uh haha](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m43s)



[scale X minus 1 there it is okay that is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m46s)



[interesting to me because I did not set](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h16m57s)



[this up did I let's see here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m01s)



[so part back button is this in my](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m08s)



[template or is this somewhere else](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m12s)



[layout transform so we did this to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m14s)



[ourselves why is this here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m18s)



[why is this here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m23s)



[so it looks like this guy is spinning](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m29s)



[this thing around based upon the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m33s)



[position of the fly out interesting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m36s)



[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m42s)



[interesting okay so if that's the case](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m43s)



[I'm sort of wondering if in the interest](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m46s)



[of making this work and I don't want to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m52s)



[deal with changing all of those we just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m57s)



[cheat because if this is what it expects](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h17m59s)



[now it's set up correctly okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m06s)



[so let's deal with the size of this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m09s)



[because the other one was much bigger](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m12s)



[so I want this to be somewhat comparable](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m23s)



[wandering about to do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m32s)



[wondering about potentially making this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m40s)



[thing different font binding this to a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m43s)



[font size](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m48s)



[I might not be a bad idea let's go back](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m53s)



[to this guy here back back back let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h18m55s)



[see that's a search when we're back](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m01s)



[take me back into my list I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m07s)



[thinking that what I might do is cheat](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m09s)



[just a little bit fly out because I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m12s)



[kind of wondering if we do this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m19s)



[static resource boom and actually let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m27s)



[do dynamic resource because these are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m33s)



[ones that could be changing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m35s)



[well that's if somebody wants to change](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m40s)



[it out yeah let it go so let's just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m42s)



[relaunch to make sure this goes because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m48s)



[I'm thinking this will this will end up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m49s)



[bumping the size up because just playing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m51s)



[around with it we ended up at 24 ish I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m54s)



[wondering if setting this here makes a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m57s)



[little more sense](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h19m59s)



[yeah great we'll go with it we'll go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m03s)



[with it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m06s)



[that will get us pretty close](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m17s)



[and I think at some point I should come](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m24s)



[back and revisit these layout transforms](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m28s)



[could not copy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m30s)



[what](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m37s)



[did something not terminate something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m39s)



[holding on to my reference I don't see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m43s)



[it open but that doesn't mean it's not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m46s)



[there somewhere so let's just take a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m48s)



[quick gander](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m51s)



[maybe it was Visual Studio blocking](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m57s)



[itself it looks like it's gonna launch](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h20m59s)



[just fine now okay Visual Studio must](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m01s)



[have just decided it was going to hold](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m04s)



[on to it awesome](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m08s)



[take a look](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m21s)



[yeah because it would be nice to not](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m24s)



[have to deal with that so fly out there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m25s)



[we're gonna we're gonna go with that if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m30s)



[people have strong opinions on that let](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m34s)



[me know I do wonder if that's too small](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m37s)



[yeah we're about that in a minute](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m42s)



[progress dialogue great input dialogue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m44s)



[looks like it's themed correctly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m51s)



[if I change out my palate again and do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m56s)



[like I don't know pink is primary and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h21m59s)



[light green is my secondary let's just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m03s)



[make sure these things style correctly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m09s)



[which it looks like they did this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m12s)



[interesting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m16s)



[these buttons don't look right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m21s)



[why are those colors different let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m27s)



[take a look because I would have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m32s)



[expected this blue to get swapped for a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m34s)



[different color maybe these are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m37s)



[hard-coded maybe they aren't we'll know](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m39s)



[in a second let's take a quick look](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m41s)



[so in snupe once you fire it up you drag](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m43s)



[the crosshairs onto the app you want to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m47s)



[snoop and then the magical keyboard](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m48s)



[shortcut is you put your mouse over the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m51s)



[control you're interested in and hit](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m53s)



[control shift together and it will](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m54s)



[navigate this visual tree down as close](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h22m57s)



[as it can reasonably get so let's see](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m01s)



[here so this is my apps brushes accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m04s)



[what](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m14s)



[thought we changed that resource did the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m15s)



[heart affirmative button just make sure](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m22s)



[that we aren't this isn't us](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m26s)



[this is probably part of the problem](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m35s)



[these keys these are almost assuredly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m40s)



[wrong okay so we need to fix these to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m45s)



[style material design flat button button](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h23m50s)



[so those guys there are just implicit](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m01s)



[Styles on button and button bass but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m04s)



[these ones I'm guessing if we were to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m07s)



[take Snoop here real quick and look at](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m12s)



[the style key or style that's being](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m14s)



[applied okay too much typing style](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m17s)



[filter for me please yeah see this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m20s)



[you note the style key my op Styles](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m24s)



[button dialogues accent yeah so that's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m27s)



[that's probably the problem my apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m35s)



[Styles dialog button accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m41s)



[all right I think that was the right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m49s)



[change let me just check it here real](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m52s)



[quick against](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m56s)



[against the DIF let's see dialogues that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h24m58s)



[one accent dialog square button](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m05s)



[okay so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m12s)



[dialogues accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m16s)



[and then let's check the other one I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m20s)



[suspect I'll see the same thing so it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m25s)



[drove me all the way down in here so we](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m29s)



[just back up to here this guy doesn't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m31s)



[have a style applied to him but I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m35s)



[suspect I need to do the same thing here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m39s)



[so let's just find the docs for this guy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m41s)



[don't think I need that open do I I do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m44s)



[okay let's see so styles and let's jump](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m48s)



[back to buttons because I assume they're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m52s)



[gonna be buried in here so something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m54s)



[about no not the button I wanted](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h25m57s)



[dialogue no they're not there okay so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m00s)



[maybe inside of the dialogue itself to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m04s)



[do I don't see that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m08s)



[dialogue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m17s)



[so seems dialogues oh so these guys are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m19s)



[themes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m24s)



[what](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m29s)



[not there](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m37s)



[where are you where are you buttoned](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m39s)



[yes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m46s)



[back up a level I did today](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m49s)



[seems dialogue maybe in here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h26m56s)



[there we are styles buttons dialogues](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m02s)



[Styles buttons dialogues accent accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m05s)



[highlight so we just did accent pretty](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m08s)



[sure this is our other one boom](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m13s)



[those two guys rinse repeat](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m16s)



[I need to quit saying that I think we're](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m20s)



[very close to done because I clearly](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m24s)



[keep shooting myself in the foot doing](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m25s)



[that clearly but it is nice to see this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m27s)



[thing come together anything else it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m34s)



[seems like every time I open these files](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m37s)



[I keep finding just one more thing just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m39s)



[one more thing there's always just one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m41s)



[more thing there was a project a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m44s)



[co-worker was working on last week and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m47s)



[it was it should have taken about well I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m51s)



[should say we first estimated it at like](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m53s)



[4 to 6 hours 5 days later it's one of](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h27m55s)



[those things just did not go the way](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m01s)



[they were supposed to okay so we've got](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m03s)



[that got that great great great](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m07s)



[okay let's pallet this guy out something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m09s)



[something big of an obnoxious because](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m13s)



[pink and light green is clearly the best](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m15s)



[color theme you can go with no still](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m17s)



[doesn't pick up the right theme](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m24s)



[why why do you not pick up the right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m29s)



[theme I'm wondering if there's extra](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m32s)



[buttons and you know we got the mmm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m37s)



[questions questions questions questions](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m43s)



[questions questions](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m45s)



[okay so this guy drove me down](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m46s)



[affirmative button see the background](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m50s)



[the background more importantly it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m53s)



[it's targeting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h28m57s)



[targeting mops brushes accent just fine](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m02s)



[except for that's the wrong color I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m06s)



[pretty confident we swapped that color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m10s)



[out out see style let's see my up style](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m11s)



[button dialogues accent let's just dive](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m18s)



[into this style and make sure that it is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m21s)



[as expected based on see these ones](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m23s)



[should be based on material design flat](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m27s)



[button so if it picked up mine](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m29s)



[I should see it based on that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m31s)



[let's see setters](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m35s)



[property dynamic resource mops brush](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m40s)



[accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m45s)



[that doesn't look great](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m48s)



[so that's not the good thing why did you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h29m56s)



[not resolve to mind](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m04s)



[why did you not resolve to my to my](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m08s)



[theme you should have and you didn't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m13s)



[okay I mean somebody's closer](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m18s)



[keep walking up my app Stiles dialogues](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m23s)



[accents let's just make sure I didn't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m27s)



[didn't type all this key](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m29s)



[because more importantly if it lands on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m35s)



[the the default one here it should have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m37s)



[four setters if it lands on mine I mean](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m40s)



[it has no setters so back off back on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m46s)



[style so this guy here which one did you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m51s)



[land on how many setters do you have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m55s)



[four setters which looks a whole lot](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h30m58s)



[more like these four and my four](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m01s)



[because the assumption was that this guy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m08s)



[paced](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m11s)



[haha turns out if you don't typo your](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m13s)



[key correctly it won't work](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m16s)



[I do wonder if this is appropriate](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m27s)



[because this is going for an accent flat](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m30s)



[button want to double-check because I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m32s)



[thought we had here's the flat button](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m34s)



[style I thought we had ones that were](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m39s)



[yeah I think we might want to use this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m41s)



[flat accent buttoned this way it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m44s)



[actually picks up the accent color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m47s)



[because if it just goes too straight](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m50s)



[flat button it uses the primary color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m51s)



[rather than the other one hey look at](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h31m56s)



[that that looks better](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m01s)



[okay but the I think I want to change it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m04s)



[so now it's actually picking it up which](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m07s)



[is good I think we're gonna change out](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m12s)



[which material design resource we use](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m15s)



[because I want it to pick up the accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m16s)



[color not the the primary color and I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m18s)



[believe I want to do I think I want to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m21s)



[pick these up too](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m28s)



[at least the size ones because it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m35s)



[weird having your buttons on your](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m40s)



[dialogue be able to shrink so the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m45s)



[vertical alignment I don't think is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m50s)



[something I care about on here but I do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m51s)



[care about making sure my width and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m54s)



[height the properties are sane okay so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m56s)



[now this guy does that now looks funny](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h32m59s)



[that looks funny and I don't like it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m05s)



[when it looks funny I would much prefer](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m08s)



[them to both have this flat button type](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m10s)



[look do so let's come back here so snoop](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m13s)



[in go up part negative button what style](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m18s)



[are you getting applied to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m22s)



[so let's see my app Styles buttons](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m27s)



[dialogues do my apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m30s)



[this guy this is the one we want let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m37s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m42s)



[to do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m45s)



[we don't actually have one so style xkey](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m49s)



[just slap this guy on here and I think](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m56s)



[I'm gonna think I'm gonna broadcast or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h33m59s)



[move these guys out that goes there that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m03s)



[goes there let's see based on cuz I know](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m12s)



[this this version of the library isn't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m16s)



[expected to be a breaking changes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m18s)



[version but it's dependencies both are](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m19s)



[so be aware of that this library](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m23s)



[technically has no breaking changes in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m25s)



[it but the MA apps version and the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m28s)



[material design libraries that it's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m32s)



[dependent upon both do so if you update](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m33s)



[it just be aware I'm not entirely sure](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m36s)



[what the appropriate summer policy is on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m38s)



[that like if I update a dependent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m45s)



[library that takes a major rhythm I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m48s)



[supposed to major rev that one as well](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m51s)



[let's see what are you squawking about](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m53s)



[what are you squawking about cannot](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m56s)



[resolve such a property min height Oh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h34m58s)



[because I didn't tell it what the target](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m03s)



[type was target type and type](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m06s)



[but base](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m14s)



[now I should be able to resolve](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m19s)



[Mountain Dew might actually make it the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m28s)



[whole time little scary though I did get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m29s)



[a whole mountain Dew done before](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m35s)



[starting in on this problem](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m36s)



[looks like](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m44s)



[I think this is quite literally the last](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m47s)



[set of controls to test aside from](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m50s)



[adding some hints to the flyout okay oh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m52s)



[look at that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m58s)



[ooh that is that is an unfortunate color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h35m59s)



[choice](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m09s)



[mmm-hmm that is a very unfortunate color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m16s)



[choice I'm wondering if that makes sense](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m21s)



[so I so I could make this not accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m25s)



[colored and just go straight to the flat](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m28s)



[button then you end up with something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m31s)



[like that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m34s)



[I don't know if I like that better or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m38s)



[worse](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m40s)



[because before this was actually tied to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m45s)



[the accent color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m48s)



[I believe let me just confirm that no](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m49s)



[both of these were tied to flat button I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m52s)



[wonder if that's the reason because the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m56s)



[accent color tends to not necessarily be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h36m59s)



[a readable color it's meant to be a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m01s)



[background color I mean](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m03s)



[now we could take advantage so something](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m12s)



[we could do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m16s)



[so the setter property for ground](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m17s)



[let's see value dynamic resource now the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m23s)



[with the new theming stuff that came in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m28s)



[too sick so we do have access to let's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m31s)



[see where is it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m37s)



[theme assist theme assist we do have](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m39s)



[access to more more colors](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m44s)



[see the because we do have this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m53s)



[secondary dark and I'm wondering if that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h37m57s)



[might be a better better pairing go](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m02s)



[Visual Studio find it find it find it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m10s)



[because that we could then take the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m12s)



[secondary color and grab the darker one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m15s)



[let's see palette helper extensions](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m19s)



[material design](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m23s)



[so we could just do this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m29s)



[I could do this and just bring this guy](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m35s)



[in this is xn base](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m37s)



[we want the brush because we could](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m43s)



[change this guy out let's see back in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m46s)



[dialogues boom something like that right](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m48s)



[I can't decide if I like that better or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m56s)



[not it matches the original intent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h38m58s)



[better](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m03s)



[maybe leave it maybe not let's let's do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m14s)



[the palate thing again oh I can't decide](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m17s)



[this is probably gonna be one of those](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m23s)



[cases where no matter what choice I pick](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m26s)



[I'm gonna break somebody else's workflow](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m28s)



[it's not the right color well that still](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m31s)



[looks like it's picked up the blue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m35s)



[let's let's read relaunch I have a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m40s)



[feeling it's lost its mind somewhere in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m43s)



[the area of me changing all of this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m46s)



[stuff the the live sam'l edit and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m51s)



[continue is nice but it is by no means](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m53s)



[perfect sometimes it can be actually](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h39m55s)



[very not perfect okay](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m00s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m17s)



[some yeah I can't decide a part of me](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m25s)



[just wants to go back and have it be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m28s)



[feature parity it just looks like that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m29s)



[looks like the wrong well hold on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m36s)



[we haven't changed we would change the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m39s)



[theme yet so that okay so I can't say](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m42s)



[it's wrong because the accent color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m45s)



[appears clearly still the blue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m46s)



[okay so there and there now the accent](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m52s)



[color is clearly not blue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h40m55s)



[it's still picking that up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m02s)



[so what is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m06s)



[because I know we're swapping these](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m09s)



[brushes because some of these are being](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m11s)



[picked up dude it's here to move you on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m13s)



[to my second monitor for the moment so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m19s)



[delve that guy let's bring it back in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m21s)



[okay so yeah that's clearly the blue](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m26s)



[which is wrong so let's go back up to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m31s)



[the button and check the foreground](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m33s)



[property](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m35s)



[Wow snoop](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h41m42s)

[it's clearly picked it up this may be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h42m11s)



[this makes me question a few things](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h42m16s)



[because this should have replaced it set](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h42m23s)



[Maps accent brush yeah well okay so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h42m31s)

[the accent color and material design](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h42m57s)



[tends to be a brighter popping color](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h42m59s)



[which means it's almost guaranteed to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h43m02s)



[not look good against a white backdrop](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h43m04s)



[which the dialogues default to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=01h43m07s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h00m44s)



[the big advantage on github is if you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h00m47s)



[have a comment sitting on your pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h00m49s)

[fixes when the pull request completes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h00m53s)



[it'll autocomplete the the issue for you](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h00m55s)



[as well so just a convenience thing if](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h00m59s)



[people don't do it I usually try to keep](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m03s)



[track of issues and go through and close](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m05s)

[hurry up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m40s)



[total tests wow 188 tests are we really](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m45s)



[up to that many that's exciting](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m51s)



[before this library had four tests and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m55s)



[they weren't really testing anything in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h01m59s)



[the library so now we at least have on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m00s)



[the new stuff have some tests and they](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m03s)



[test part of the library the hard part](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m06s)



[is we really can't test because this is](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m09s)



[a themed library so much of it revolves](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m10s)



[around does it look right and that's](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m13s)



[just not an easy thing to unit test food](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m15s)



[all green check boxes that's what we](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m18s)



[like to see come back over here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m20s)

[need to be patient for half a second I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m30s)



[sorry github](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m34s)



[let's see squash and merge bring this](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m35s)



[across great squash and merge we can](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m39s)



[delete my branch now because I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m44s)



[need it and I assume 13:49 is now closed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m46s)



[great and we are now closer closer to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m52s)



[getting this thing fixed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h02m58s)



[so I think there's a couple of these I'm](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m02s)



[probably going to go through and deal](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m05s)



[with at least the bugs in here and get](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m07s)



[those done some of these other ones may](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m14s)



[get may get punted what was this one was](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m16s)



[this just a](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m20s)



[yeah so this is this is warning on debug](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m30s)



[output he should probably get cleaned up](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m33s)



[so if anybody's interested in cleaning](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m37s)



[some of these up let me know that would](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m39s)



[be that would be great but I think I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m41s)



[think 300 is probably going to remain](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m43s)



[fixed unless people report other issues](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m46s)



[this one down here for this snack bar I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m49s)



[only put it back in three oh I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m52s)



[intend to actually fix the full problem](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m55s)



[but there was a comment down here at the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h03m57s)



[end saying that there is a behavioral](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m00s)



[change that happened between two six oh](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m05s)



[and I at least want to address that I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m07s)



[don't think the full issue needs to be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m09s)



[fixed I think it was sort of working and](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m12s)



[then we merged some changes and then I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m15s)



[think we broke something etc etc etc so](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m16s)



[I just wanted to go through and review](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m21s)



[this and it either needs to be](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m23s)



[documented as a breaking change or or](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m25s)



[fix it so if anybody is interested in](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m28s)



[going through and checking it out and at](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m31s)



[minimum testing it and seeing the the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m35s)



[key thing that I was looking for is just](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m38s)



[trying to make sure that I'll just pull](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m40s)



[this up real quick so the the snack bar](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m44s)



[itself is from the material design spec](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m46s)



[is expected to be able to have at least](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m49s)



[two lines of text and it should be Word](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m52s)



[wrapped and bring around here I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m55s)



[know if it explicitly defines what to do](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h04m59s)



[if it's more than two lines if we should](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m02s)



[do like character ellipse or whatever on](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m04s)



[the end but this is the desired behavior](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m05s)



[and so let's comment down here](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m09s)



[saying that before it used to rap on to](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m16s)



[the second line and now it's no longer](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m19s)



[rapping that needs to be fixed so I](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m22s)



[suspect I broke it merging stuff in me](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m25s)



[maybe there's something yeah so I don't](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m30s)



[know exactly what needs to be fixed but](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m34s)



[again I do appreciate everyone who goes](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m36s)



[through and either review stuff for](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m39s)



[comments on poll requests because it](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m40s)



[does save me a lot of time going through](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m42s)



[and looking at them so I think with that](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m44s)



[I am probably going to sign off for the](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m46s)



[night I am teaching tomorrow and I need](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h05m49s)

[little bit more energy to get through](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m02s)

[changes in my apps - oh the our](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m12s)



[integration library will probably say](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m15s)



[stay as a preview release until my apps](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m17s)

[at minimum give me feedback on how](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m27s)



[things look work if there's breakages](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m29s)



[and all of the stuff that I just changed](https://youtu.be/eHYhFeq8pjA?t=02h06m32s)
