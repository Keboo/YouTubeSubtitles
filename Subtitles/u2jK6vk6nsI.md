[okay and there we are so hey guys](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m00s)



[welcome back again we are going to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m03s)



[more material design in zamel tonight my](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m06s)



[goal tonight is to start in on the ma](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m09s)



[apps updates because it's been very](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m12s)



[apparent that us lagging behind in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m16s)



[support for that is causing some grief](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m19s)



[so my hope is that that won't take the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m21s)



[whole time but we'll see how it goes I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m24s)



[do apologize for my tardiness and not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m26s)



[necessarily getting to everything I've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m29s)



[been trying to be as active as possible](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m31s)



[but I've been teaching at a local](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m32s)



[university and so it's been consuming](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m34s)



[more time this quarter than it otherwise](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m37s)



[might have so with that said we are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m39s)



[going to struggle through my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m43s)



[because I I do not know my apps very](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m45s)



[well despite the fact that this library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m48s)



[integrates with it and despite the fact](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m50s)



[that I use it on several projects where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m53s)



[I work so with that said I cannot claim](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m56s)



[to know it very well and I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h00m58s)



[anxious to dive in and look at the two](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m00s)



[Oh changes that are coming and hopefully](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m03s)



[get our integration library updated to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m04s)



[it so with that said let's flip over](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m07s)



[here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m11s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m13s)



[okay so I have just blindly downloaded](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m15s)



[the the latest mah apps source code from](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m19s)



[their development branch so I just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m22s)



[pulled it down grabbed the latest stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m26s)



[and we're gonna start kind of poking](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m27s)



[through this as far as I understand it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m31s)



[most of the changes that are breaking us](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m33s)



[have come from the fact that they've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m35s)



[standardized on their brush names which](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m38s)



[is great I actually kind of like the way](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m40s)



[they've organized it with a dot](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m42s)



[structure and just to try to get](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m44s)



[everything in in a semblance to where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m49s)



[you can kind of guess what the the names](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m51s)



[are going to be I don't know if](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m53s)



[something like that would necessarily](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m55s)



[work as well in this library since we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m56s)



[sort of somewhat coupled to the way](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h01m59s)



[material design names things but I'm not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m04s)



[I'm not opposed to that so if people](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m08s)



[have strong opinions I'd love to see an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m09s)



[issue open and discuss it so theme like](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m12s)



[dark accent colors the demo app works](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m16s)



[just fine so the real question then is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m21s)



[given all of this stuff we've got all of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m24s)



[this the dialog stuff the window stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m28s)



[cool window with glow so you can kind of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m31s)



[see this little glowy effect around the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m34s)



[edge cool cool cool Interop ooh hot](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m37s)



[reload available need to play with that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m43s)



[and see what that's all about](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m46s)



[and cool so this seems to be up and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m50s)



[working so I think the next step is I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m55s)



[just going to pull in the updated](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m57s)



[package on our library and go to town on](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h02m58s)



[it and just see what breaks so for those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m03s)



[no no Visual Studio down so for those of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m07s)



[you unfamiliar with it inside of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m11s)



[material design demos folder we've got a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m13s)



[couple demo apps the basic material](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m16s)



[design demo app which gets set up and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m18s)



[bundled and zipped up every time we do a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m21s)



[release and then we've got this ma apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m24s)



[dragonballs demo this is sort of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m26s)



[multiple libraries buckled into one so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m29s)



[it's showing the MA apps integration as](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m32s)



[well as the dragonballs library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m34s)



[integration I if anybody is interested I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m36s)



[would love to pull into show me the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m40s)



[sam'l stuff that we have in the other](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m42s)



[demo so that you can have nice little](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m43s)



[clickable links to see the corresponding](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m45s)



[stuff okay so this isn't not a whole lot](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m47s)



[here buttons switches sliders numeric](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m55s)



[up-down data grid stuff plus/minus is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h03m59s)



[that's broken that's the wrong style](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m08s)



[okay we'll have to look at that but I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m10s)



[actually not entirely sure what this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m14s)



[thing is running under so it's important](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m15s)



[to note that for this this is going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m18s)



[end up being all of the preview packaged](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m22s)



[stuff so this new spec that we're going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m27s)



[to update here is going to be preview](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m31s)



[stuff and so this MA apps one sixth](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m34s)



[version is going to end up being - OH](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m36s)



[preview stuff so just be aware of that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m42s)



[so let's go back over here packet](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m45s)



[dependencies so you get my apps Metro I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m48s)



[think what we need to do here is just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h04m56s)



[update you to the latest stuff you know](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h05m00s)

[Hackett](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h06m01s)

[kicked it off as well but I just want to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h06m19s)

[hold in the latest suite okay so now](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h06m44s)



[with that well in hand let's fire this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h06m50s)



[up and see what happens](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h06m54s)



[because my goal is to be able to have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h06m57s)



[preview packages for this guy kicked out](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m00s)



[the door so that people who are using](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m03s)



[the my app stuff can start trying it and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m07s)



[tell me what it is this will obviously](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m09s)



[be a preview release because it's going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m11s)



[to be dependent upon their preview](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m14s)



[releases so we'll just see see how that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m16s)



[goes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m19s)



[we'll fire up this demo and then we will](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m22s)



[start hopefully figuring out where all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m24s)



[of the problems are so we know there's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m28s)



[at least the combobox on the dot or data](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m31s)



[grid that we need to address so that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m34s)



[that unfortunately looks like it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m38s)



[working that's too easy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m40s)



[that's too easy this might be a lot](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m44s)



[easier than I thought](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m48s)



[okay then this might be really really](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m54s)



[easy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h07m57s)



[alternate style light dark cool](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m04s)



[okay so let's go let's change primary to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m11s)



[pink accent to teal just so that it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m16s)



[really really obvious well let's pick](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m20s)



[something that's very different than](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m22s)



[what we were before how about orange and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m24s)



[if I go back over here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m29s)



[I should see some number of changes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m30s)



[and these guys appear to have updated](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m37s)



[correctly sweet this is gonna be really](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m41s)



[easy if this is all it takes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m45s)



[still have this guy to deal with and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m48s)



[still have that guy to deal with so none](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m51s)



[of these guys are actually being styled](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m54s)



[out correctly so we just got to deal](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m56s)



[with the data grid and I think a new](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h08m58s)



[spec and we'll see if it works](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m02s)



[it would be nice to be able to have the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m05s)



[MA app stuff back in and going so let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m09s)



[take a look to do it to do it today okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m13s)



[data grid and tab item data grid here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m20s)



[date a grid checkbox column okay so this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m27s)



[is probably problem one so what is the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m32s)



[namespace](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m39s)



[so inside of the material design library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m43s)



[we have our own data grid combo box](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m45s)



[column so I'm expecting something you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m49s)



[know mdi-x data grid combo box column](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m50s)



[let's see here that one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h09m55s)



[so specifically add-in that and that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m00s)



[will probably address that it is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m04s)



[interesting that I don't don't know why](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m07s)



[this guy didn't automatically pick up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m11s)



[the theme for the checkbox column or the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m13s)



[data grid text column let's check the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m17s)



[app dot sam'l and see how this guy is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m23s)



[set up so this is the my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m25s)



[integration stuff and in the mah Apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m28s)



[integration library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m33s)



[let's see themes do to do where's the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m35s)



[controls what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m42s)



[no not that one defaults that's what I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m47s)



[looking for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m50s)



[defaults defaults defaults](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m51s)



[so this guy just references all of those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h10m55s)



[it brings those in none of those should](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m00s)



[be over writing do you have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m04s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m14s)



[material design theme defaults and then](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m19s)



[ours and my apps bundle theme so what is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m23s)



[going on here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m32s)



[because this guy here derives from the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m36s)



[base bundle theme which is our new](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m39s)



[resource dictionary guy great great](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m41s)

[moorthi me stuff great great great now](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m51s)



[the question is where I'm less concerned](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h11m59s)



[with this at the moment because that's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m02s)



[just the drag holes library so the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m03s)



[question is why let's fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m05s)



[and grab snoop and elope](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m08s)



[because I do not understand why it did](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m09s)



[not pick up the automatic theme from](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m12s)



[this so the material design themes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m15s)



[defaults dictionary just to walk people](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m17s)



[through this real quick](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m19s)



[this guy here so if we go into themes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m20s)



[and grab the defaults so you notice this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m23s)



[guy brings in a whole bunch of stuff but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m27s)



[more importantly he sets up an implicit](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m29s)



[style on things like data grid data grid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m32s)



[cell combo row etc etc etc and these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m35s)



[implicit styles are what should be](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m39s)



[giving the the theme the material design](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m42s)



[theme to the data grid but clearly](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m48s)



[something is not working](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m53s)



[so now now we're now we're working so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m56s)



[the as soon as you pull in the theme for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h12m59s)



[the or I should say once you use the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m02s)



[material design combo box column at that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m05s)



[point then you pick up the nice material](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m09s)



[design theme combo box which works as](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m11s)



[you would expect which is great okay so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m14s)



[from there let's figure out this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m19s)



[checkbox column what what is going on](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m23s)



[there and let's just take a just to make](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m27s)



[sure I'm not crazy because in our normal](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m30s)



[demo app underneath grids I believe we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m33s)



[have a data grid very similar to this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m36s)



[data grade checkbox column ooh](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m39s)



[element style](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m47s)



[Oh interesting I wonder if this is the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m52s)



[this is the kicker of what's needed ah](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h13m56s)



[maybe this is just a matter of making](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m00s)



[sure that we copy code correctly okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m02s)



[let's go down here did to do something](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m06s)



[like that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m11s)



[and close quote save and if you do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m12s)



[really love it if that just magically](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m24s)



[worked but let's pick this guy up I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m25s)



[also not a hundred percent confident I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m28s)



[think this is probably failing to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m30s)



[resolve because I think we have to bring](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m32s)



[in the resource dictionary similar to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m34s)



[how this guy brings it in here so I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m38s)



[think this is also going to be required](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m41s)



[so user control so I can just grab this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m45s)



[whole block here we're gonna give this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m49s)



[one more try and just make sure that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m52s)



[it's not something weird from edit and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m53s)



[continues because some of these styles](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m54s)



[to do there we go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h14m56s)



[now the check box is working great let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m02s)



[take a look at the text box to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m08s)



[material design](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m13s)



[text column ooh we should actually](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m15s)



[probably switch it over to this one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m18s)



[material why do we have why do we have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m24s)



[this and not because part one of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m30s)



[braking changes was this data grid combo](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m33s)



[box column material data grid I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m35s)



[wondering maybe we just introduced a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m40s)



[breaking change real quick data grid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m42s)



[because there's all like the the word](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m46s)



[material is not adding much to this here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m49s)



[so let's see here a system windows](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m52s)



[controls let's just derive system](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m55s)



[windows controls](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h15m58s)



[oh you're unhappy because I'm debugging](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m05s)



[fine be unhappy for a minute](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m08s)



[and spelling counts at least most of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m14s)



[time](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m17s)



[okay so derive from the datagrid the the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m18s)



[WPF one and then I think we're gonna](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m23s)



[drop the word material off of this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m25s)



[because this will be at least consistent](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m26s)



[with what we did for the combobox](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m29s)



[column so let's fix this guy here do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m34s)



[jump me up here datagrid comma Bock](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m41s)



[column there so that that's gonna cause](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m44s)



[only a couple breaks clean up that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m48s)



[trailing whitespace clean up this white](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m50s)



[space here might as well clean it up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m53s)



[while we're in here general Boy Scout](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m55s)



[rule always leave the code cleaner than](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h16m58s)



[you found it okay so back over to here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m00s)



[then because this is going to change](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m06s)



[this up so that goes away that goes away](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m07s)



[that goes away because right now we have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m14s)



[the opportunity with this thrill release](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m17s)



[to introduce breaking changes and so I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m20s)



[kind of like being able to bring in the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m23s)



[breaking changes now while I can it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m27s)



[seems to make the most sense but we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m30s)



[gonna get this guy cleaned up as well](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m32s)



[also if people have questions I'm going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m36s)



[to just carry on my merry way and keep](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m39s)



[working through the bugs and this myapp](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m41s)



[stuff but I am also always happy to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m44s)



[deviate and change stuff up so for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m46s)



[anybody who's jumping in late right now](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m49s)



[we are working on the material design in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m53s)



[zamel library and getting the MA Apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h17m56s)



[integration working actually](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m00s)



[well I'm while I'm thinking about it so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m03s)



[there is a for anybody who's who wants](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m06s)

[some time between now and Wednesday](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m12s)



[there is a xamarin forms challenge so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m14s)



[they do these every so often and the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m19s)



[xamarin team is largely just looking to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m20s)



[get feedback from people so in this case](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m22s)



[it's a xamarin forms app and an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m25s)



[your function so it does assume that you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m27s)



[have a free Azure account or an MSDN](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m29s)



[subscription or somewhere where you can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m32s)



[publish an azure function but it rather](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m34s)



[than the other challenges where in the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m36s)



[past it's been hey work through this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m38s)



[feature and give us feedback it's really](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m40s)



[just walk through this tutorial deploy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m42s)



[the stuff out so that you understand how](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m46s)



[to build a mobile app and have it call](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m47s)



[out to Azure to do some work and so it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m50s)



[really just walk through all of it and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m53s)



[and get it deployed so links in the chat](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m55s)



[if anybody wants to do it there I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h18m58s)



[they said it's like the first thousand](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m01s)



[people get an Xbox Live gift card and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m03s)



[then they're gonna draw some names I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m07s)



[forget how many for some surface earbuds](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m10s)



[so if you've got I don't know I'd](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m13s)



[probably say give yourself 45 minutes to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m16s)



[an hour depending on the state of your](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m19s)



[machine if you have to install the the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m20s)



[Sam or toolchain he'll take a little](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m22s)



[longer but then it really is a pretty](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m23s)



[simple thing to just work through and do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m27s)



[so that you can see how all that stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m29s)



[plugs together datagrid checks column](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m31s)



[I'm not distracted at all okay let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m35s)



[here so this now means that let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m38s)



[data grid text column now we just prefix](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m44s)



[it with the material design namespace](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m48s)



[and this guy should magically start](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m50s)



[working I believe](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m52s)



[do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h19m57s)



[actually so this one I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m00s)



[there's a particular there's some](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m02s)



[editing element Styles being applied to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m08s)



[this and I'm kind of hoping I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m09s)



[hoping that there that there's a default](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m15s)



[style being applied to this data great](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m17s)



[x-column already I'd really like it if I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m19s)



[didn't have to explicitly declare this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m22s)



[but if I remember right yeah decompile](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m28s)



[please the the text columns I don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m33s)



[believe derived from framework elements](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m37s)



[so I don't think you can set implicit](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m39s)



[styles on them but I could be wrong so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m43s)



[let's just double check that real quick](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m46s)



[date a grade column yep yep yep yep keep](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m48s)



[going they do have I mean they're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m51s)



[bindable so they derive from did Oh yep](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m56s)



[derived right directly from dependency](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h20m58s)



[objects so no framework elements at play](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m00s)



[at all which is very disappointing very](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m03s)



[very disappointing okay well](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m06s)



[let's take a look and see how this goes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m12s)



[because if this do you give me a nice](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m14s)



[text box no you don't darn it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m18s)



[well well well well we'll walk walk walk](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m22s)



[okay well bring it over so this comes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m28s)



[across like this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m36s)



[and this should just magically work hmm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m39s)



[solution to every call more mountain dew](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m45s)



[do let's see where this goes if we get](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m54s)



[this guy done I'm gonna push out the the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h21m58s)



[nougat package and we'll have a brief](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m02s)



[look at pipelines to see how that is set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m04s)



[up because I haven't actually pushed out](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m07s)



[this MA apps library there we go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m09s)



[so it's got the the pop-up text box](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m12s)



[style with the little underline and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m14s)



[whatnot so that that looks like it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m16s)



[working rather nicely the vertical](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m20s)



[alignment on these is annoying me but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m24s)



[I'm trying to decide if I if I adjust it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m28s)



[now or not doesn't theory I don't really](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m32s)



[want to have to dive all the way in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m37s)



[don't really want to have to dive all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m40s)



[the way into the cell editing styles now](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m42s)



[we'll leave it for now okay this seems a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m44s)



[little too easy I was expecting more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m49s)



[breakages but I do want to get this get](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m52s)



[this going so let's let's just double](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h22m57s)



[check a couple things really quick so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h23m00s)



[this guy here to this extension method](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h23m03s)



[this set ma apps this is where all of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h23m09s)



[the magic happens and I'm wondering this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h23m12s)

[at least committed for the moment and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h25m38s)



[then see where that takes us okay so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h25m40s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h25m49s)



[great branch fix mops so we'll get](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h25m50s)

[could just stash but I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m02s)



[trust myself that much and that changed](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m05s)



[there see what the packet lock file did](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m10s)



[to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m13s)



[so that pulled that in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m20s)



[okay I don't see any problems here let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m24s)



[see that's fine that's just dependencies](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h26m32s)

[see my apps integration](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m05s)



[okay so it changes great so there's that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m10s)



[and let's just when in doubt](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m15s)



[not a hundred percent confident that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m20s)



[that the problem isn't Visual Studio not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m24s)



[letting go of the letting go of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m29s)

[in your directory that's not under](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m51s)



[source control so be careful and make](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m53s)



[sure you've got your stuff committed](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m55s)



[before you run it because it is it is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m56s)



[very very abusive](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h27m59s)



[go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m05s)



[okay back to material design library and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m08s)



[then we just need to figure out what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m13s)



[happened and why my brushes work as it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m15s)



[is bothering me that they work I sort of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m21s)



[would prefer failure but it was good](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m24s)



[that we got the the datagrid stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m27s)

[wants to go through and add this show me](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m31s)



[the sam'l stuff the same way that's in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m33s)



[the other demo app I would appreciate it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m35s)



[I don't know if I'm going to have time](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m38s)



[to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m41s)



[okay so key thing here all of these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m42s)



[dependencies need to be resolved let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m46s)



[let's recompile and see what comes of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m49s)



[this so I figure if we get the the MA](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m54s)



[app stuff published where people can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h28m57s)



[play with it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m00s)



[the 300 release is getting down to where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m01s)



[the there's just some of the harder more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m04s)



[problematic bugs and so I think getting](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m07s)



[those fixed we'll see how many of those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m12s)



[I get a chance to snipe off I've got a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m14s)



[reasonable backlog of stuff that I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m18s)



[supposed to be working on](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m19s)



[to go visual studio go you can restore](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m23s)



[all the things I promise I promise you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m27s)



[can find them all you can download them](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m32s)

[only a couple so let's go find all of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m38s)



[the stuff pack it Ron go pack it go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m43s)



[let's see you source control build do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h29m49s)



[yeah and I fully expect this to fail at](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m02s)



[a minimum to show me the sam'l stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m04s)



[should fail it out but that one is just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m06s)



[a rebuild and away you go a package](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m11s)



[that's a file missing you get packaged](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m18s)



[your store blah blah blah come on](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m21s)



[there we go mops Metro that's what we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m30s)



[looking for - oh baby and I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m36s)



[trying to decide how to release this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m43s)



[nougat package do I set a minimum](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m46s)



[version - a preview release hmmm not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m49s)



[entirely sure I like that but if I leave](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h30m59s)



[it at 1 6 5 or 1 6 star whatever is the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m02s)



[minimum release it means people who](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m07s)



[install it in dotnet framework by](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m09s)



[default with the old packages config it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m12s)



[defaults to lowest and so they're gonna](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m15s)



[be broken I suppose if you were instead](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m17s)



[of like how likely is it that somebody's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m21s)



[gonna install a preview version of my](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m23s)



[nougat package and not update to the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m25s)



[preview version of my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m27s)



[I wonder how likely we use case that is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m29s)



[okay demo app my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m34s)



[let's see here let's make you the start](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m41s)



[of project because we need that double](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m43s)



[check my dependencies because I want to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m47s)



[see my ops - oh great launch now we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m49s)



[should see some breath some brushes fail](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m54s)



[oh hey Megan so just curious is this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h31m56s)



[projects supposed to be a huge library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m01s)



[of different WPF controls and style](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m03s)



[examples to use in external projects so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m05s)



[the answer is yes and let me for anybody](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m07s)



[who's just sort of curious at it let me](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m14s)



[just give a kind of a brief overview so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m16s)



[there's there's two apps at play that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m18s)



[we're working with so I run a library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m20s)



[called material design and zamel so I am](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m24s)



[not the original author I am just the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m27s)



[the current maintainer because the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m29s)



[original author didn't have a lot of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m31s)



[time to work on it and I thought it was](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m32s)



[fun and so I said sure why not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m34s)



[so the the whole idea here is it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m37s)



[supposed to bring Google's material](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m40s)



[design so you can think of like the the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m42s)



[Android look and feel and let you write](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m44s)



[WPF apps with that look and feel and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m47s)



[it's designed to be fairly simple the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m51s)



[getting started guide under the wiki](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m54s)



[will show you what's necessary its](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m56s)



[install a nougat package and then a few](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h32m58s)



[changes to your app dot sam'l to get up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m02s)



[and running so that is that is this one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m05s)



[so there's depend on what version you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m10s)



[have the two six zero you can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m12s)



[technically do this bundled theme stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m15s)



[in the two 600 but it will give you a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m17s)



[design time warning your app will still](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m18s)



[work it's just the way this was set up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m21s)



[it doesn't play nice but then you can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m23s)



[have nice theming so a couple lines of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m26s)



[code in your app dot sam'l and away you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m29s)



[go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m31s)



[and you get all of the pretty styles and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m31s)



[themes so that's the material design and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m34s)



[zamel toolkit there's another library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m36s)



[called ma apps metro or my apps as most](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m39s)



[people will reference it it was](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m43s)



[initially set up the metro is I believe](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m45s)



[an old holdover name from](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m48s)



[Windows 8 apps when they first launched](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m50s)



[it was called Metro theme but my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m53s)



[was designed to give WPF apps a lot more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h33m57s)



[control over your window and was also](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m00s)



[another theming library the thing is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m03s)



[there there's a lot of overlap between](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m05s)



[these two libraries in that they both](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m07s)



[offer you styles and extra controls that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m08s)



[you can use in WPF apps but whereas the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m11s)



[material design and zamel library is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m15s)



[very opinionated about this needs to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m17s)



[adhere to Google's material design my](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m19s)



[apps takes a different route and goes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m21s)



[more with the Metro look and feel but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m24s)



[they also go to the effort of adding a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m27s)



[bunch of windowing controls and extra](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m29s)



[functionality that I don't think it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m32s)



[ever gonna make it into the material](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m35s)



[design library so sometimes people are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m37s)



[want to mix and match because they want](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m39s)



[all of the the fancy stuff that my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m41s)



[offers but then they also want the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m43s)



[material design theme for stuff and so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m46s)



[there's an integration library that goes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m48s)



[kind of between those so that you can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m51s)



[mix and match and use whichever one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m53s)



[makes sense so let me copy I know how to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h34m54s)

[there's actually quite a few of them](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m18s)



[that that go over the material design](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m20s)



[library largely because I really like](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m22s)



[WPF I really like zamel and I think it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m26s)



[awesome and so I spend a non](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m28s)



[insignificant amount of time working on](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m33s)



[this library because I think it is cool](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m35s)



[and fun so yeah there's that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m37s)



[oh let's see so did you I think we just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m43s)



[rebuild here because those are not quite](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m49s)



[the heirs I expected but I also didn't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m53s)



[expect the initial bill to work so we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m55s)



[gonna kick this off one more time and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m58s)



[just see cuz I think that's just a clean](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h35m59s)



[rebill yeah and if you plan on playing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m01s)



[with it you may see a WPF assignment in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m05s)



[the future that leverages one and/or](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m09s)



[both of these so preview head start](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m10s)



[because there will be so the the class](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m17s)



[that I'm teaching at the University](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m22s)



[there is a portion of it that will be](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m23s)



[covering WPF because as part of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m26s)



[class we have to teach event and driven](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m28s)



[programming so the easiest way to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m31s)



[that is with a GUI framework and because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m34s)



[I love WPF WPF it is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m37s)



[come on Visual Studio go go go go go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m48s)



[I know I told you to rebuild everything](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m51s)



[but I I trust you can figure it out I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m53s)



[trust you can figure it out so now that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h36m55s)



[we actually have the two Oh stuff pulled](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m01s)



[in I'm fully anticipating that that we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m03s)



[should have binding fails okay so this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m08s)



[guy is still breaking event trigger does](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m12s)



[not exist in the zamel namespace one why](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m18s)



[are we using event triggers in the first](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m22s)



[place then triggers are bad oh that's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m24s)



[why because I updated the interactions](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m29s)



[library whew okay so what do we got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m34s)



[going on here so command](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m39s)



[close command Wow okay so let's let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m45s)



[nest some of this a little bit more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m48s)



[because this is hard to look at so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m50s)



[that named clique were using wait what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h37m58s)



[event trigger close flyout action](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m08s)



[so we've oh I see because this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m11s)



[leveraging the close flyer I got you I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m16s)



[got you I was trying to figure out why](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m19s)



[the heck this was using the action](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m21s)



[rather than just a straight-up command](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m22s)



[on a button and there's the explanation](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m25s)



[right there because of this guy great](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m31s)



[that's not quite what we wanted](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m39s)



[basically the short version is the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m43s)



[interactivity library no play nice with](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m48s)



[event triggers](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m52s)



[verify that you are not why](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h38m58s)



[so I'm maybe I'm I must be stupid but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m03s)



[there a reason I can't just do that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m08s)



[let's see trigger action collection](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m13s)



[then name I believe its button dot click](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m19s)



[then trigger oh this is routed event](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m27s)



[isn't it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m29s)



[but click I guess I'm just curious where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m33s)



[this guy gets used let's go back over to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m38s)



[the my ops library I'm sure they've got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m41s)



[an example in here somewhere](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m44s)



[do oh that's turns out if you only](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m47s)



[search in the current project you only](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m52s)



[get results from the current project so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m54s)



[let's go entire solution real quick cuz](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h39m56s)



[I'm curious how they use this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m02s)



[so basically this is a copy and paste](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m12s)



[from there's interesting so then the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m14s)



[question becomes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m19s)



[how or what are you using for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m23s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m29s)



[let's go look real quick because I don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m34s)



[understand what this guy is using for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m36s)



[his version which must not be latest so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m41s)



[we might have to roll that library back](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m45s)



[doo-doo-doo-doo](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m49s)



[let's go back maps Metro okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m50s)



[so this is actually one of the the few](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m54s)



[things that's really great about packet](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m56s)



[is when I want to understand what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h40m59s)



[somebody's what version they're using I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m01s)



[don't have to go hunting all over their](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m03s)



[repository to define the references or](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m06s)



[figure out which projects are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m09s)



[referencing it it's just I can go look](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m10s)



[at their packet dependencies and be done](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m12s)



[which is wonderful wonderful wonderful](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m14s)



[yeah close close go away so they aren't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m20s)



[hmm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m35s)



[so hold on here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m38s)



[wait am i seriously oh no no this isn't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m44s)



[my coat okay who I was like what the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m47s)



[heck why am i targeting so many](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m50s)



[frameworks right back to here dotnet](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m51s)



[core app packages one of you guys is not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h41m57s)



[like the others and somebody is bringing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m02s)



[in no where's the interactivity one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m04s)



[somebody is bringing in this reference](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m13s)



[and I don't know where it's not there](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m15s)



[okay so let's check it up at a higher](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m20s)



[level not there](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m23s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m30s)



[not there there so there is a new](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m35s)



[interactivity nougat package just a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m38s)



[little baffled as to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m47s)



[ah there's the there's the guy we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m52s)



[looking for I bet you that's the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m56s)



[difference I bet you it's changed](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h42m59s)



[namespace yeah there's the subtle](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m02s)



[difference okay so back to get crackin](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m05s)



[and this guy here discard all changes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m10s)



[let's go back let's go back so I believe](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m14s)



[the issue is that namespace include](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m18s)



[there](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m25s)



[less unhappiness more happiness let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m28s)



[see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m32s)



[that guy they're a little less concerned](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m37s)



[with that a little less concerned with](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m43s)



[that so now bill okay that should](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m46s)



[hopefully address that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m49s)



[so I updated the library I just didn't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m56s)



[update the usages of it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h43m58s)



[so lesson learned when you update your](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m06s)



[library your namespace includes should](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m08s)



[be updated to match otherwise you end up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m10s)



[scratching your head for a little while](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m13s)



[being confused to do okay are we good to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m15s)



[go now you're done yelling at me for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m25s)



[stuff I think it's happy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m27s)



[I think it's happy I'm happier](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m31s)



[okay that's more like it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m37s)



[that's more like it cannot locate theme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m41s)



[so we've got a reference to styles](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m46s)



[accents based light and that is no](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m49s)



[longer the case identity to do so let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m51s)



[jump over real quick and look at their](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m55s)



[demo app what is the new way of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h44m59s)



[configuring so they've got controls and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m02s)



[fonts underneath the styles which I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m11s)



[believe matches controls and fonts](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m13s)



[underneath styles we pulled in colors](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m16s)



[they do not styles themes light blue](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m21s)



[okay let's grab it so this guy here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m30s)



[styles themes light blue apparently that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m37s)



[guy doesn't need to exist I'm somewhat](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m41s)



[curious if we actually need this to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m43s)



[exist only because in theory once we get](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m46s)



[this bundled theme working appropriately](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m50s)



[with their style keys this guy should](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m51s)



[probably be adding everything that's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m55s)



[here don't know that for a fact but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m56s)



[we'll find out shortly so this one may](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h45m58s)



[become optional which should make this a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m01s)



[little bit nicer to work with because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m04s)



[having to remember all of these and copy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m07s)



[all these is up pain in the neck for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m09s)



[reference I can't remember them all so I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m12s)



[end up coming back and just grabbing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m14s)



[them so let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m17s)



[due to bundled themes secondary color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m19s)



[uh so this is actually coming from here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m29s)



[now or I guess it was coming from here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m32s)



[the whole time and I was just too stupid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m34s)



[to notice](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m36s)



[so where is this well let's just grab it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m44s)



[I guess and hijack it here because I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m48s)



[believe this is where it's breaking](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m51s)



[because it applies the theme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h46m58s)



[so the theme that comes in so this item](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m01s)



[object is new and version 2 6 so it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m03s)



[basically is just a poco with all of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m11s)



[material design brushes in them so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m14s)



[nothing fancy and this guy comes in here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m17s)



[call set theme this guy comes in here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m21s)



[grabs it and basically just does a whole](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m26s)



[bunch of brush letters because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m29s)



[reasons there's a fancy new thing in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m35s)



[Visual Studio 2017 this so this little](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m38s)



[green arrow if you hover near the edge](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m40s)



[of your code click run to point done](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m41s)



[let's see so it adds the theme manager](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m45s)



[grabs the old theme pops an event which](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m47s)



[in this case doesn't do much here goes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m52s)



[through here base theme it's set to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h47m56s)



[inherit great fine set my apps this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m00s)



[where it's going to break because this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m09s)



[is where it was hunting for the existing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m12s)



[ma apps resource theme library didn't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m16s)



[find it goes hunting because before you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m19s)



[used to set base light or base dark it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m23s)



[goes to create this goes to create a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m26s)



[resource dictionary and goes boom okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m28s)



[so that at least makes sense White's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m30s)



[crashing so we have a problem here in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m32s)



[that before we had light and dark theme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m38s)



[stuff and made assumptions on it and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m40s)



[those are no longer true so let's go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m43s)



[here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m48s)



[we've got a theme template](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m56s)



[which this is actually probably going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h48m58s)



[be gold because this is this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m00s)



[basically all of their brushes yeah so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m03s)



[these guys because you can see each of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m13s)



[these that come through this generates](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m15s)



[up the theme great so this is oh](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m17s)



[interesting so they'd no longer have a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m21s)



[light and a dark or I should say they no](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m24s)



[longer had a light theme and a dark](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m29s)



[theme they've separated them out based](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m30s)



[upon these guys interesting okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m33s)



[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m47s)



[interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m49s)



[well well then that is less than](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m54s)



[convenient because that means that at](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h49m59s)



[least for this purpose this is this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m05s)



[completely worthless](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m08s)



[so set ma apps base theme there is no](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m09s)



[concept of base theme anymore so this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m14s)



[becomes one easy method to port I do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m16s)



[have my delete key okay so that that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m20s)



[goes away because that's no longer](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m25s)



[meaningful](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m28s)



[because there is a bit of a an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m34s)



[assumption that if you're using the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m36s)



[material this material design library](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m37s)



[with my apps you're accepting the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m39s)



[material design theming and basically](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m41s)



[you're just looking to theme my apps to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m44s)



[look like material design you're taking](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m48s)



[them for functionality not for theming](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m50s)



[sure step step step step over look at](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m55s)



[that should launch now should at least](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h50m59s)



[launch and I'm guessing things are not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m05s)



[going to look right well actually that's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m07s)



[a lie because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m10s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m11s)



[cannot find resource named yeah so it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m16s)



[missing some themes and it loaded some](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m20s)



[themes okay okay so they don't have the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m22s)



[concept of accent anymore or at least](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m27s)



[they've they've bundled it all together](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m33s)



[so yeah so they they have bundled this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m35s)



[is interesting so they have bundled the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m43s)



[accent colors and the primary colors all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m46s)



[into a single theme dictionary itself](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m50s)



[that they Auto generate from a given](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m54s)



[template and some generator parameters](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h51m56s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m02s)



[these are all the colors that go in and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m05s)



[then they generate the appropriate](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m08s)



[brushes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m09s)



[so let's see so there's light dark and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m15s)



[then this basically just does light](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m21s)



[amber dark amber generate all of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m24s)



[things out okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m27s)



[well that makes it at least easy I know](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m30s)



[where to look makes it a little more of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m33s)



[a pain in the neck for figuring out how](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m37s)



[to implement this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m41s)



[because now we don't really have this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m46s)



[concept as much well I guess we kind of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m49s)



[do we kind of do so each of these things](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h52m55s)



[let's just pick on one mops black so it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m03s)



[generates the colors okay so this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m09s)



[this is just gonna be sure yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m12s)



[yeah yeah this feels like a regex](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m16s)



[problem wondering if I can use this I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m18s)



[wondering if I can use this to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m27s)



[auto-generate my code that's a lot of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m31s)



[lines of code to have to type and I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m36s)



[incredibly lazy but the laziest](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m38s)



[developer always finds the easiest way](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m42s)



[to do things mostly due to being lazy so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m43s)



[I'm trying to decide if it's worth](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m51s)



[coding all these in or at minimum just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m56s)



[extracting all these these values out](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h53m59s)



[because ultimately we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m03s)



[having to duplicate what this generator](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m06s)



[does and I'm wondering if if it makes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m10s)



[sense to try and leverage leverage this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m13s)



[specifically leverage this theme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m19s)



[template](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m21s)



[hmmm wandering wandering wandering](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m31s)



[wandering wandering because if we can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m35s)



[embed these guys in here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m40s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m41s)



[to do this guy just then magically](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m46s)



[starts working](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m51s)



[I'm wondering if we can repurpose this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m57s)



[because it'd be really great to just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h54m59s)



[download this and have it run and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m02s)



[generate all of the code that we that we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m04s)



[need for this do-do-do-do-do-do-do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m07s)



[because packet has a wonderful feature](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m12s)



[where it can pull down arbitrary files](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m14s)



[from in another git repo so that we can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m18s)



[then use it in ours that's ultimately](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m22s)



[how someone like the control e^x stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m25s)



[like the Papa px are getting included in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m27s)



[the library is they're just being file](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m30s)



[linked in via packet pulling them down](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m32s)



[rather than having to reference an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m35s)



[entire new get package and I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m36s)



[if that makes the most sense here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m38s)



[because I have to kind of duplicate a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m44s)



[little bit I'm a little less concerned](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m46s)



[with doing this I'm mostly concerned](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m50s)



[with pulling in these parameters and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m52s)



[getting these values right because this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m54s)



[is where I see see changes occurring I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h55m55s)



[thinking this might become a PowerShell](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m00s)



[script here pretty quick](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m02s)



[default values base color scheme because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m08s)



[the difference is is rather than wanting](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m12s)



[to generate zamel I want to take in this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m13s)



[file as an input and generate out code](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m15s)



[for this but does it really make sense I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m21s)



[don't actually need these brush colors](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m24s)



[because what's going to happen is I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m30s)



[going to take the material design colors](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m32s)



[and put them in their place and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m35s)



[potentially reuse some of these yeah](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m39s)



[let's just hard code let's just hard](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m41s)



[code because I don't see us making a lot](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m43s)



[of use so I'm going to just dock these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m47s)



[guys to the side for the moment and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m48s)



[we're just gonna start start plowing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m51s)



[through this so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h56m54s)



[let's undo undo](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m01s)



[undo undo undo so this guy here is going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m06s)



[to become very different so let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m09s)



[switch on base theme which is just an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m16s)



[enum for basically light-dark case base](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m20s)



[theme light](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m24s)



[okay face dark](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m30s)



[okay and I think what we need is to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m38s)



[would set color this is very similar to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m44s)



[this set brush that we have here where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m51s)



[is this class living](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h57m58s)



[to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m03s)



[okay so I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m10s)



[I'm just gonna plow through this and go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m16s)



[so I think we're just going to regex](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m28s)



[this in once we figure out so the for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m30s)



[example the very first line in here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m32s)



[underneath light looks like this right](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m34s)



[so I'm pretty sure what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m39s)



[to do something like set color give it a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m41s)



[key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m46s)



[and then](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m50s)



[color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m52s)



[let's see from argb where this is going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h58m58s)



[to be 0 X F F a0 X 0 0 X 0 0 0 X 0 0](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m05s)



[alright so we want something like that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m15s)



[we want this thing to take a string key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m19s)



[and a color color and then this does](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m22s)



[resource dictionary key color right this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m30s)



[isn't buying us a lot aside from what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m38s)



[we're about to do next okay so this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m41s)



[this is basically what we want are you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m44s)



[squawking about that's basically what we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m48s)



[want so let's now let's have some fun so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m50s)



[I'm gonna go over here do this so this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=00h59m58s)



[is all the white stuff put a couple](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m02s)



[blank lines in this is all the dark](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m05s)



[stuff right](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m09s)



[okay so usually when I'm faced with](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m13s)



[something like this my first instinct is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m14s)



[to regex the problem away let's make](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m17s)



[this where is my zoom](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m21s)



[you don't have zoom](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m33s)



[in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m39s)



[Wow that is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m41s)



[Oh control equals my mistake I was not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m46s)



[using the right command okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m50s)



[so control F to get this guy up and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m52s)



[enable awesome mode so we're gonna go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m56s)



[from start of line whitespace any number](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h00m58s)



[of characters replace it with empty](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m02s)



[string replace all okay so we've got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m04s)



[everything indented so again remember](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m08s)



[we're looking to call set color with key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m13s)



[so let's let's go ahead and do that so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m16s)



[then the next thing we need to do is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m19s)



[match on quotes and actually we could](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m22s)



[probably do is let's do a color we'll](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m26s)



[just do number to capture group so this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m32s)



[will be the set of all characters that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m35s)



[are not equal to : so we're just going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m37s)



[to grab it all up there set one or more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m41s)



[right will then match on the : we will](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m47s)



[then white space any number of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m52s)



[repetitions mix-ups that will grab the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h01m56s)



[the quote and the pound and why did I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m00s)



[lose this one down here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m05s)



[quote pound oh because this drops here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m07s)



[we'll come back to you in a minute](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m10s)



[let's see and then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m13s)



[name capture group and this is going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m16s)



[match zero through nine a through F](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m19s)



[exactly two repetitions all right so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m25s)



[that's gonna and then we're gonna](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m29s)



[duplicate this over let's see a our G B](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m30s)



[right and then just for completeness](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m35s)



[sake we're gonna grab quote boom just so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m39s)



[we can clear out the line okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m42s)



[we're then going to replace this hold up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m44s)



[something's something's amiss I expected](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m48s)



[these ones to match and they didn't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m52s)



[let's see here so oh the Alpha is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m54s)



[optional so let's go back to the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h02m59s)



[beginning so this capture group is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m01s)



[optional](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m05s)



[okay I've got a regex that looks like](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m08s)



[it's matching most of these did you do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m11s)



[one two three four five six seven eight](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m17s)



[oh the comma at the end we'll also make](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m22s)



[optional boom so just doing a quick scan](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m27s)



[to make sure we've got these couple](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m30s)



[disabled ones that I'm just gonna do by](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m31s)



[hand it's not worth it's not worth](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m34s)



[getting anything fancy for so we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m36s)



[gonna replace it with set color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m38s)



[replacement group one so captured group](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m40s)



[zero is the entire match dollar sign](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m44s)



[number gives you the capture group](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m47s)



[inside of the first set of parentheses](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m50s)



[so this guy here where we grab the name](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m52s)



[that will include the quotation marks](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m54s)



[because it was everything up to until we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h03m57s)



[hit the colon so we'll do that and then](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m00s)



[let's jump back here what was the code](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m03s)



[that we needed color from a RGB right so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m05s)



[we're gonna do this color from a RGB](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m13s)



[this is going to be dollar sign to let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m16s)



[see it's gonna actually going to be 0 X](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m22s)



[dollar sign to this one will be 0 X](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m24s)



[dollar sign three](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m28s)



[0x dollar sign for 0x dollar sign five](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m31s)



[right replace all okay so this gets us](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m38s)



[not quite what I expected so the set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m44s)



[color did not pick up everything so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m47s)



[here's the wonderful part undo still](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m50s)



[works let's see so this guy here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h04m52s)



[hey what's going on with your studio](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m02s)



[code did you lose your mind](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m05s)



[hello what's going on I I think I may](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m10s)



[have killed V s code](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m18s)



[is it is apparently going crazy and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m22s)



[doesn't quite know what to do about this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m26s)



[the window is no longer responding oh](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m29s)



[please don't make me well points awarded](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m33s)



[for it rigged for it at least trying to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m38s)



[recover extra points if you remember all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m40s)



[my stuff nope this is not a WSL file Oh](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m42s)



[Oh sad day ok here we go again so set of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m47s)



[all characters that do not include a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h05m57s)



[coland any number of repetitions or at](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m00s)



[least one repetition right then we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m05s)



[gonna pick up : then we're gonna pick up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m07s)



[whitespace any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m10s)



[wanna pick up the quote we're going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m13s)



[pick up the pound and then we're gonna](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m16s)



[do let's see we said this was the set of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m18s)



[all things that were see zero through](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m23s)



[nine a through F exactly two repetitions](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m26s)



[and then we were going to do this let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m35s)



[see the Alpha Channel we said was](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m38s)



[optional and then RGB this becomes set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m39s)



[color see dollar sign one color from a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m45s)



[RGB let me just grab this again copy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m52s)



[paste this becomes dollar sign two](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h06m58s)



[dollar sign three dollar sign for and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m05s)



[dollar sign five and this guy here we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m12s)



[had picking up closing quote and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m17s)



[optional comma and replace so that gets](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m20s)



[us pretty close](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m26s)



[let's go undo one more time because I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m30s)



[noticing I missed a closing parentis mi](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m33s)



[colon the place and that gets it pretty](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m40s)



[darn close see that regex](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m47s)



[for the win](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m50s)



[okay so this guy here I believe light](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m53s)



[was on top if I remember correctly](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m57s)



[because yeah dark is yeah this is light](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h07m59s)



[on top and we get something like this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m05s)



[haste auto format okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m10s)



[now we just have to deal with this one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m17s)



[so let's see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m20s)



[this guy here is the same as great too](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m25s)



[so I think what we're gonna do is I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m28s)



[just gonna copy this guy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m31s)



[duh I think I may just duplicate this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m34s)



[guy over with the different key and this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m39s)



[is the thing the regex doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m49s)



[be perfect it just needs to save me](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m50s)



[enough time to be worth it and I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m52s)



[that it did because having to type all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m56s)



[these individually and make sure I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m58s)



[didn't make a mistake regex is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h08m59s)



[worthwhile learning especially for some](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m03s)



[of these fancy ones now there are people](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m06s)



[who know tools like VI and I've seen](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m08s)



[some absolutely amazing finger](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m12s)



[contraptions that do ridiculous things](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m16s)



[that should never work but yet they do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m20s)



[so to those of you who know VI hats off](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m24s)



[to you you are better than myself I have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m28s)



[never learned it I probably should](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m31s)



[because it looks really really cool or I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m34s)



[should say it looks really cool when you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m40s)



[can pull off those amazing edits okay so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m41s)



[that handles basting](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m46s)



[great](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m52s)



[okay so that handles all of that that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h09m57s)



[was a lot of theming library stuff let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m02s)



[take a look at the other ones so this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m06s)



[that was just all of these base ones and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m12s)



[now what we need is a list of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m15s)



[brushes because this just embeds the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m18s)



[colors from both of these and you'll](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m19s)



[notice it's got the for each of these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m24s)



[colors it looks like they've basically](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m26s)



[got what is that one two three four five](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m28s)



[six brushes so an accent bass accent two](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m31s)



[three four and a highlight and then you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m33s)



[know rinse repeat across all of these so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m38s)



[I'm guessing when we look at their](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m41s)



[template to this guy here so these are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m42s)



[all of the brushes and colors that need](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m49s)



[to go in so first of all I can say for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m52s)



[certain that these are the accent colors](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h10m56s)



[we should probably break up each of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m01s)



[these into into each of these so some of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m04s)



[these we're not going to need to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m07s)



[because the the other ones already](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m09s)



[handled it for us](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m12s)



[so it's we've already taken care of all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m13s)



[of the base colors we've taken care of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m15s)



[these guys](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m18s)



[these guys we will need to add those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m23s)



[ones aren't bad oh let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m35s)



[so let's let's just start bringing these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m41s)



[guys over so I'm gonna take this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m44s)



[template guy and once again dock them to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m45s)



[the side I'm sorry for hiding it where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m48s)



[people can't see it okay so let's do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m52s)



[this guy so back over wrong project this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h11m55s)



[guy so that's set the base theme just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m02s)



[collapse this for the moment let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m06s)



[private static void set metadata](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m11s)



[you source dictionary source dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m21s)



[to do trying to decide I don't know what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m32s)



[we're gonna pass yet so the the key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m39s)



[things that we need to pass in are these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m41s)



[guys](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m48s)



[and I don't think the showcase brush is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m52s)



[gonna be something I think that's gonna](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m55s)



[have to move because that's gonna need](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h12m58s)



[to live somewhere slightly different but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m00s)



[for some of these it should be simple so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m06s)



[source dictionary let's see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m08s)



[so we need theme name for now empty](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m14s)



[string work source dictionary we need](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m19s)



[display name again for now empty string](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m26s)



[will work source dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m29s)



[let's see theme base color scheme it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m34s)



[also string I'm guessing that's light](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m41s)



[dark so I'm thinking with some of these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m43s)



[we're probably gonna break them up and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m47s)



[set them in the appropriate other ones](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m50s)



[like this base color scheme I think I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m53s)



[gonna be setting down here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m54s)



[let's see theme color scheme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h13m56s)



[okay so let's figure out where these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m01s)



[themes come from](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m04s)



[so theme name comes from these so that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m06s)



[will come back to because both of those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m15s)



[are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m18s)



[both of those I believe are gonna have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m24s)



[to come when we set up the the color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m27s)



[brushes ah let's see base color scheme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m29s)



[so base color scheme so I'm assuming](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m33s)



[this is light dark so let's come over](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m38s)



[here and base color scheme we're gonna](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m41s)



[move you out so you come over here and I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m45s)



[think what we're going to do so we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m50s)



[gonna abuse the fact that I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m53s)



[sure](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h14m57s)



[this works because light dark or inherit](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m00s)



[and if we pass through the inherit](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m04s)



[that's probably okay I've got apparently](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m06s)



[a mismatch on my naming here so let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m12s)



[just fix these haste](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m17s)



[haste](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m22s)



[because this myth is probably going away](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m24s)



[so come back to it come back to it and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m26s)



[this one's gonna get said elsewhere okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m30s)



[next set of stuff seems showcase brush](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m32s)



[that's gonna have to come with the color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m36s)



[theme means stuff so let's let's look at](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m39s)



[these but uh so this is gonna be](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m41s)



[resource dictionary set brush and we've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m52s)



[got the showcase brush so this this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h15m57s)



[really where we're gonna have to make](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m03s)



[some decisions about how how we want to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m04s)



[map this stuff so they're using their](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m08s)



[colors accent base because again](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m12s)



[remember they've basically got just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m16s)



[these brushes right these are the these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m18s)



[are the key ones so I should say these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m21s)



[are the key colors so we need to set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m26s)



[those up accordingly](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m30s)



[haste ok so those are the those are the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m34s)



[colors and so they are they're using](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m40s)



[accent base and let's actually do this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m45s)



[let's break out this set color into a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m50s)



[to do pull you out migrate you up and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h16m58s)



[we're just gonna do this private static](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m04s)



[this resource](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m12s)



[dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m19s)



[something more akin to that I'm not sure](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m27s)



[how much value this adds but we'll see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m31s)



[and then we can just block it at all of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m34s)



[this to do to be resource dictionary dot](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m37s)



[here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m50s)



[sirs](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h17m56s)



[part of me wants to regex this out of an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m00s)



[extension method but we'll get to that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m03s)



[in a minute don't know there's not an](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m05s)



[auto code for inline method is there](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m09s)



[now we can certainly use expression](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m14s)



[bodied members okay so that gets us into](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m17s)



[there with the color view](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m21s)



[okay back to where we started so we have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m24s)



[to basically map something in our theme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m27s)



[into each of these and this is where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m30s)



[it's going to get a little weird because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m33s)



[they've got four levels of accents](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m34s)



[we don't we've got three levels of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m39s)



[primary and they don't so this is where](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m43s)



[there's there's gonna be a little bit of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m48s)



[a mismatch here and I'm not I'm not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m50s)



[entirely sure the appropriate mapping so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m54s)



[if people have a strong opinion about](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m56s)



[what this should be please tell me kind](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h18m59s)



[of wondering if this if this should be a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m08s)



[Severus](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m18s)



[I'm kind of wondering if these set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m21s)



[brushes should be good to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m23s)



[there's any reason why these can't be a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m33s)



[because this is the sets color I did to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m39s)



[do because this actually theoretically](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m42s)



[changes it to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m44s)



[right so setcolor let's do accent bass I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h19m56s)



[think is probably pretty easy](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m00s)



[because this becomes themed](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m08s)



[sorry secondary mid color right and that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m16s)



[also means that the showcase brush which](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m23s)



[was the accent base gets set the same so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m27s)



[this becomes resource dictionary set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m30s)



[brush and let's grab that showcase brush](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m38s)



[down here bring him up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m46s)



[I guess I had it right below me let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m51s)



[see new solid color brush let's see the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h20m54s)



[secondary mid color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m05s)



[okay so there's that so that handles the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m10s)



[showcase brush so it's good let's get](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m13s)



[rid of you base color scheme you're done](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m16s)



[just got those three to deal with](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m21s)



[okay so accent base is fine we need to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m23s)



[deal with the other ones now so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m28s)



[I'm actually wondering if this should be](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m37s)



[secondary dark because this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m40s)



[documentation here that shows 80% 60%](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m43s)



[40% and 20% we're not we don't have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m47s)



[those levels so I'm wondering if base](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m52s)



[should be dark and then work our way](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m55s)



[down](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h21m59s)



[so this would then become dark I think I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m08s)



[would still leave the showcase brush as](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m12s)



[the mid I think let's do accent as mid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m13s)



[because they get again we're not going](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m21s)



[to have direct correlations here and so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m23s)



[I think this is probably and then do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m26s)



[three and four is light](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m30s)



[maybe so this becomes three and this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m32s)



[becomes four and then so this becomes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m37s)



[light like that maybe I guess and then](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m40s)



[we've got the highlight color so we've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m48s)



[got to set that and to do and so the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h22m50s)



[highlight gets let's see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m01s)



[primary mid all right so that that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m06s)



[handles all the basic colors](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m12s)



[okay we've already done so here I'll](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m14s)



[bring this guy back over here for a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m18s)



[moment so this is then all of the base](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m19s)



[colors which we've already done those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m23s)



[are already populated these guys the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m25s)



[common core colors we're going to need](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m28s)



[to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m30s)



[I think we did colors fly out let's just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m31s)



[double-check that down below yep that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m34s)



[one's handled okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m39s)



[paste okay so copy paste and let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m48s)



[here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m56s)



[so these ones I think we're just hard](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m57s)



[coding I guess because they're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h23m59s)



[hard-coded in my ops so no point no](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m01s)



[point in thinking too hard on it again](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m05s)



[I'm open to suggestions if people have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m10s)



[strong opinions on what these should be](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m13s)



[C 0 X 7 X 8 7](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m16s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m28s)



[boom-boom-boom](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m33s)



[let's see sister comes two three and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m35s)



[four see if this becomes nine five nine](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m38s)



[five and nine five and this becomes zero](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h24m48s)



[zero let's let's double up two zeros](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m02s)



[just to make things line up nicely](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m04s)



[vertically no other reason zero zero](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m06s)



[zero and this is interesting these are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m11s)



[these are identical okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m16s)



[so that handles those guys clear that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m19s)



[out clear that out okay so that handles](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m23s)



[that starting here let's come back in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m30s)



[and so now we get into the more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m34s)



[interesting use case and now that we've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m36s)



[got all of those other colors that are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m39s)



[set there's all of these brushes and I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m41s)



[kind of thinking](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m48s)



[this is a great regex opportunity](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h25m54s)



[I guess I don't want to think too hard](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m00s)



[on this those ones are hard-coded](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m03s)



[yeah I'm kind of thinking I don't want](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m15s)



[to cause all of these guys in here and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m16s)



[again Rex doesn't have to be perfect it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m23s)



[just needs to be close enough and then](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m26s)



[we can hand edit the rest of them](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m30s)



[okay so copy back into our vs code paste](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m35s)



[we're just gonna start at the top we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m41s)



[might we might edit these apparently I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m43s)



[didn't grab it all you might do these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m48s)



[things in blocks so start with the first](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m52s)



[thing so let's see start of line](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m56s)



[whitespace any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h26m57s)



[replace with empty string alright so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m00s)



[we'll just unand n the universe real](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m03s)



[quick okay and so then what do we want](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m05s)



[so given all of these like let's just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m11s)



[pick on the first one right so we've got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m14s)



[this guy what we really want to do is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m16s)



[something like there's the line but it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m20s)



[gonna end up being resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m24s)



[set brush we're gonna need the key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m27s)



[because that's important right](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m32s)



[boom grab the key and then for the color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m38s)



[because set brush we've got two](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m46s)



[overloads one that takes a color I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m48s)



[what we can do is just this right so we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m50s)



[can do color and then we can actually](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m53s)



[pull it out of the resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m56s)



[using this key right because we keyed it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h27m58s)



[in previously](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m05s)



[poof done](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m08s)



[so I think that's that's the key thing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m13s)



[that we want to do is we basically just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m15s)



[want to extract out we want to turn this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m17s)



[solid color brush thing into something](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m21s)



[that looks more akin to this right](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m24s)



[okay I'm gonna dock this to the side](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m28s)



[again so I can just keep it where I can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m30s)



[see it and here we go so let's see we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m33s)



[going to match on actually we can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m36s)



[probably cheat we can probably do X key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m42s)



[equals quote and then we'll do capture](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m45s)



[set so oh grab me any character that's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m50s)



[not a quote at least one repetition](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m54s)



[something that looks like that close the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h28m59s)



[quote right so now everything inside of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m03s)



[this parenthesis is gonna be everything](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m06s)



[inside of these quotes which is what](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m09s)



[we're looking for and then what I need](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m12s)



[is this over here so we're gonna just do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m14s)



[any character any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m17s)



[but then we're gonna go until we hit](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m20s)



[color equals quote](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m22s)



[oh we got a we got to escape the curly](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m30s)



[brace static resource whitespace any](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m34s)



[number and I mean we so we don't have to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m39s)



[do that we could just do space](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m43s)



[these things are formatted well we'll](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m45s)



[just do space let's see static resource](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m47s)



[and then let's see any character at](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m49s)



[least one repetition well no we need a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m53s)



[caps group because we want to do the set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m56s)



[of all characters that are not closing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h29m59s)



[curly brace right and we want lots](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m05s)



[right and then we'll do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m16s)



[actually we can just do to the end of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m24s)



[the line right at the beginning we can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m26s)



[do boom like that okay so now the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m28s)



[question comes so this will work for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m32s)



[some of these it won't pick up all of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m35s)



[them but that's okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m38s)



[that gets us that gets us close so we're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m40s)



[gonna do resource dictionary set brush](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m43s)



[and we're gonna do dollar sign one to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m49s)



[we didn't pick up the quotes before so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m56s)



[we got to do this because the quotes are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h30m58s)



[outside of our capture group because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m01s)



[they're outside the parens so we'll put](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m03s)



[that in quotes we need to cast the thing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m06s)



[to a color and we do resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m09s)



[extract out the thing by key once again](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m13s)



[we didn't pick up the quotes because the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m17s)



[static resource won't have them but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m19s)



[capture group two and then closed paren](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m21s)



[semicolon just double check to make sure](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m27s)



[that that's right](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m30s)



[yeah so replace and let's see does that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m35s)



[look right you source dictionary set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m39s)



[brush grab the thing color dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m42s)



[great okay so that handles some of them](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m44s)



[let's see here so let's do another one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m49s)



[so this guy here rather than color gets](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m53s)



[static resource we're gonna have let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h31m57s)



[just get rid of all this stuff here so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m00s)



[this is going to be calm color equals](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m03s)



[pound and then to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m07s)



[oh I'm realizing I made a mistake on my](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m15s)



[other one because I allowed the Alpha](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m18s)



[channel to be optional go back and look](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m21s)



[at the code real quick I think that bit](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m26s)



[me on alpha channel stuff because that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m29s)



[would have meant that to do we might](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m35s)



[have to go through and spot-check some](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m41s)



[of these because I'm thinking that means](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m42s)



[that I matched on the wrong wrong](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m45s)



[capture group](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m51s)



[we'll come back and double-check it I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m56s)



[think that that that probably bit me](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h32m57s)



[okay but we'll come back so let's see so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m00s)



[color pound capture group and it looks](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m05s)



[like so we're gonna do these in two sets](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m09s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m13s)



[so once again we're going to do the same](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m15s)



[set of zero through nine a through f so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m17s)



[hex exactly two and we're going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m24s)



[repeat this set three times one two](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m28s)



[three four](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m34s)



[did that not work](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m39s)



[so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m44s)



[how many sets of these do I have I've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m48s)



[got one two three I've already got four](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m50s)



[in there so I'm already matching on four](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m55s)



[okay so that picks up all of those so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h33m58s)



[let's now replace these so these now are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m03s)



[going to be resource dictionary set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m06s)



[brush dollar sign and this is going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m08s)



[be color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m12s)



[from a RGB and then this will be let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m16s)



[see 0x](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m23s)



[dollar sign to 0x dollar sign 3 0 X](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m24s)



[dollars I'm 4 + 0 X dollar sign 5 place](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m29s)



[spot-check it looks fine and then I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m43s)



[think since we just did this set of all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m46s)



[items that contain four we should be](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m49s)



[able to now say do all the ones that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m52s)



[contain three and this becomes from RGB](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h34m55s)



[and then we just drop this set and I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m00s)



[think this is what I should have done on](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m05s)



[the last one that I messed up on so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m06s)



[we'll just have to spot check those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m07s)



[other ones and find all the ones that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m09s)



[only have three so let's see here so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m11s)



[that makes those okay let's see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m14s)



[I think I might just end up manually](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m26s)



[doing these we might we might make it we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m28s)



[might pretty these up so this guy here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m34s)



[or some of these other ones so let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m39s)



[here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m43s)



[so why did this one well this one's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m48s)



[double double curly brace did the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m51s)



[original not have two curly braces let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m55s)



[see so these ones were so these are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h35m59s)



[static resources ah these are variable](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m01s)



[replacements my apps colors slider value](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m03s)



[disabled so the question then comes](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m08s)



[where do these double curly brace values](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m10s)



[come from is this buried in here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m12s)



[somewhere](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m18s)



[so this is so these ones are also still](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m21s)



[embedded as colors so that's fine okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m24s)



[so we can go should save my other regex](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m29s)



[but whatever okay so let's see we've got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m33s)



[the the key again](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m35s)



[I've got color and then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m37s)



[just clear that back off again so I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m40s)



[looking for ding ding or I'm sorry we've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m44s)



[got to escape both of these so pick up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m47s)



[both of those curly braces](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m50s)



[let's see find the set of all items that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m52s)



[are not closing ticks](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h36m58s)



[I think that gets it pretty close and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m09s)



[this ends up being very similar again](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m11s)



[let's see here because it's color it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m16s)



[going to be resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m19s)



[let's see quote quote dollar sign to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m23s)



[place nope](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m28s)



[undo the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m33s)



[let's see dollar sign too but this needs](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m38s)



[to capture see where's the captured](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m41s)



[group end there just be the set of all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m44s)



[characters not just one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m46s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m54s)



[did today see what did we what did we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m56s)



[end up matching so this needs to get rid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h37m59s)



[of that for the moment](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m02s)



[Oh plus is on the wrong side of the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m08s)



[print Jew](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m11s)



[there we go so we get something more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m14s)



[akin to that that picks up all of those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m17s)



[great we've got some gradient stops and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m20s)



[linear gradient brushes might do those](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m23s)



[ones by hand this one here might just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m26s)



[convert that by hand I think this is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m35s)



[probably pretty good yeah it's close](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m37s)



[enough we'll do the rest of it by hand](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m41s)



[okay so again the regex doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m43s)



[be perfect it just needs to not suck and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m46s)



[make my life a little bit easier okay so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m49s)



[back up here we are going to place all](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m52s)



[of these guys out I'm gonna leave that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m57s)



[top just for the moment paste](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h38m59s)



[okay so that gets pretty close](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m05s)



[yes control background this guy should](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m10s)



[match great that guy's done format see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m13s)



[how close it gets so let's start just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m17s)



[working our way down making out these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m19s)



[guys oh is this right MA HAP's Oh](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m23s)



[brushes versus colors okay good okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m29s)



[good good good good good good good good](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m31s)



[good okay so the linear gradient brush](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m33s)



[so resource dictionary set brush this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m36s)



[one we're gonna just we're just gonna do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m43s)



[this one by hand boom and so this gets](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m45s)



[new](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m51s)



[linear gradient brush okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h39m55s)



[trying to remember the overloads start](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m00s)



[color and color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m03s)



[I think we just go with this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m10s)



[to do to do to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m17s)



[new gradients stop](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m24s)



[or actually let's see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m27s)



[start point gets new point 0.5](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m30s)



[zero](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m43s)



[and let's do let's do this in the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m45s)



[interest of my sanity let's just comment](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m47s)



[out that bit of code same with here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m51s)



[we're just going to comment this out](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h40m58s)



[just so that the rest of the code](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m01s)



[formatting works and I'm gonna come back](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m02s)



[and address those individually same](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m06s)



[thing here we're just gonna comment it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m14s)



[out that's probably worth keeping unused](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m17s)



[these are unused are they worth having](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m25s)



[don't know don't know and so we're just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m30s)



[gonna keep some of these again I'm just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m35s)



[trying to get the code formatting to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m38s)



[work correctly so that I can then just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m40s)



[come back through each of these comments](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m43s)



[and deal with them one at a time](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m44s)



[there we go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m54s)



[let's go here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h41m56s)



[to see here come down here another](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m01s)



[comment I think this gets really really](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m04s)



[close again I part of me wants to script](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m10s)



[this so that if and when there are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m13s)



[changes to this it doesn't cause me to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m16s)



[have to redo all these Reg X's but for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m19s)



[now I'm just interested in getting it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m23s)



[working okay so start point let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m25s)



[here we need end point gets new point](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m30s)



[0.5 to 1 great and then let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m36s)



[gradient stops gets you know and I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m43s)



[I can just do this now](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m48s)



[right](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m52s)



[all right you're okay with that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h42m57s)



[see gradient stops](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m01s)



[you're probably just unhappy because I'm](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m09s)



[guessing a gradient stop requires let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m12s)



[see so what's gonna need a color which](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m15s)



[will just pull out from here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m18s)



[color resource dictionary with that key](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m24s)



[and then from that color it also needs](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m37s)



[an offset which is zero okay what are](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m40s)



[you squawking about](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m44s)



[stop collection](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m51s)



[okay and let's see new gradient stop and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h43m55s)



[this is going to be very similar to this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m01s)



[copy-paste when in doubt just a little](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m07s)



[bit of editor inheritance copy we want](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m11s)



[this key here and we want the offset to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m16s)



[be one okay one linear gradient brush](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m20s)



[down let's do another one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m25s)



[it's this one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m32s)



[do this mobs brushes progress](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h44m34s)

[that they better match my apps or having](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m24s)



[them be solid color brushes so that they](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m26s)

[the right answer I don't know if there's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m45s)



[going to be one right answer but I would](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m46s)



[like to hear people's opinions on them](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m48s)



[let's see here something like that okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m52s)



[so let's see here so this is just a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h45m58s)



[resource dictionary set brush and this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m03s)



[one here is just hard coded to white](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m09s)



[that's that's fine](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m12s)



[so colors white boom okay](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m15s)



[let's see we'll just leave these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m25s)



[comments in place for now](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m26s)



[and a minimum they give me a nice anchor](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m33s)



[point for going back through the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m35s)



[template at a later point let's see here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m37s)



[so this is a resource dictionary set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m40s)



[brush](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m48s)



[and this guy here looks that colors](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m52s)



[white do clean this up because we don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h46m58s)



[need the XML comment style in here see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m05s)



[there there and see clean you up I'm not](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m10s)



[sure that comment adds any value let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m21s)



[see so this is going to be your source](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m24s)



[dictionary set color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m28s)



[I'm wondering if this set color really](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m35s)



[adds much sea](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m37s)



[wait so this is setting a key my apps](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m44s)



[colors menu shadow my apps colors menu](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m49s)



[shadow we don't need this we've already](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m52s)



[added to the resource dictionary same](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m55s)



[with this one](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h47m59s)



[ideal foreground okay those are added](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m00s)



[done no thinking involved see datagrid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m04s)



[ones let's see](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m10s)



[resource dictionary brush it is worth](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m15s)



[noting that even though that these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m20s)



[brushes are hard-coded at the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m21s)



[applications amel layer it doesn't mean](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m23s)



[that something lower down doesn't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m26s)



[override them because I'm guessing most](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m29s)



[of these brushes are probably resolved](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m31s)



[with dynamic resource which means if you](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m34s)



[declare something in your resource](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m36s)



[dictionary at a closer level to the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m38s)



[element your color will get resolved so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m39s)



[even though some of these things look](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m42s)



[hard-coded it is you you can think of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m44s)



[them like virtual members where you can](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m47s)



[override them and you can do the same](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m49s)



[thing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m51s)



[okay so then there's all this all this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m52s)



[all this all this and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m55s)



[yeah that's a lot of resources a lot a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h48m58s)



[lot of resources let's see if it works](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m03s)



[because if all of this just works that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m08s)



[would be that would be awesome](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m10s)



[Oh invalid number Oh hahaha see I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m27s)



[thought these were gonna bite me but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m33s)



[fortunately that makes it very easy for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m36s)



[us to track down because now we've got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m38s)



[compiler errors so these are just RGB](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m41s)



[not a RGB let's see so GB that worked](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m46s)



[out rather nicely now I don't have to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m54s)



[hunt all of them the compiler will just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h49m59s)



[find them for me perfect we've been](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m02s)



[better if I had converted them](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m08s)



[appropriately the first time but oh well](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m09s)



[live and learn](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m13s)



[again the regex is just there to speed](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m14s)



[you up not to be a coding tool so don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m17s)



[code with regex](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m23s)



[there's a old saying that the programmer](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m23s)



[solves the problem with regex and now he](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m29s)



[has two problems](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m31s)



[I think that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m42s)



[yeah and then we can whack this method](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m44s)



[too I guess because we never did do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m47s)



[those metadata values mmm love to deal](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m50s)



[with that because I'm not entirely sure](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m54s)



[how to object reference not set to the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h50m57s)



[instance of an object okay stop yeah](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m02s)



[yeah I got you yeah yeah yeah I get it I](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m05s)



[get it so let's deal with those metadata](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m08s)



[ones where did that file go so we've got](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m13s)



[these string values up here name display](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m18s)



[name color scheme those guys we got to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m22s)



[set those to something well some of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m28s)



[these are probably easy so let's just do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m37s)



[this again well now that we have the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m42s)



[theme I think we can do a resource](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m46s)



[dictionary to do](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m50s)



[theme name gets](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m53s)



[Eve dot I thought there was a there a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h51m59s)



[name](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m04s)



[clearly not these are all just color](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m07s)



[properties](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m14s)



[I mean the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m22s)



[so we're just gonna empty string it is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m27s)



[because I'd hate for something to rely](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m34s)



[on these and then it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m36s)



[I'm somewhat tempted to hard-code these](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m40s)



[in to to just be something like material](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m45s)



[design or something but I would hate for](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m51s)



[I'd hate to do that and then have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m53s)



[somebody actually build something based](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m56s)



[upon that string at least empty string](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h52m58s)



[is just useful enough to not blow up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m01s)



[let's see so f9 f5 we're gonna check and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m06s)



[see make sure we get all the way through](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m13s)



[this without blowing up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m16s)



[as again I do like this this naming](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m22s)



[style for brushes I don't know I don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m25s)



[know if it would work](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m30s)



[for the material design stuff as well](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m31s)



[but I do very much like this having the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m34s)



[separation like this it almost](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m36s)



[namespacing them okay so we're just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m38s)



[gonna kind of step fast I'm not actually](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m41s)



[interested in seeing this I'm mostly](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m43s)



[just interested in seeing if this thing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m45s)



[throws because it just threw in no](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m46s)



[reference last time which means I've](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m48s)



[probably done something stupid in here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m51s)



[somewhere but the most part I'm just](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m52s)



[looking to see the last executed line](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h53m55s)



[it's not a lot of opportunities for this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m06s)



[to break given all the setup in here to](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m08s)



[do to do to do to do that whoa](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m14s)



[so one of these guys probably they're](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m27s)



[broke](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m31s)



[which means I'm guessing I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m32s)



[something I thought was set is not set](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m38s)



[because it means we went to pull](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m44s)



[something out and it wasn't there](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m46s)



[we'll see what's going on here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m52s)



[because I would have thought](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h54m56s)



[to do that that would have been part of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m00s)



[the generator parameters but it could](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m04s)



[have not been see colors I deal](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m06s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m10s)



[so ideal for ground](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m16s)



[oh we missed it so](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m25s)



[default values ideal for ground so let's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m30s)



[let's just hunt this guy around](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m36s)



[so different ones in here have different](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m41s)



[ideal for grounds so most of the time](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m44s)



[it's white and given that we don't](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m51s)



[necessarily know](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h55m56s)



[yeah I'm thinking what we do here is we](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m04s)



[don't use this so I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m07s)



[rather than leveraging this I think](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m15s)



[we're gonna just ditch this](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m18s)



[so resource dictionary set color because](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m25s)



[we weren't setting it before and just in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m32s)



[case something is actually using a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m34s)



[reference to this color which seems](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m37s)



[plausible we're gonna set this here and](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m39s)



[we're gonna do theme primary mid](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m42s)



[foreground alright and then we'll do the](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m47s)



[same thing here](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m51s)



[see theme](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h56m56s)



[oh not so we want to get foreground](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m01s)



[color so the the key thing here is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m06s)



[foreground color may not be set and if](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m08s)



[it's not explicitly set it'll look up](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m11s)



[whether it should be white or black](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m13s)



[based upon the HSV brightness level of](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m15s)



[the the background color let's try that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m20s)



[that's the only one from this thing that](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m27s)



[looks like it so we're just gonna run](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m30s)



[again we might get past it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m32s)



[this way rather than having hard-coded](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m40s)



[ones for white and dark given that it's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m43s)



[already 11 p.m. for me I don't know if](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m46s)



[this is actually going to get going but](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m49s)



[I think what will probably happen is](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m50s)



[that at minimum I'm gonna at least get a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m52s)



[pull request going just just so I have](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m54s)



[something in progress and if anybody](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h57m59s)



[wants to pick it up and run with it](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m02s)



[feel free to branch off of mine and go](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m04s)



[crazy I think this is probably close](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m07s)



[maybe](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m11s)



[oh we got more problems so this one's](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m14s)



[not set okay so we we got it we got a](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m19s)



[deal with we got to deal with some stuff](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m25s)



[so I'm gonna get this checked in](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m26s)



[fix my apps and stage all changes more](https://youtu.be/u2jK6vk6nsI?t=01h58m30s)
