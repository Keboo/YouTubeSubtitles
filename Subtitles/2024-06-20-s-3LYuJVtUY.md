[progress got made and the other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h00m51s)

[maintainers on material design decided](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h00m53s)

[to go and do we'll call it a substantial](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h00m54s)

[amount of work um I think I came back to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h00m57s)

[configuration we're going to talk about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h02m41s)

[eye options how the whole system works](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h02m43s)

[it's been an area that I've answered a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h02m45s)

[lot of questions for people on recently](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h02m47s)

[has decided it wants to crash and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m02s)

[relaunch itself that's exciting but if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m04s)

[anybody is interested um this will be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m06s)

[streamed on YouTube uh if you are local](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m09s)

[to the Spokan area there is an in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m12s)

[inperson option as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m14s)

[well um at a minimum you can always](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m15s)

[register and if you miss the live event](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m18s)

[or you're watching this recording um if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m22s)

[cool um it's not posted yet but I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m38s)

[probably speaking to this one next month](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m42s)

[too because why do one talk when you can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m44s)

[do multiple talks so the devops one is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m46s)

[going to be a lot less code related um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m50s)

[and if people are interested in finding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m54s)

[these this this page has the links to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h03m56s)

[had with a colleague and he was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m08s)

[specifically wanting me to talk](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m09s)

[on uh that's unfair I know if you want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m12s)

[to drop a link to the Spokan rust group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m17s)

[feel free uh but the the devops one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m19s)

[isn't G to actually involve much related](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m22s)

[to devops and actually probably not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m25s)

[anything related to code um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m27s)

[the the devops talk is going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m30s)

[around pair programming um and how to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m33s)

[kind of effectively train people so I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m37s)

[spend a lot of time pairing with people](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m40s)

[and answering questions some days it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m43s)

[feels like that's my entire day is just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m45s)

[working with people which I definitely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m47s)

[do not mind I love it um that's kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m49s)

[what I enjoy doing the most sometimes it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m53s)

[causes stress when I feel like I'm not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m55s)

[actually getting my own tickets done but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m56s)

[that I if I could have a job where I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h04m59s)

[just spent all day like parrying and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m01s)

[teaching people it would be glorious](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m03s)

[absolutely glorious um but so in an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m06s)

[effort to kind of convey some of some of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m09s)

[that experience there is going to be a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m13s)

[talk showing up here now I think I just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m15s)

[saw an email about it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m18s)

[getting uh about getting the post done](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m21s)

[for this like an hour ago so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m24s)

[like Fresh Off The uh the presses so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m27s)

[it's not posted yet you can go to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m32s)

[Meetup site it's it's empty like there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m33s)

[no there's no upcoming events that gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m36s)

[blank but expect there to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m38s)

[announcements in this area I think it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m41s)

[going to be if I remember right you see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m44s)

[it's either like July 23rd or 30th it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m48s)

[one of those Tuesdays and oftentimes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m51s)

[these ones get done like midday so if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m53s)

[we're talking Pacific time like like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h05m57s)

[noon type](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m00s)

[situation uh so Pikachu that's actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m02s)

[one of the things that I that I am uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m07s)

[gonna talk through because I think there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m10s)

[is there's a spectrum right and you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m12s)

[don't necessarily have to know a bunch](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m15s)

[to teach people the the amount that you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m17s)

[know just limits how much you can teach](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m20s)

[right but you know something for example](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m22s)

[you know I like Mountain Dew and you can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m25s)

[teach that to others](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m27s)

[the more you know the more you can teach](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m30s)

[so it it it's a it's a sliding scale](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m33s)

[that just slowly gets better a as you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m36s)

[learn more so that that is uh so if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m38s)

[people are interested in that that one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m42s)

[will be coming up as well because we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m44s)

[talked and rather than me just doing a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m47s)

[one-on-one with my my colleague he](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m48s)

[figured hey other people might benefit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m50s)

[from this too let's just why don't you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m52s)

[just do a user group talk and I went](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m54s)

[sure why not let's just do another one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m56s)

[I'm not busy let's that that'll be fine](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h06m58s)

[that'll be fine it'll be totally fine](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m01s)

[okay so material design and EXO](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m03s)

[Milestones 51 right we're going to go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m05s)

[through and clear some of these PRS and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m07s)

[I think I'm about to just punt like we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m09s)

[punted a bunch of issues before and I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m12s)

[probably about to punt more of them but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m14s)

[some of the open um some of the open PRS](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m16s)

[I think address some of these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m20s)

[problems uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m23s)

[yeah uh let's see IE configuration and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m27s)

[generic host are some of the beasts of C](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m31s)

[that once you have a hold of you feel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m33s)

[infinitely powerful yes yes and it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m35s)

[also one that I feel like I've explained](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m38s)

[to people a lot and so it's it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m40s)

[difficult](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m44s)

[to it's difficult to capture that um oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m47s)

[and on that note on the note of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m51s)

[capturing my knowledge so I I I wanted](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m53s)

[to show this off so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m57s)

[I have this I have this repost sitting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h07m59s)

[out here and I I used to advertise this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m01s)

[to people but I I've kind of stopped](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m03s)

[advertising it and I don't know if it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m05s)

[useful okay so there's code in this repo](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m06s)

[you don't care about the code right code](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m09s)

[worthless what you care about is this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m11s)

[folder has every subtitle for every](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m17s)

[YouTube video I've put out in like the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m22s)

[last several](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m24s)

[years since like five years ago right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m25s)

[right and the cool part about these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m29s)

[markdown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m31s)

[files is they're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m33s)

[hyperlink right so if you're curious how](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m36s)

[this markdown file is generated the code](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m38s)

[for generating it is inside of there so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m40s)

[you need a book editor oh hang on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m43s)

[Pikachu we're getting there we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m45s)

[getting there so this is done by taking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m46s)

[the subtitle track from YouTube so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m49s)

[effectively video gets uploaded to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m51s)

[YouTube YouTube will do speech to text](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m53s)

[generate you a subtitle file wonderful](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m55s)

[right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h08m59s)

[I then take that subtitle file do a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h09m00s)

[little bit of uh string massaging and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h09m02s)

[PRS PRS so uh let's see this one was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m19s)

[from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m22s)

[Nikolai](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m25s)

[welcome to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m30s)

[here and sometimes I I Rabbit Trail I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m36s)

[often Rabbit Trail](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m38s)

[um yeah so this is specifically trying](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m42s)

[to address this rating bar issue that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m46s)

[in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m49s)

[the uh 51 release now I think it's in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m50s)

[the 51 release because Nikolai was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m54s)

[fixing it and then got a fix in and and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m56s)

[so figured hey I want this to make the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h11m59s)

[51 release so great totally fine by me](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m01s)

[that's why we have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m04s)

[maintainers Okay so this one here so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m06s)

[this and let me move myself to the other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m10s)

[side so that I don't get in the way of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m12s)

[this and we'll go bigger we'll go bigger](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m13s)

[and really want to collapse this sidebar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m16s)

[and it oh wait can I do that ha yes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m19s)

[that'll work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m22s)

[okay so we've got this this suppresses](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m24s)

[the empty constru](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m28s)

[RoR this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m29s)

[works my slightly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m32s)

[like and it's commented so it's fine but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m35s)

[my slight preference would be rather](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m38s)

[than doing this here I would actually do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m40s)

[this type of thing where you assign to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m44s)

[the property inside of the obsolete](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m45s)

[Constructor and do the the bang the null](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m47s)

[Bang there that way when we delete the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m50s)

[obsolete Constructor everything dies](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m52s)

[together right so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h12m55s)

[yeah and this and this is one of those](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m00s)

[cases where it doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m02s)

[it's pretty unlikely anybody is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m03s)

[instantiating](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m05s)

[this directly this is kind of a control](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m07s)

[that we instantiate as part of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m09s)

[rating bar so it's it's unlikely anyone](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m11s)

[encounters it totally fine okay let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m14s)

[see here so we've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m17s)

[got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m19s)

[uh so we are switching from relative](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m22s)

[source of find ancestor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m26s)

[uh to relative Source templated](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m29s)

[parent which should be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m33s)

[fine and I think this was oh and that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m37s)

[the entire fix oh interesting so just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m41s)

[that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m44s)

[caused hang on let me go look at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m46s)

[nikolai's comment was that was that the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m47s)

[entire](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m50s)

[virtualization although the issue is not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m51s)

[the follow the uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m52s)

[virtualization uh yeah findinding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m54s)

[failures that seem to have negative](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m58s)

[impact on performance yes binding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h13m59s)

[failures will slow down your app so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m01s)

[don't do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m09s)

[ah got it okay so it forwards the rting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m10s)

[bar instance down oh I get you I got you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m13s)

[I got you okay so it's forwarding down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m17s)

[and then it can just bind directly to it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m20s)

[because if we look at this guy yeah this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m22s)

[is in the rating bar button](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m24s)

[style got it got it got it got it so we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m27s)

[forward down the rating](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m29s)

[bar uh the rating bar button instance](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m32s)

[because these are typically created in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m35s)

[code at least inide of our control so it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m37s)

[just forwards down the rating bar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m40s)

[instance itself slaps it in here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m42s)

[obsoletes this Constructor which we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m45s)

[no longer using within the library great](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m48s)

[and then these bindings become simpler](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m51s)

[because they no longer need to Bubble Up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m53s)

[and then it addressed all the binding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m56s)

[failures love lovely perfect Nikolai](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h14m57s)

[so that clears that that clears the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h15m08s)

[issue it should have closed it so just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h15m10s)

[okay so let's go here and let's see here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h15m34s)

[uh this thing failed a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h15m38s)

[on there was no changes inside this PR](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h15m59s)

[that should have caused that failure let](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m01s)

[me just double check the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m03s)

[changes we went from VAR to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m06s)

[yeah so here's what we're going to do uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m30s)

[rerun failed yeah try that try again try](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m32s)

[again because I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m38s)

[think I don't think that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m42s)

[a a likely thing that doesn't make sense](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m46s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m52s)

[um let's come back to this one or no no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m54s)

[no this is the one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m57s)

[this one here so jorus I'm hopefully I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h16m59s)

[saying that's right this was the one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m03s)

[that we re reviewed last stream two](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m05s)

[streams ago um we went back and forth we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m07s)

[had some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m10s)

[discussion um jores had some thoughts](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m12s)

[about appropriate stuff and then did a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m15s)

[rework on this so we're going to take a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m18s)

[look at this again because I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m21s)

[think and there was to summarize the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m24s)

[discussion it basically boiled down to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m27s)

[it's really obnoxious the default WPF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m29s)

[WPF behavior and so on one hand I get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m33s)

[the desire to fix it on the other hand](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m37s)

[it's sort of yeah kind of sucky um also](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m40s)

[quick call out this is the proper way to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m45s)

[declare an enom right enom should their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m47s)

[zeroth member should typically be either](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m50s)

[default none unknown some default member](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m53s)

[because the default value of an enom is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m57s)

[always zero and so the first member will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h17m59s)

[default to the value of zero and so you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h18m03s)

[should make it be the default right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h18m04s)

[typically that means separating it from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h18m08s)

[actually putting some Investments back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m02s)

[into it again because they people were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m04s)

[concerned that it was dying and so they](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m07s)

[had to put out a very strong message](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m09s)

[saying it's not dead yet and I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m10s)

[think it's going to die until they](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m14s)

[actually produce a good zaml framework](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m16s)

[that can rival it wi ui3 I think has the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m19s)

[best shot but I don't think they've put](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m22s)

[out a good Zam framework that Rivals it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m24s)

[yet](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m27s)

[yeah they the the exact message that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m29s)

[they put out at the build conference was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m32s)

[WPF is not dead we're still investing in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m34s)

[it although when you look at the numbers](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m37s)

[they aren't investing that much it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m39s)

[very small team very small amount of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m41s)

[stuff but they are putting development](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m42s)

[behind it again um but they also said](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m45s)

[that for new projects they recommend](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m48s)

[people use wiui 3 because that's where](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m50s)

[all the new stuff is coming in and going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m52s)

[and if you use something like Maui or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m55s)

[similar like it's WI ui3 under the hood](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m56s)

[anyway so yeah I I have hope for wiui 3](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h19m59s)

[to it it looks like it will have that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m04s)

[potential and they've been working on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m06s)

[like when wi ui3 dropped I would argue](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m08s)

[it was not ready for use like there was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m11s)

[some stuff that was just so insanely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m14s)

[difficult it did not make any sense so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m16s)

[but they've started to smooth over all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m20s)

[those rough edges there's still some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m21s)

[stuff with like the debugging experience](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m23s)

[where you get these weird low-level um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m25s)

[native exceptions bubbling up with no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m28s)

[explanation um yeah and Maui it's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m31s)

[necessarily Maui's fault completely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m35s)

[because Maui is just rapping wi ui3 so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m36s)

[if wi ui3 has something sucky Maui just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m39s)

[inherits that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m42s)

[which yeah yeah Pikachu don't don't feel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m45s)

[bad Maui is of all the crossplatform](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m48s)

[Frameworks I I I would put Maui at the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m52s)

[bottom of all like and so to be clear](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m55s)

[when I say crossplatform Frameworks I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m57s)

[considering Maui Uno and avalonia I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h20m59s)

[would put Maui in third place given that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m02s)

[lineup right I have a people have asked](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m05s)

[me what I prefer I have a slight](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m07s)

[preference to avalonia over](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m10s)

[Uno but the more the more I've played](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m13s)

[with it like Uno is not bad like it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m15s)

[it's it totally good Swift](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m18s)

[UI is isn't Swift UI](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m22s)

[the I want to take a look at this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m26s)

[yeah I've SE so I don't do a lot of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m32s)

[Swift](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m35s)

[development](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m36s)

[um yeah this sort of declarative syntax](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m41s)

[this is actually something that's that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m45s)

[gained a lot of popularity recently over](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m47s)

[zaml based approaches um you'll see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m49s)

[people call it like C markup in the net](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m52s)

[World Maui went out of their way to make](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m55s)

[sure that they had an API that supported](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h21m58s)

[it um you'll see examples in Avalon and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m00s)

[Uno for doing it you can technically do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m04s)

[it in WPF it just really sucks the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m06s)

[API is not there for it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m09s)

[um but yeah this this sort of thing has](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m13s)

[been quite popular I just don't do Swift](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m15s)

[partly because I don't have a Mac and so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m18s)

[when I'm doing crossplatform stuff I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m21s)

[still build on Windows and then cross](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m23s)

[compile for the Mac with one of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m25s)

[other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m28s)

[Frameworks let's see uh might have a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m29s)

[good replacement for wiui or wiu](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m32s)

[I5](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m37s)

[yeah yeah and that's the thing is it and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m41s)

[hopefully this year Maui starts to get a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m45s)

[lot more stable if you look at what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m47s)

[they're prioritizing right now it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m48s)

[stability](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m51s)

[but it's not like they aren't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m53s)

[prioritizing a lot of new features for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m55s)

[it right now because they're trying to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m57s)

[deal with a lot of those things and to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h22m59s)

[some degree I get it right Maui](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m00s)

[struggles because they're trying to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m02s)

[all things to all people and so it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m04s)

[like they've got these Google](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m06s)

[dependencies these Apple dependencies](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m08s)

[these Microsoft dependencies and they're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m10s)

[trying to make them all work together](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m11s)

[and it's not trivial but but avalone and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m13s)

[Uno pulled it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m16s)

[off like I I only have so much sympathy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m18s)

[uh because other people are doing it so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m22s)

[yeah um and and Maui is a little like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m25s)

[they they do all have kind of the same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m29s)

[problem of you're writing in you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m31s)

[you're working in an abstraction and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m33s)

[getting three different apps out and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m35s)

[trying to make all that work it's it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m37s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m40s)

[uh let's see our final project that has](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m42s)

[to use Maui it would be the first](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m45s)

[non-example code I've interacted with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m47s)

[and I have a single week to figure it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m49s)

[all out oh boy uh if you run into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m50s)

[problems uh pinkachu you can feel free](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m54s)

[to reach out like either via like the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m56s)

[Discord stuff or whatever](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h23m58s)

[because um like we are doing Maui apps](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m00s)

[in my day job and I have I have a a a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m03s)

[bit of experience with it way back in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m06s)

[the day when they had zamaron University](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m09s)

[I was a zamaron certified mobile](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m11s)

[developer so like I jumped on that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m12s)

[bandwagon](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m15s)

[early yeah native UI has been in a tough](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m16s)

[spot for so so long and that's why I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m19s)

[think what one of the things that hasn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m20s)

[killed WPF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m22s)

[is these old ones that came out were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m24s)

[done really really well like they spent](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m27s)

[years baking before they released them](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m29s)

[and now people keep releasing UI](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m32s)

[Frameworks quickly and it's like if it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m34s)

[not really well baked it just doesn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m36s)

[stick well it doesn't stick well](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m39s)

[um M we not working on M1 M2 silicone oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m43s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m47s)

[GH](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m49s)

[yeah yeah if you haven't worked with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m51s)

[zammo prior project it can be really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m53s)

[daunting solution is watch the Stream I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m55s)

[appreciate that but yeah like zaml I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h24m58s)

[usually tell people zaml is a steep](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m02s)

[learning curve and worth it um the C UI](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m03s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m08s)

[works but like I I spent so long](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m09s)

[learning zaml I feel like I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m13s)

[significantly faster in it and that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m14s)

[probably personal bias from my own](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m16s)

[experience but I I feel like it is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m19s)

[um I I feel like I'm faster laying youu](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m23s)

[eyes out with it uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m26s)

[uh Pirates Who I consider my mentor says](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m32s)

[they have no idea how anyone class is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m36s)

[expected to get through it that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m38s)

[really tough like um when we teach at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m39s)

[the the local University I like I won't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m43s)

[say all the instructors do it but I tend](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m46s)

[to to do my own assignments because I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m48s)

[want to know how hard they are sometimes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m50s)

[I write an assignment and I think oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m52s)

[this will be easy this will be easy and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m54s)

[then I go to do it and I go man that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m57s)

[just took me four and a half hours like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h25m59s)

[if it takes me 4 and a half hours I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m01s)

[don't subject the students to it usually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m03s)

[my my bar is I have to complete my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m06s)

[assignment in an hour or less in order](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m08s)

[to give the students a week that's my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m11s)

[bar because like me who knows things or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m14s)

[at least pretends to know things if it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m18s)

[takes me more than an hour there's no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m21s)

[way a university student completes it in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m23s)

[a reasonable period of time it it just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m25s)

[gets too too daunting because they're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m27s)

[trying to learn the stuff and do it I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m30s)

[already theoretically know the stuff and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m33s)

[if it takes me that long to do it yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m35s)

[no yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m37s)

[no okay uh okay so let's see here so we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m39s)

[got what are we in scroll viewer zaml](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m43s)

[and I think this is the style or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m45s)

[template for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m47s)

[it let's take a look here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m49s)

[so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m53s)

[yes yeah this is the control template](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m55s)

[for the scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m57s)

[okay and so let's see before we had an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h26m59s)

[ignore padding false now we are setting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m01s)

[it up with a multi-trigger which](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m04s)

[conditions inside a multi-trigger are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m06s)

[anded together so both have to be true](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m08s)

[so if ignore padding is false and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m11s)

[padding mode is default then we fall](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m13s)

[into this and so this is functionally](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m16s)

[the fix that joris was looking for is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m19s)

[way to maintain the old Behavior but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m23s)

[allow people to change the way padding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m25s)

[works](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m27s)

[which is what this padding mode](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m28s)

[effectively is is he he made a very](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m29s)

[compelling argument that as long as the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m33s)

[default still fell into the old Behavior](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m36s)

[if we allowed people to change the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m39s)

[padding mode it then made the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m40s)

[padding property apply differently or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m43s)

[correctly like it it is arguable that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m47s)

[the that his proposal is the correct way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m50s)

[that padding should work because it is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m53s)

[odd that padding shrinks the scroll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m55s)

[viewer's viewport that feels wrong](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h27m58s)

[rather than than being padding around](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m00s)

[the content of the scroll viewer like I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m02s)

[I get it that makes a lot of sense okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m05s)

[and then down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m08s)

[here what are we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m10s)

[doing so same file inside the style](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m12s)

[rather than the control template we put](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m16s)

[in a multi-trigger](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m19s)

[and the trigger looks for ignore padding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m21s)

[false and then padding mode content](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m24s)

[which is the other en value and in those](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m27s)

[cases it sets the content template and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m30s)

[implements the same behavior as he had](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m32s)

[before beautiful okay so the only thing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m34s)

[I want to do is look at the usages of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m38s)

[ignore padding um because I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m39s)

[that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m42s)

[uh o posted a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m44s)

[wireframe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m47s)

[o um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m53s)

[sorry I want to I want to move this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h28m58s)

[over I'm curious let's take a look R](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m01s)

[connect](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m05s)

[updating refresh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m08s)

[button that's interesting I you said](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m12s)

[wireframe so I assume the this is just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m15s)

[the layout not the actual UI employee](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m17s)

[list add](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m20s)

[new ooh paging controls](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m24s)

[and then you've got Master detail on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m28s)

[here oo light dark toggle sound toggle](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m33s)

[text](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m38s)

[size oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m40s)

[man is a is this like um yeah Tech size](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m45s)

[that'll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m51s)

[be yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m54s)

[this is greater than four hours yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h29m58s)

[there there's a lot here it's is this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m01s)

[expected to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m05s)

[so though it doesn't look like all all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m07s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m10s)

[things well hold on let me look what do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m11s)

[we got here is we've got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m14s)

[home is that home](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m16s)

[list uh bookmark user settings so I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m19s)

[guessing this is your settings page that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m23s)

[maps from this button here not entirely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m25s)

[clear what the refresh button is for on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m28s)

[settings or on the search page these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m31s)

[this button confuses me I'm assuming](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m35s)

[it's a button maybe it's an icon it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m37s)

[just that this is the refresh reload](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m39s)

[icon so it looks a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m40s)

[funny](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m45s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m48s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m52s)

[updating it's interesting this update](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m55s)

[ating is is really shocking because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h30m58s)

[typically in a a mobile app when you see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m00s)

[an updating screen like this it's for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m02s)

[downloading additional content like when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m04s)

[like a lot of mobile games do this right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m07s)

[there's your main application package](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m09s)

[but then you can have data packages that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m12s)

[get downloaded um when like the app is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m14s)

[launched or the user hits particular](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m16s)

[places in it that way the app size is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m18s)

[kept small for initial install but can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m21s)

[grow based on the user base right it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m23s)

[for the employee DB](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m28s)

[refresh oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m31s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m36s)

[interesting seems weird that you would](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m39s)

[need it but okay great I assume this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m41s)

[just a sqlite database on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m44s)

[mobile](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m46s)

[um some of these buttons and icons and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m48s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m52s)

[is like this style of icon is very much](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h31m55s)

[iOS](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m00s)

[um like if this was a cross-platform UI](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m02s)

[i' but again you said wireframe so I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m05s)

[going to assume this isn't dictating the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m07s)

[UI as much as functionality the fact](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m08s)

[that there's like a paging control here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m11s)

[is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m14s)

[interesting and kind of surprising](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m16s)

[because paging is not trivial to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m19s)

[implement correctly like paging alone is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m21s)

[hard it's also a little weird because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m24s)

[like the list Fe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m27s)

[supports um Dynamic](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m28s)

[loading which in my opinion is just as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m31s)

[easy to implement as these buttons but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m34s)

[whatever um yeah and then you have an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m36s)

[edit and a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m40s)

[save yeah yeah no and wireframes are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m41s)

[totally F like this this is totally fine](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m45s)

[because in general wireframes are just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m48s)

[designed to show kind of layout and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m50s)

[interaction not not to dictate UI right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m53s)

[because if if I was was looking at these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m56s)

[and somebody said wireframe I would go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h32m58s)

[great this is here like there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m00s)

[um Joshua plug your yours um like there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m04s)

[there's things like this that are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m08s)

[where's the screenshots that do wire](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m12s)

[framing like this to that are it's kind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m14s)

[of like back of the napkin drawing right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m16s)

[to be very clear this is to show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m18s)

[interaction not to dictate UI because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m20s)

[some developers they get something like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m23s)

[this and they go ah I must make the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m25s)

[pixels match and they get wrapped up in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m26s)

[that but yeah this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m29s)

[is I made this in cam okay yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m33s)

[yeah yeah so like this is good but this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m37s)

[is this is a chunk of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m41s)

[work I'm also curious what the sound](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m44s)

[thing is because it doesn't look like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m46s)

[there's a lot of sound built into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m49s)

[this yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m55s)

[um especially if you're struggling to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h33m58s)

[get it done what what I would probably](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m00s)

[prioritize doing is attacking this kind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m03s)

[of one very simple screen at a time this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m07s)

[list](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m09s)

[screen um and then showing the details](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m10s)

[when you tap on one which I assume is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m13s)

[what happens when you you hit one of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m15s)

[these things right I tap on John Smith I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m16s)

[I get to see the employee details I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m20s)

[would I would focus on getting that much](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m22s)

[of the interaction in and done](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m24s)

[um and then prioritize these features](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m28s)

[one at a time cuz like I agree with the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m29s)

[comments in the chat this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m31s)

[is if you're doing this on your own in a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m33s)

[week that's that especially for somebody](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m38s)

[who is new to Maui this is a chunk of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m43s)

[work this is a decent chunk of work to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m46s)

[get this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m48s)

[in yeah never made a Mau at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m50s)

[before a week's ambitious very ambitious](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h34m53s)

[um yeah if you run into questions with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m04s)

[so a couple things that I'll point you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m08s)

[to as well uh let's see net](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m10s)

[Maui you mean so there's a few things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m14s)

[there's a few things that if you if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m17s)

[grock these Concepts they will make your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m19s)

[life significantly easier so for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m21s)

[example this one here so your light Dark](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m25s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m29s)

[stuffff if you L if you do it correctly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m30s)

[your world is easy like you could Brute](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m33s)

[Force this right like on the toggle](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m35s)

[change you could go through and do a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m37s)

[bunch of work to change all your colors](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m39s)

[that's the Brute Force approach and an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m42s)

[app on this size you could totally do it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m44s)

[and get away with it it will make your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m45s)

[life](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m48s)

[easier um if you go through and do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m49s)

[themes so specifically exactly what this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m52s)

[thing is calling out where it says okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m56s)

[you make a resource dictionary you name](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m58s)

[it light theme you make a resource](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h35m59s)

[dictionary you name it dark theme in in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m01s)

[your case these colors are whatever](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m04s)

[colors you care to have defined they've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m06s)

[used naming that follows material design](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m09s)

[in this but like you're talking like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m11s)

[page background right that's that's one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m14s)

[theme color that I see um text color is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m17s)

[another one that I see um yeah hello](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m21s)

[world tutorials yeah it it definitely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m25s)

[and the tooling doesn't make your life](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m28s)

[any any favors but then you have like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m30s)

[second uh you've got like primary](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m33s)

[foreground which is your red and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m35s)

[like secondary which is your in this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m37s)

[case light orange here and those ones](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m40s)

[may be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m42s)

[consistent I'd I'd probably have to look](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m43s)

[closer it looks like the red may be a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m45s)

[little darker in light theme a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m47s)

[lighter in the dark theme](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m48s)

[regardless declare out colors for each](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m50s)

[of the things that you're looking to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m53s)

[but then once you have these two](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m55s)

[resource dictionaries](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m57s)

[declared uh the Style guy two oranges](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h36m59s)

[and one red okay perfect yeah but give](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m02s)

[them a name give them colors for your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m05s)

[light inth dark and and even things that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m07s)

[are the same I I often times will still](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m09s)

[declare all my colors here and if it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m12s)

[like the same color on both light and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m14s)

[dark no biggie that's fine it just means](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m16s)

[if you ever wanted it them to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m18s)

[different later you could then you pick](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m19s)

[your default resource theme here so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m22s)

[whatever you want the app to start in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m24s)

[light or dark mode because it has to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m25s)

[start in some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m27s)

[mode and then down a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m28s)

[further uh you can do something like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m32s)

[this when it comes time to swap between](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m35s)

[themes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m38s)

[right and then inside of all of your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m41s)

[zaml the key thing to do is make sure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m44s)

[that when you're referencing one of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m47s)

[those theme colors you use the the word](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m48s)

[dynamic resource if you use static](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m51s)

[resource it won't change if you use](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m54s)

[Dynamic resource then when you swap](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m57s)

[those resource dictionaries out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h37m59s)

[everything updates right so if you lay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m01s)

[it out this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m04s)

[way it'll it'll make it'll make this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m05s)

[checkbox or or toggle switch a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m09s)

[breeze right this one it makes this very](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m12s)

[easy now you can also do something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m16s)

[similar because you'll note up here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m18s)

[there's nothing requiring that the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m22s)

[things in this resource dictionary be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m25s)

[you can put whatever you want in these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m28s)

[resource](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m30s)

[dictionaries right so you could put your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m31s)

[font sizes in here as well I probably](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m34s)

[wouldn't because you want your font](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m37s)

[sizes changing based upon this but the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m39s)

[same principle for doing font changes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m42s)

[could](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m45s)

[apply um here as well right you could](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m46s)

[have three resource dictionaries you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m49s)

[know small medium](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m51s)

[large swap out the resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m54s)

[right you'll have to be careful that you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m58s)

[don't like if you're swapping for theme](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h38m59s)

[and for font size you'll have to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m01s)

[careful that you know cuz this is just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m03s)

[blindly clearing everything maybe don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m05s)

[blindly clear everything maybe be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m08s)

[slightly more intelligent about what you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m09s)

[clear um or what you re but as long as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m11s)

[you make sure you add in a font size](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m15s)

[resource dictionary you could have a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m17s)

[different resource dictionary for small](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m19s)

[medium and large fonts and store all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m21s)

[relevant things in there maybe that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m23s)

[resource dictionary just contains a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m25s)

[single size but the key thing here is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m26s)

[then if you reference your font size](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m30s)

[with a dynamic resource then as you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m31s)

[change the font size the rest of your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m34s)

[app just updates and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m36s)

[responds so that's the kicker Dynamic](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m38s)

[resource on anything that you want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m41s)

[change at runtime static resource on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m43s)

[everything else because Dynamic resource](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m45s)

[is more expensive than uh static](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m49s)

[resource so typically styles are going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m52s)

[to be static resources because your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m54s)

[style doesn't change typically at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m56s)

[runtime but your colors or your font](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h39m58s)

[size is bite so those would be dynamic](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m01s)

[resource so something akin to that would](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m03s)

[do it and then I would like I said I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m06s)

[would it it like it's probably too early](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m09s)

[to say damage control but I would I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m12s)

[would probably start with the list and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m15s)

[the details and and then probably do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m18s)

[save edit next and then back up and try](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m21s)

[some of these other like searches the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m24s)

[main M loading screen that kind of stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m27s)

[because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m29s)

[that's these are going to these are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m30s)

[deceptively like this screen is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m33s)

[deceptively difficult for how little is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m35s)

[on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m37s)

[it uh yeah it's 110% damage control mode](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m39s)

[yeah so I would just in terms of like if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m42s)

[I was putting this app together to to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m46s)

[try to like demo something for a client](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m48s)

[and I was worried about not having](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m50s)

[things done in time I would focus like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m51s)

[my primary thing is this looks like a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m54s)

[like an employee management typee](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m57s)

[situation right the mo I would then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h40m59s)

[start prioritizing features most](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m01s)

[important feature is being able to show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m03s)

[a list right next most important feature](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m05s)

[is being able to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m08s)

[display a a thing the add new and the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m10s)

[edit are probably going to be very](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m14s)

[similar because typically those are the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m16s)

[same uis one's just pre-populated so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m18s)

[after getting list in details I might do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m21s)

[add new](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m23s)

[next um I do find it interesting I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m24s)

[noticing there's no delete but maybe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m26s)

[that doesn't matter eh who cares about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m28s)

[deleting we don't fire employees here um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m30s)

[but then but then basically just start](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m33s)

[prioritizing features like I wouldn't do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m36s)

[the paging first I'd have this be a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m38s)

[straight list view just get them all in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m41s)

[the list tap on the list get into the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m43s)

[details get those displayed properly and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m45s)

[then work on on adding in the additional](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m48s)

[bits of functionality cuz once you get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m50s)

[the the first couple going you'll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m53s)

[probably notice things start to get a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m55s)

[little bit easier but inevitably what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m56s)

[happens is you you're going to get on to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h41m59s)

[one of the features and something's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m01s)

[going to work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m03s)

[right right something that should be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m04s)

[easy there's a typo somewhere especially](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m06s)

[when it gets to crunch time that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m09s)

[inevitably always happens whenever](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m12s)

[you're in crunch time you make more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m13s)

[mistakes and so just be prepared for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m15s)

[that yeah I would I would start list](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m19s)

[details and then probably add new and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m22s)

[then work from there and and see what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m24s)

[time is remaining cuz honestly just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m25s)

[those within a week I think is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m28s)

[probably a week especially for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m31s)

[somebody brand](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m34s)

[new okay I wanted to look at this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m36s)

[3579 uh this is bellac we're going here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m39s)

[one week much coffee was nice knowing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m42s)

[you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m44s)

[all well again like I said I if if I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m46s)

[from my perspective when I was a student](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m49s)

[going through and doing this I I'd be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m51s)

[looking for what can I do that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m53s)

[that at least lets me turn in something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h42m58s)

[that I that I'm proud of for the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m00s)

[assignment](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m02s)

[right rather than getting some things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m03s)

[part of the way it's usually better to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m07s)

[do fewer things well than a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m10s)

[things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m13s)

[poorly my perspective](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m16s)

[like because if you've got a few things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m19s)

[that work well you've got something to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m21s)

[show if you've got a bunch of things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m23s)

[that don't work you have to kind of like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m25s)

[like to like talk around it and you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m28s)

[don't have as much to show it's much](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m30s)

[easier to say hey I didn't get all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m31s)

[features done but here's the three that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m32s)

[I did do and these ones](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m34s)

[work okay at least you got three that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m36s)

[are in and working especially if the uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m39s)

[instructor gives partial credit or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m43s)

[similar much easier to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m44s)

[that and typically at least my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m50s)

[experience is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m53s)

[most um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m55s)

[it's crud always wondered why it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h43m59s)

[not Arad as that's how you you right at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m01s)

[all I mean you're not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m07s)

[wrong uh I have to assume the final end](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m10s)

[of uh Sprint uh meeting is expecting me](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m14s)

[to fall short but still yeah it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m17s)

[possible is this a a team project or a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m20s)

[solo one that you're doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m23s)

[I want to just look at the usages of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m29s)

[ignore padding because I think the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m30s)

[changes solo project ouch](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m32s)

[ouch yeah that is that is a lot for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m36s)

[a okay good I just I I just wanted to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m43s)

[check the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m46s)

[usages because that subtle switch on the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m48s)

[default for ignore padding gives me a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m52s)

[bit of pause](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m54s)

[because these are all switching them to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h44m57s)

[true and this is sitting on false and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m01s)

[think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m05s)

[okay yeah I think this switch is correct](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m08s)

[okay good good good good good good this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m11s)

[looks](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m14s)

[great okay so we're going to approve](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m15s)

[it uh looks great uh thank you for the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m19s)

[rework](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h45m26s)

[okay so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m03s)

[that Sprint](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m07s)

[planing is just a wet finger in the air](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m09s)

[of if all the Ducks line up and I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m12s)

[have a dodgy scope on my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m14s)

[Cannon I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m19s)

[mean yes this has actually been a a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m21s)

[longstanding debate because I work for a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m25s)

[consulting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m28s)

[company and every every client basically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m29s)

[wants to know the same thing is how long](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m33s)

[is it going to take and how much is it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m36s)

[going to cost right like that's the they](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m37s)

[ask the question in lots of different](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m40s)

[ways but really at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m42s)

[that's what they want to know and with a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m45s)

[lot of agile based projects that's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m48s)

[an easy answer to give because it's okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m51s)

[we'll do this much we'll see what we've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m54s)

[learned and then we'll do the next step](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m56s)

[we'll do this much then the next step](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m57s)

[this much and the next step and there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h46m59s)

[there's a tension there between](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m02s)

[providing guesstimates right you because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m05s)

[they're far enough out they're blind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m09s)

[guesses at times because it's like I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m11s)

[don't know we we don't have enough](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m13s)

[information to give a good accurate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m14s)

[estimate of how long this is going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m17s)

[take so yeah Sprint end is this is how](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m18s)

[that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m38s)

[okay all checks line up good okay so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m40s)

[this thing just needed to rerun test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m44s)

[that concerns me that there's a test out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m46s)

[there that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m48s)

[flaky so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m49s)

[that that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m52s)

[uh mildly interesting okay okay so let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m54s)

[see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h47m57s)

[that's fine that's fine so the whole](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m17s)

[idea here is um the author started](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m20s)

[moving a lot of the shared code because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m23s)

[we have two demo projects material](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m25s)

[design two material design three and so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m27s)

[just some of the common stuff like the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m30s)

[the value converters just threw them in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m31s)

[a shared project reference them which I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m34s)

[think is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m36s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m37s)

[right I have high hopes of because these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m39s)

[just all got moved all got moved I had](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m42s)

[some feedback on the on the shared](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m45s)

[project because there was a few things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h48m48s)

[in but like the facilitator then has the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m22s)

[ability to like show or hide the votes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m25s)

[once everybody's voted and then it can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m28s)

[automatically reveal votes when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m30s)

[everybody does it and it's just it was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m32s)

[it was a fun little exercise with Blazer](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m34s)

[and Signal R and all kinds of stuff to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m36s)

[just throw something out you can find a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m38s)

[couple streams on my YouTube where I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m40s)

[worked on this if you just search for uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m42s)

[you're ready you hit reset votes and you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m55s)

[move on to talking about the next ticket](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h50m57s)

[and apparently my there's some clock](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m00s)

[drift issues which is exciting that my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m03s)

[clock is apparently off by like 30](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m05s)

[seconds from the server so that's fun](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m08s)

[oops clock drift is hard this this time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m12s)

[wasn't a real big deal it's basically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m15s)

[just keeping track of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m18s)

[um how long the team's been discussing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m21s)

[something because this was this was kind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m24s)

[of like a passion project for one of our](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m26s)

[um project managers who was annoyed that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m29s)

[all the free ones online either were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m32s)

[loaded with ads or had constant downtime](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m33s)

[and didn't work consistently and all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m37s)

[that stuff so I was like I I I could](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m39s)

[build one of these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m42s)

[um oh this reminds me you get free QA if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m45s)

[you get your co-workers to use](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m49s)

[something something I learned from this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m51s)

[app correct this this app was very much](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m54s)

[a test in production right so like I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h51m57s)

[preview the votes and see it and but and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m00s)

[there's no security right like and I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m02s)

[see when everybody's voted poof okay you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m04s)

[know Pikachu voted three is he voted 13](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m07s)

[discuss you know maybe we compromise and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m11s)

[come down to an eight or something right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m13s)

[or a five or whatever and then we go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m14s)

[back and forth and it's it's a very](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m17s)

[simple app and then if you know I decide](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m19s)

[that you know Izzy walked away from his](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m21s)

[computer and left his browser open](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m23s)

[because that you know people do that and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m25s)

[because this thing doesn't have off I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m28s)

[can't kick somebody from a room because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m29s)

[the connections are all based upon their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m31s)

[browser being open on Signal R you can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m33s)

[take this and you can punt somebody down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m35s)

[to the Observer R if you want to do it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m37s)

[so you can't kick them from a room](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m39s)

[because as long as they're browsers](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m40s)

[there it's going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m42s)

[reconnect which is annoying so I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m43s)

[kick the connection but the browser will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m45s)

[just make a new one and because there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m47s)

[no off it's like brand new user way to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m48s)

[go it's like yuck that didn't work but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m50s)

[you can punt them down to observers so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m53s)

[that they don't affect your votes and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m54s)

[whatnot so yeah if anybody wants to use](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m55s)

[it you are welcome to it is free it is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h52m58s)

[open source I host it on my Azure uh I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m01s)

[think it costs like three cents a month](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m05s)

[to operate it's Dirt](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m07s)

[Cheap so it is a beautiful example of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m10s)

[build and ship all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m14s)

[things so yeah but yeah if anybody wants](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m16s)

[to use it knock yourself out and if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m19s)

[find bugs open issues or send pull](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m21s)

[requests if you don't like something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m23s)

[okay here we are so this one here was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m25s)

[specifically and I think this was one of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m28s)

[the last ones for the 51 uh there was a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m30s)

[request to add additional overloads to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m33s)

[show dialogue with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m35s)

[identifier](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m37s)

[um let's see create an overload method](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m39s)

[that accepts a string identifier exactly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m42s)

[as is in dialog H show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m45s)

[dialogue it would be nice to Define an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m51s)

[identifier](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m54s)

[uh yeah so this was this was bringing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h53m58s)

[in and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m04s)

[then uh Michael asked uh if this was to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m05s)

[confirm the functionality that was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m09s)

[needed great I think oh did we not merge](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m11s)

[this shared Library one oh right I was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m15s)

[checking because I was confused](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m18s)

[why yeah implicit usings isn't on at the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m21s)

[root I don't know why](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m24s)

[this is this code is fine approve and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m27s)

[run](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m31s)

[bother me at all and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m54s)

[to be able to ship](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h54m58s)

[stuff um so one if if you're interested](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m00s)

[in the the sum total of the the pipeline](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m04s)

[uh net build net](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m08s)

[test uh I do some code coverage stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m10s)

[because I wanted to report those things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m13s)

[one that was a real as you can see I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m27s)

[also have dependabot Auto pushing chain](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m29s)

[whatever dependabot can exist um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m31s)

[dependabot opens a lot of PRS but this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m34s)

[doing this code coverage comment](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m37s)

[directly on the pr this is actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m39s)

[something that takes two workflows to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m43s)

[properly and not accidentally expose](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m46s)

[things which is important if you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m48s)

[working in a public open source repo so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m50s)

[it it generates the report but to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m53s)

[actually take that report post it as a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m55s)

[comment you don't want your PR Pipeline](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h55m57s)

[with right access into your repository](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m00s)

[because that will bite you in an open](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m03s)

[source situation so it writes this stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m05s)

[out uploads it as an artifact and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m08s)

[this guy kicks off based upon when the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m11s)

[other one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m14s)

[finishes pulls down the artifact and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m15s)

[pushes it up but this is the one that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m18s)

[actually has right access with a a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m19s)

[special token right so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h56m22s)

[bad like you gotta fix the actual](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m21s)

[problem okay so this adds some overloads](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m23s)

[so specifically this is the show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m27s)

[dialogue extension on window um this one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m29s)

[dialogue before it was just taking in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m46s)

[window and doing this and so now it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m48s)

[would have to follow up see random](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h58m51s)

[um if you want easy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h59m49s)

[mode this is actually the easiest way to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h59m52s)

[to do it in my opinion right so this one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=00h59m56s)

[here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m01s)

[um and it it it does depend on whether](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m02s)

[you want to do a user organizational one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m05s)

[or you want it Project based right so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m07s)

[the there are options but this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m10s)

[probably the easiest it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m14s)

[um it's based on so it is a very simple](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m17s)

[mode way of doing it but you you set up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m20s)

[a GitHub](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m25s)

[with a particular](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m26s)

[name you enable GitHub pages on it you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m28s)

[pick a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m32s)

[theme and then you just upload markdown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m33s)

[files and that's it right you write your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m36s)

[blogs in markdown you get a bunch of of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h00m39s)

[markdown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m07s)

[docks](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m09s)

[ones do it where they where they do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m21s)

[static site](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m23s)

[generation right right because the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m24s)

[hard part is if you just upload markdown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m26s)

[docs at some point something has to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m29s)

[conversion from markdown into HTML at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m31s)

[the end of the day that's what it has to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m34s)

[do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m36s)

[um yeah so the let me see there is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m38s)

[a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m43s)

[yeah yeah so there are a bunch and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m48s)

[you'll note](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m50s)

[um here here here's these ones](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m53s)

[this one here will give you the theme](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m56s)

[pages and it does come down to there are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h01m59s)

[there's a lot more options available to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m04s)

[you if you want to do your own hosting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m06s)

[as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m08s)

[well um so there there is there is that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m10s)

[kind of thing by doing GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m13s)

[GitHub takes care of the hosting you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m16s)

[don't have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m18s)

[to but I don't like it so I'm not sure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m20s)

[why I'm recommending it yeah that's a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m22s)

[that that's a very fair question](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m24s)

[um if you're willing to host your own](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m26s)

[stuff and there's there's also like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m29s)

[hosting providers out there that will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m31s)

[usually do the static site hostings for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m32s)

[cheap or free because it is stupid easy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m35s)

[to do and stupid cheap um if you want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m39s)

[host yourself and deal with that kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m41s)

[thing you've got a lot more options](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m44s)

[available to you but GitHub pages is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m47s)

[probably the easiest thing to get up and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m48s)

[going I did one for myself I think it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m50s)

[took me 15 minutes and it was only](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m53s)

[because I hadn't done it before and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m56s)

[was reading the docs um Azure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h02m57s)

[Freer](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m02s)

[the um if you do decide to go selfhosted](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m04s)

[if I might plug an option for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m10s)

[you um you can technically host there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m13s)

[where is the where is the uh SE all free](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m17s)

[services uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m21s)

[so the app service but there was the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m28s)

[Azure what is the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m30s)

[static where is it where is it the Azure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m36s)

[static hosting stuff is dirt cheap or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m39s)

[free I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m43s)

[thought static web apps yeah there we go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m45s)

[so an Azure static web app on the free](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m48s)

[tier gives you a 100 gigs of bandwidth](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m51s)

[you know how hard it is to hit a 100](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m55s)

[gigs of bandwidth serving up a static](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m57s)

[site you have to like load it up with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h03m59s)

[big images or something to to do that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m01s)

[two custom domains and uh 500 Meg of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m04s)

[storage per](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m08s)

[app you could do a lot of blogging in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m11s)

[that and then if you look at the pricing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m15s)

[for Azure static web apps beyond that so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m17s)

[if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m20s)

[outgrow the uh the free tier](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m21s)

[the pricing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m25s)

[is yeah you'll you'll note you'll note](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m27s)

[the the dollar sign is like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m30s)

[insane it's it's really really hard](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m33s)

[so um so if you do need to upgrade into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m37s)

[the the higher](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m40s)

[tier](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m43s)

[uh you so you do get the 100 gigs and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m45s)

[then they charge 20 cents per gig after](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m48s)

[more custom domains free SSL Sears](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m51s)

[uh included storage Enterprise grade](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m56s)

[Edge if you want to like all that stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h04m59s)

[so if you do want a static host and you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m02s)

[and you have a static site generator](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m05s)

[it's a lot of the static site generators](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m07s)

[what happens is you stand up a GitHub](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m09s)

[repository a GitHub action that takes in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m11s)

[your markdown or similar does the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m14s)

[generation and just pushes the output of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m16s)

[that into an Azure static web](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m19s)

[app so you then then and then the sky](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m22s)

[the limit once you have it hosted there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m25s)

[then then you're free to go but again](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m27s)

[that's extra steps that you need to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m29s)

[yeah I might do that one making my own](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m32s)

[blog from scratch going to use blazer](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m34s)

[for it in the future yeah and there's um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m35s)

[I think I remember seeing a couple](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m38s)

[blogging engines actually built out in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m40s)

[for my company yeah it's very common](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m48s)

[that that's the pattern and especially](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m50s)

[if you want if you if you're willing to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m52s)

[go down that route of setting up your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m54s)

[own GitHub action and push into your own](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m55s)

[custom host like there's so many options](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h05m57s)

[out there pick your favorite uh well](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m02s)

[brings in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m24s)

[kind of want to look at the code right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m26s)

[above this because I have a strange](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m28s)

[with the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m33s)

[comes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m38s)

[in the only thing I'm not sure I like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m42s)

[about this is if you pass in a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m45s)

[null I guess if you pass it a null it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m51s)

[doesn't make s if you pass in a null it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m54s)

[shouldn't match on the yeah I guess](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h06m57s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m00s)

[correct uh Additionally the build](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m01s)

[process for markdown sites is next to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m03s)

[nothing yeah it's like I think it takes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m05s)

[longer for the GitHub action to like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m08s)

[spin up the runner than it does to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m10s)

[actually execute in most cases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m12s)

[insane](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m19s)

[yeah let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m22s)

[see yeah this looks](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m24s)

[nice yeah and you'll find that there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m28s)

[um there's the built-in ones that GitHub](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m31s)

[actions has kind of in the box but there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m33s)

[is a huge number of like Community ones](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h07m35s)

[stream next week Casey I believe he's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m07s)

[very familiar with markdown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m09s)

[parsers I think we're planning on using](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m12s)

[one for our make me into a bot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m14s)

[feature oh I actually want to make your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m18s)

[own markdown parser with C cool so as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m20s)

[long as you're making it because you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m25s)

[want the learning opportunity if you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m26s)

[trying to do something quick there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m28s)

[good libraries out there but for people](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m30s)

[but some people learn best by doing and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m32s)

[so if it's if it's partially for that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m34s)

[yeah go for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m37s)

[it yeah I don't know if we're actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m40s)

[going to do a deep dive on markdown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m42s)

[parsing so here I showed it earlier but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m44s)

[I'll show it again real quick there is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m47s)

[I've got a repo that sits out here that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m49s)

[most people don't know exists because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m51s)

[and and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m55s)

[yeah if we look at the commits you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m56s)

[you'll you'll note that there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h08m58s)

[just bot commits and specifically this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m00s)

[subtitles thing contains markdown with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m03s)

[the subtitles of every stream I've done](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m06s)

[in the last five](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m08s)

[years um and so what we are looking to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m10s)

[do is basically build a chat GPT style](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m13s)

[clone of me using this as its source](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m16s)

[data to ground it in so that it can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m19s)

[answer questions as me because I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m22s)

[spent a lot of time answering questions](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m25s)

[here so there's I'd like to say a wealth](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m27s)

[of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m30s)

[knowledge](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m31s)

[um yeah so yeah the the how come back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m34s)

[next week and it may it may span a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m38s)

[couple streams we'll see the last time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m41s)

[we did an AI stream we built a a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m43s)

[a little app that what was it we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m46s)

[recorded a chunk of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m48s)

[audio trying to remember exactly what we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m51s)

[did with it we recorded a chunk of audio](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m53s)

[and then we did like speech to text on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m55s)

[it and we were done in like 45 minutes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h09m57s)

[we're like oh that was a little too easy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m00s)

[so this one will this one might take a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m04s)

[little bit longer because we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m06s)

[have to we'll have to like dive into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m07s)

[some AI topics like factorization rag](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m09s)

[retrieval a bed generation and some of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m13s)

[those types of things but it's it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m16s)

[actually not terribly difficult to build](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m19s)

[like one of those chatbot style things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m21s)

[it's actually stupid easy like insanely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m24s)

[easy so we may we may do one of these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m28s)

[and then we we'll see how useful it gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m33s)

[because I I told them like my my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m35s)

[long-term dream would be and and I I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m37s)

[contemplated building this but I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m40s)

[scared to build it because I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m41s)

[willing to bet GitHub builds it at some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m44s)

[point is I would like something like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m45s)

[when you go to log an issue](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m47s)

[right GitHub will uh get started right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m49s)

[GitHub will try](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m53s)

[to to check and see if there's existing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m56s)

[items out there that match what you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h10m59s)

[writing right let's see add dialog host](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m01s)

[identifier right oh and this one is this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m08s)

[one even turns off some of that that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m11s)

[even worse but what I would really love](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m13s)

[what I would really love is a bot that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m15s)

[watches new issues coming](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m17s)

[in scans prior issues scans my stuff and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m19s)

[and leaves comments on there going hey I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m25s)

[see you're having this issue here's some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m27s)

[possible solutions right it not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m28s)

[issue and I don't have to do it that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m40s)

[sounds a because a lot of times there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m43s)

[answered or similar things coming](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m46s)

[through and it feels like I could make a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m48s)

[bot to do that or at least a bot to help](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m51s)

[right I don't want it in the driver seat](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h11m53s)

[initially we're just going to make a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h12m06s)

[little app that we can chat with and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h12m08s)

[have it talk like me which sounds](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h12m09s)

[utterly terrifying but hey why](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h12m12s)

[came up with I was like you know there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h13m35s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h13m40s)

[like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h13m42s)

[um for people uh what is it hang on I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h13m44s)

[basically crowdsourcing audio](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h14m02s)

[books so I will point out quality varies](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h14m06s)

[quite a bit right these are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h14m10s)

[volunteers recording books that are in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h14m13s)

[let's see here uh this is the service](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h28m53s)

[defaults there we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h28m57s)

[go Okay add database oh did I not do it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m00s)

[a dirty trick](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m25s)

[here yeah a worker service that that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m26s)

[the better way of doing it because this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m30s)

[here is kind of kind of dirty so the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m32s)

[reason they recommend a worker service](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m35s)

[rather than just doing it straight up in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m37s)

[my startup is this is going to hang](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m39s)

[startup while the database is being](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m41s)

[upgraded right like but I only do this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m45s)

[in development so this is only local](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m48s)

[development I don't care if my startup](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m50s)

[time suffers](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h29m52s)

[couple things that happen is one I uh as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m10s)

[part of my build pipeline I produce an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m14s)

[EF migration bundle so this is a an exie](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m17s)

[that basically Tak takes your EF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m22s)

[migrations and that migrate async](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m25s)

[bundles it into a standalone console app](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m27s)

[that I then uh upload as an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m30s)

[artifact and then a little further down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m34s)

[I actually have database migrations as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m37s)

[one of the steps in my pipeline so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m41s)

[before I deploy out to the environment I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m42s)

[pull down that that little command line](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m45s)

[app I off against Azure because that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m47s)

[needed why am I checking out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m51s)

[need this checkout I don't think I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m58s)

[should need this because I'm pulling](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h30m59s)

[down the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m01s)

[migration yeah this checkout might be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m04s)

[superus um but then I just execute the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m06s)

[the migration you have to do a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m10s)

[execution stuff on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m12s)

[Linux because it doesn't give you the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m15s)

[execution permission by default so you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m17s)

[turn that on and then I feed it in my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h31m19s)

[actually okay when things merge slowly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h32m06s)

[like when things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h32m09s)

[are application Level it's much easier](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h32m12s)

[because I'm tempted to show something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h35m55s)

[and also tempted to not show it okay I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h35m57s)

[going to show it and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m00s)

[preface this this is a proof of concept](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m03s)

[library that I started](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m06s)

[on do not use](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m08s)

[it okay do not use](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m11s)

[this okay now with that said Here Comes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m17s)

[Here Comes the Badness this is not a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m21s)

[solution to your problem do not use this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m23s)

[this does very very very very very bad](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m25s)

[things so full send to production so for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m28s)

[people who aren't familiar f is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m31s)

[something that uh is a library for doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m33s)

[I weaving if you are not familiar with I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m35s)

[weaving the basic premise is this when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m38s)

[you compile a c libraryi to an assembly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m40s)

[uh unless you've done native compilation](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m43s)

[what you are getting is Intermediate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m46s)

[Language or IL ilil weaving is uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m48s)

[postprocessing that dll and manipulating](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m52s)

[the ilil now there is a lot of things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m55s)

[that you can do in I that there is not C](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h36m59s)

[syntax](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m02s)

[4 so you can do some really nasty stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m03s)

[uh what was the question the question](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m08s)

[was around uh mocking things that don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m10s)

[Implement interfaces and have internal](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m12s)

[stuff this is a tangent to the tangent](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m14s)

[so I'm I'm two levels deep um I will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m16s)

[show you the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m19s)

[tests and and How It Ends up working uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m21s)

[let's do like method return](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m24s)

[values okay so where is the system under](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m27s)

[test did I where did I put this here um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m30s)

[okay so assembly to test and this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m34s)

[Method return values okay so for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m37s)

[reference you will note in assembly to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m40s)

[test I have method return values there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m43s)

[are private methods that do stuff right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m46s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m51s)

[the thing right get 42 returns 42 okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m53s)

[pretty stupid simple let's look at the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h37m58s)

[return](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m00s)

[values uh o FY I use loads of those oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m02s)

[boy yeah again I he just to be clear my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m06s)

[premise before showing this project was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m09s)

[do not use it okay just so we're clear](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m12s)

[but the premise of this library was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m16s)

[wouldn't it be cool if I could declare a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m18s)

[class like this right make it a mirror](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m20s)

[again I like puns so this is a pun on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m24s)

[reflection make it a mirror of this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m27s)

[internal class and as long and then I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m29s)

[can abuse the x- turn keyword to be able](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m32s)

[to declare a method like get 42 without](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m34s)

[a method body because I don't care about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m37s)

[the method body I just want a method](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m39s)

[right and then once I have one of these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m42s)

[suckers right I can now come down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m45s)

[here and do some fun things where I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m49s)

[start saying saying Okay can when I call](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m52s)

[so you'll note I I create up one of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h38m57s)

[these mirror objects I call get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m00s)

[42 on this public extern method and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m03s)

[validate that I get 42 back I then call](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m08s)

[into my method invocation thing just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m11s)

[which that method invocation class is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m14s)

[just there as a way for me to really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m16s)

[verify I invoke the method inside the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m18s)

[assembly to test and verify that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m21s)

[called back out to it right so secretly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m23s)

[what's happening behind the hood is I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m26s)

[doing iil](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m27s)

[weaving to find these classes re and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m29s)

[actually insert a method body behind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m33s)

[this that reaches across into the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m36s)

[private thing over here here's the fun](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m40s)

[part no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m42s)

[reflection yeah yeah there's the confus](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m44s)

[when when your head starts to hurt let](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m48s)

[me know there's no reflection here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m49s)

[because reflection is slow and there's a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m52s)

[dirty trick that you can do the when you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m55s)

[go to invoke a private method or an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h39m59s)

[internal method or one that you don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m03s)

[have access to there are a few things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m04s)

[that stop you one the compiler stops you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m06s)

[and goes you don't have access to that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m10s)

[so the compiler won't let you declare a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m11s)

[symbol like get 42 that you don't have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m14s)

[access to um it started hurting as soon](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m17s)

[as there was no reflection yeah so the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m21s)

[the compiler stops you from declaring](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m23s)

[the symbol but if we hypothetically are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m24s)

[allowed to declare the symbol the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m28s)

[runtime then stops you because it goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m30s)

[no no no no no no no no no like like if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m32s)

[all you did was was weave in the iil for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m35s)

[invoking the method the runtime slaps](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m38s)

[you upside the head and says no you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m40s)

[don't get to invoke that method that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m43s)

[private what what do you think who you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m45s)

[think you are no no no no no and so the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m47s)

[runtime slaps you down the reflection](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m49s)

[apis are are special they can bypass](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m52s)

[that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m56s)

[crap yeah it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m56s)

[dirty um and normally like there there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h40m59s)

[a couple other ways to work around this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m02s)

[but there there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m05s)

[is there is an option to turn off the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m08s)

[runtime check for whether you have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m12s)

[access to something and say nah just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m14s)

[trust it let it go that's what this iio](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m16s)

[Weaver is doing it is telling the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m20s)

[runtime now ah just trust it it'll be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m22s)

[fine it'll be fine just invoke it yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m24s)

[yeah yeah uh again don't do this this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m28s)

[bad and so it it weaves that in and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m31s)

[slaps in uh an assembly attribute that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m34s)

[says yeah just let this thing fly don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m36s)

[don't bother to check it just let it go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m38s)

[and then you can invoke it so the speed](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m41s)

[of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m43s)

[this is pretty darn fast because it can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m44s)

[just straight up invoke the method no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m47s)

[reflection necessary doesn't take the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m49s)

[reflection](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m50s)

[hit it's all the your your hit is all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m51s)

[done at compile time when it has to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m54s)

[the weaving to be able to go through and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m56s)

[do this stuff again don't use this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m58s)

[Library this was a proof of concept to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h41m59s)

[prove that I can make it work don't do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m01s)

[this don't do this is horrible this is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m03s)

[horrible horrible code this was proof of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m05s)

[concept and then I went I really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m08s)

[shouldn't do this because the idea was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m09s)

[with reflection you'd have to like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m11s)

[hardcode strings and I'm like well this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m12s)

[is just a string right get 42 is just an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m14s)

[arbitrary string the fact that it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m17s)

[matches some down there the only](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m19s)

[Advantage is I can do compile time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m22s)

[checking to verify that this matches](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m24s)

[something in here so now it's like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m27s)

[compiled reflection is kind of cool the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m30s)

[next thing that'll make your head hurt](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m34s)

[is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m36s)

[uh is the assembly you compile against](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m38s)

[may not be your runtime assembly and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m41s)

[that's just a whole another bag of worms](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m43s)

[we won't even think about that uh how](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m45s)

[functional can you get with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m47s)

[C decent it's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m48s)

[it's not a functional language but you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m53s)

[can manipulate the you can manipulate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m55s)

[the the signatures a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h42m58s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m00s)

[uh uh I wish I had system myio namespace](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m03s)

[would more interfaces so I could replace](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m06s)

[file exist](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m08s)

[Etc Izzy let me Circle back to that in a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m09s)

[minute okay back to the actual question](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m12s)

[at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m14s)

[hand right uh let's see so I want this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m15s)

[and I want this so let's oh wait that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m18s)

[the C file I want the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m22s)

[project so going back to the original](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m25s)

[question that actually that that yonder](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m28s)

[asked right um I'm gonna just I'm G to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m30s)

[steal this because chat's going to keep](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m35s)

[moving and I don't want to lose it I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m37s)

[gonna just I'm gonna just snag that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m40s)

[and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m44s)

[uh let's see that is me doing something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m47s)

[else that I don't remember what it was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m50s)

[yeah okay so there's there's the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m53s)

[question right so we're g to we're going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m55s)

[to just keep that there and hold it down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m56s)

[uh wise man also said nou package exists](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h43m59s)

[but nobody wants](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m02s)

[that why do I feel like you're citing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m03s)

[things I may have told you before I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m05s)

[what what is the the phrase hey I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m08s)

[resemble that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m10s)

[remark something to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m12s)

[thereabouts uh let's see okay so the key](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m15s)

[thing here is we have a service from a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m19s)

[client Library so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m20s)

[uh uh actually we're going to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m26s)

[something we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m28s)

[weird right we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m30s)

[because I want to keep it all in one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m31s)

[file where I can see it so we're going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m33s)

[to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m34s)

[do like this right the only reason to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m36s)

[not use file scope Nam](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m40s)

[spaces uh client lib there we go because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m41s)

[I want two name](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m45s)

[spaces okay co-pilot what else you want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m46s)

[to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m49s)

[do okay right and and then let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m50s)

[see the Spider-Man pointing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m56s)

[me yes yes absolutely okay so let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h44m59s)

[the service does not Implement any](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m04s)

[interfaces check and the return types of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m06s)

[the methods I need are declared internal](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m09s)

[so the I I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m11s)

[guessing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m16s)

[internal uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m20s)

[Bo right so I so there's two ways I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m23s)

[interpret this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m26s)

[it because you can't actually do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m28s)

[this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m32s)

[right so when you say the return types](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m33s)

[are declared](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m36s)

[internal that either means the the class](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m37s)

[is declared internal or what I think is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m41s)

[probably more likely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m43s)

[is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m46s)

[this right I see this pattern a lot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m49s)

[where the type is declared public so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m52s)

[that it could exist on the public API](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m53s)

[but then the ability to instantiate it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m56s)

[or similar right is not is not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h45m58s)

[exposed right so Yonder correct me if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m03s)

[I'm wrong because I I want to make sure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m05s)

[I get this in so here here is the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m07s)

[problem right with any of the major](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m10s)

[mocking libraries they are built on a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m12s)

[library called Castle Dynamic](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m14s)

[proxy um Castle Dynamic](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m17s)

[proxy has very little magic in it um it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m20s)

[has kind of a sucky API which is why you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m25s)

[have all of these other mocking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m28s)

[libraries that are built on top of it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m29s)

[because Castle's library is powerful it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m32s)

[lets you do a lot of stuff which is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m34s)

[sweet but it's not exactly friendly and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m37s)

[sometimes you end up doing a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m41s)

[typing so often times these other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m42s)

[libraries have come up on top of it and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m44s)

[they leverage it so the key thing that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m47s)

[it does is it allows you to give it a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m49s)

[call it a base type I'm I'm putting it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m52s)

[in air quotes because don't think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m54s)

[polymorphism here but you can feed it a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h46m57s)

[type and say give me a class that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m00s)

[derives from this so when you do mock oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m03s)

[should actually add](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m06s)

[mock](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m10s)

[browse right boom](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m12s)

[install yeld di framework yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m17s)

[yeah so when you do mock](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m23s)

[of this right so if we do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m26s)

[this uh oh I don't want to mock Fu I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m29s)

[want to mock client right so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m32s)

[this is where we're going with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m35s)

[this if we do this right and we do we do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m37s)

[mock of client this is functionally no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m40s)

[different than if I were to go through](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m43s)

[and do private class my mock drives you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m45s)

[got to spell it correctly though because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m50s)

[that's that's just embarrassing right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m52s)

[it's doing nothing more than if I were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m55s)

[to do this and then it promptly takes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h47m57s)

[whatever type you feed in and says okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m00s)

[I'm going to look at that type and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m03s)

[anything that's virtual I'm going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m05s)

[create uh implementations or overrides](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m06s)

[for right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m09s)

[so it immediately is going to run into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m11s)

[problems because it can't override a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m14s)

[non- virtual member right like this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m18s)

[right cannot override inherited member](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m21s)

[because it's not marked virtual abstract](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m24s)

[or override right non virtual members](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m26s)

[you can't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m29s)

[override and there's oh dang it I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m30s)

[forgot how do I get what's the magical](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m34s)

[incantation to get my cursor back and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m37s)

[remember](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m41s)

[that shoot I did this before and I got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m43s)

[bit and I trying to remember what I did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m46s)

[to get it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m48s)

[back it one then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m50s)

[shoot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m56s)

[um I had to take a Java midterm tonight](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h48m59s)

[on Advanced object-oriented programming](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m02s)

[and this is starting to get into a lot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m04s)

[of the stuff I've been struggling with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m05s)

[probably didn't do too good on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m07s)

[it that's that's totally fine like I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m09s)

[failed a lot of those tests the first](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m12s)

[time I took them myself so it don't feel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m13s)

[bad at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m17s)

[all so but because this thing is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m18s)

[Queens home Castle wior oh I love it I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m23s)

[feel so I know enough about Great](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m27s)

[Britain and in the United Kingdom to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m30s)

[track with that I have a strange feeling](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m32s)

[that is missed on a good portion of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m34s)

[world for for people who who aren't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m36s)

[familiar with that you should Google it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m39s)

[um yeah I've lost my cursor again so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m41s)

[this is exciting you guys can see my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m43s)

[cursor I can't which is which is making](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m45s)

[this GNA this is going to make this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m48s)

[really interesting so in order to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m50s)

[this kind of mocking you can't actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m53s)

[mock client right so it was a free](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h49m55s)

[respons uh and I'm pretty sure I said](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m00s)

[abstract classes meant that their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m03s)

[methods can be used differently](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m05s)

[depending on the class that calls them](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m06s)

[um yeah I guess it depends on how it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m12s)

[phrased those types of questions are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m14s)

[actually so what if you take a test on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m16s)

[it hopefully you get back a list of what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m18s)

[you got wrong and the correct answers](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m21s)

[because those types of questions](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m24s)

[actually show up quite a bit on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m25s)

[interviews as well people love asking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m27s)

[oop questions on interviews specifically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m30s)

[around inheritance polymorphism abstract](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m33s)

[interfaces those things show up all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m35s)

[time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m37s)

[so I would say whatever you get wrong](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m39s)

[hammer down and make sure that you uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m42s)

[learn it well because it does show up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m45s)

[quite a bit um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m47s)

[oh is that Pikachu is that an acronym](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m54s)

[I'm noticing the letters line up with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m57s)

[what I just said and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h50m59s)

[figure out the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m00s)

[e that's an acronym please share because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m02s)

[that that looks good so the the way you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m05s)

[actually end up having to do this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m07s)

[with a pattern called um a port so what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m09s)

[you would end up doing is something like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m14s)

[public class uh my client port](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m16s)

[right and the the the other magical word](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m23s)

[here is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m26s)

[delegation right so my client Port](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m27s)

[delegates and so in this case what you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m32s)

[end up doing is you don't derive from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m34s)

[client right this guy contains client](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m37s)

[right so something like this right and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m41s)

[then you do something like public](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m44s)

[virtual get client public virtual string](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m46s)

[get client name okay co-pilot impress](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m50s)

[me that's not we we don't too string](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m54s)

[that crap don't be dumb](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m57s)

[co-pilot uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h51m59s)

[oh right so this then becomes Fu right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m01s)

[so it does it does abstraction](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m05s)

[polymorphism inheritance encapsulation](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m07s)

[oh that's what I was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m10s)

[missing o p Pi I love](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m12s)

[it yes that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m17s)

[great um the key idea here with this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m20s)

[port is one you now control the port](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m23s)

[right you've taken the the client uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m27s)

[service that is outside of your control](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m30s)

[and you've wrapped it inside of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m33s)

[something that you do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m34s)

[control right uh it could also be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m36s)

[asynchronous yeah yeah so and because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m40s)

[you control it you can actually if it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m42s)

[needs to be async async tasu or similar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m44s)

[right like you can you can expose this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m48s)

[up however it needs to end up going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m49s)

[um but it means that now when you come](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m53s)

[up here you can actually do something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m55s)

[like my client Port right and now if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h52m57s)

[want to you can actually do setups on it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m01s)

[and mock will be okay with this because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m05s)

[the method is marked as virtual now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m06s)

[quite often with these ports rather than](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m09s)

[marking this guy as virtual a more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m10s)

[common thing to do is people will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m13s)

[because people are very familiar with um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m15s)

[doing it with interfaces so I client](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m18s)

[right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m22s)

[a lot of times people will go this route](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m24s)

[declare their own interface along with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m27s)

[the port and then this mock just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m29s)

[becomes I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m33s)

[client right both work just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m35s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m38s)

[um uh so that's exactly what I did but I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m40s)

[was thinking it was more of a temp](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m42s)

[solution oh good so you landed on the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m44s)

[right answer no it the the hard part is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m45s)

[there's when you don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m49s)

[control the the library it gets a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m51s)

[difficult and in some degree some places](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m54s)

[people actually go as far as to make](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m56s)

[ports for all external libraries so that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h53m59s)

[and this is where I think it's it goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m04s)

[it's a little too extreme is if you if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m06s)

[you make a port for every external](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m10s)

[library that you have yes it allows you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m12s)

[to kind of encapsulate that library and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m14s)

[keep it from leaking into your other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m17s)

[code but you also are generating a lot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m19s)

[of extra work for very little gain often](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m21s)

[times people do it because they're like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m25s)

[well if we ever change away from this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m27s)

[library then I don't have to change as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m28s)

[many](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m30s)

[places my opinion that's a what if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m31s)

[unless you have reason to believe that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m34s)

[that's actually going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m35s)

[happen don't right like there's very few](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m37s)

[times where the amount of effort you put](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m41s)

[in to creating all of those](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m44s)

[encapsulations um and ports pays](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m46s)

[dividends right because the question is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m49s)

[what's going to cost more making all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m51s)

[those ports up front or doing a bigger](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m54s)

[refactor if it if it ever comes right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h54m57s)

[that's that that's the tension there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m00s)

[because obviously if you let the types](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m02s)

[leak around and then like that Library](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m04s)

[makes a breaking change or you move away](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m06s)

[from it um you you get stuck doing it uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m08s)

[what's the name of that pattern so I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m12s)

[believe the one man not having a cursor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m14s)

[to look at I need to remember not to hit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m18s)

[control F4 uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m20s)

[Port believe it's the port adapter me](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m23s)

[just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m29s)

[uh I've heard it go man where's my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m31s)

[cursor I need it to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m35s)

[there not bad for not being able to see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m37s)

[a cursor uh I need my cursor to go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m39s)

[there there there is another name for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m47s)

[this and I'm I'm now blanking on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m50s)

[this because the the the the port](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m54s)

[adapter pattern is very much something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h55m58s)

[it crops up a lot for people who do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m01s)

[domain driven design um and a bit in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m04s)

[clean architecture as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m07s)

[well um you'll note that this hexagonal](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m08s)

[architecture defined in 2005 and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m13s)

[later renamed so it it kind of goes by](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m16s)

[different proxy pattern maybe I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m19s)

[know if that's the one that I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m23s)

[heard](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m28s)

[look yeah I need my cursor to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m31s)

[there nope there uh let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m35s)

[here oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m40s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m44s)

[yeah let's see proxy design pattern](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m48s)

[employee](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m51s)

[yeah this this is this is exactly what I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m55s)

[was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h56m58s)

[describing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m02s)

[yeah yeah and there are it takes on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m04s)

[different flavors too um the so in this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m07s)

[in this sample here I just literally am](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m13s)

[passing straight through right there is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m15s)

[nothing fancy whatsoever about this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m17s)

[method some sometimes and this is I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m20s)

[think why I've favored using like the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m24s)

[port adapter name for it because um when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m27s)

[you go with proxy the implication is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m31s)

[that this thing is just a pass through](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m34s)

[that it doesn't do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m36s)

[anything sometimes with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m39s)

[ports you might do a little bit of work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m41s)

[right you might like in this case this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m44s)

[is what I would call a very leaky](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m47s)

[abstraction right because even though](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m49s)

[I've written an interface with client](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m51s)

[the return type here is still](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m53s)

[Foo so if client lib is actually an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m55s)

[external Library I'm still leaking the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h57m59s)

[food type up through my interface into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m01s)

[the rest of my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m03s)

[application so sometimes you might go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m05s)

[further and go well maybe what I'll do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m08s)

[is I'll make another rapper class for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m11s)

[Foo and I'll return that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m13s)

[instead um the underlying type in Castle](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m15s)

[is Castle proxy yeah that I believe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m19s)

[um so there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m22s)

[is with the ports sometimes you do extra](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m25s)

[work right sometimes you massage data](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m28s)

[sometimes you maybe make multiple calls](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m32s)

[to get all the data that you need and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m33s)

[bring it back or similar right like that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m35s)

[those types of things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m38s)

[are um possible I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m41s)

[what I did last time to get the cursor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m44s)

[back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m45s)

[sorry I to remember what I did to get my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m48s)

[cursor back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h58m51s)

[okay there is that now I can move this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m00s)

[around I want to get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m04s)

[my I did basically a straight through](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m07s)

[for most of the methods but for a couple](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m10s)

[methods I changed to return a simpler](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m12s)

[non- internal return type yeah and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m14s)

[think that's perfect like that is that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m16s)

[is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m18s)

[very legitimate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m19s)

[solution okay I'm kind of scared that if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m22s)

[I close this I'm going to lose it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m25s)

[completely we're going to try it yeah I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m26s)

[still don't have my still don't have my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m30s)

[cursor I know you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m33s)

[guys I need to figure out what is doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m35s)

[this and fix](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m39s)

[it was it three nope](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=01h59m47s)

[one gape one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m00s)

[one two sorry I realized people are just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m04s)

[watching me draw](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m07s)

[pictures](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m10s)

[hi](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m12s)

[see but I still can't see my cursor and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m15s)

[this is really bloody annoying](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m18s)

[really really bloody annoying how do I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m22s)

[get this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m24s)

[back I wonder if I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m26s)

[can we're going to try something I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m28s)

[wonder if I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m31s)

[can restart explore to trigger](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m32s)

[it oh that didn't go where we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m39s)

[wanted he that killed Explorer relaunch](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m46s)

[Rel launch come on there we go okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h00m59s)

[restarting Explorer fixes it I'm going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m02s)

[to remember that ah cursor how I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m05s)

[missed you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m08s)

[okay there's that there's that there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m10s)

[that we'll save](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m13s)

[that okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m14s)

[so remaining stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m19s)

[okay so we're going to do a little velop](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m23s)

[pack stuff because I've got some work to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m25s)

[do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m28s)

[and I still have Mountain Dew left okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m31s)

[so for reference for everybody the velop](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m36s)

[PAC API isy yeah no problem Yonder uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m39s)

[this is a private](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m43s)

[repository however my partner kayin has](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m45s)

[agreed that it is perfectly fine to show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m48s)

[it on stream](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m50s)

[because at the end of the day it's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m52s)

[like people can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m55s)

[really uh recreate just from the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h01m57s)

[streaming stuff but you're going to see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m02s)

[some of the patterns that are in here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m04s)

[and whatnot we've identified a handful](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m05s)

[of things that are remaining for our](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m08s)

[public beta we apologize it was supposed](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m10s)

[to be done a while ago but then I got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m12s)

[sick and had a busy couple weeks he had](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m15s)

[life happen to him things slipped](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m18s)

[through the cracks and yeah took a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m20s)

[little longer than expected but we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m22s)

[very close](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m23s)

[again restart Explorer isn't that almost](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m28s)

[as bad as pull plug out and prey yeah I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m30s)

[mean yeah it is it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m34s)

[is okay so internally inside a velop Pac](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m39s)

[there are and maybe I'll just show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m43s)

[this there we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m46s)

[go okay and so if I go app.](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m50s)

[vac. and dirty secret technically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m54s)

[anybody can go hit this right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m57s)

[now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h02m59s)

[um however everybody will be landing on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m01s)

[a free subscription and so if you wait](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m04s)

[until we open up public beta uh people](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m06s)

[can get free Pro subscriptions or I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m09s)

[remember what we said some number of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m14s)

[months three Pro subscriptions for X](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m16s)

[number of months where X is a number](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m19s)

[that I've already](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m21s)

[forgotten um because we want people to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m22s)

[be able to do this okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m24s)

[that Uno sample one that I was showing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m27s)

[off before is kind of floating in here I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m29s)

[believe it's this one and if we uh look](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m32s)

[at the releases right we see this kind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m36s)

[of thing here and you can see we've got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m38s)

[this nice little paging control stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m40s)

[you can see I've published a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m43s)

[versions but you'll note here that for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m44s)

[version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m47s)

[1.0.7 we've got a bunch of files that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m48s)

[got up loaded we have the the full](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m51s)

[release package which is a nougat](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m54s)

[package that contains everything and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m56s)

[think if I go here I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h03m59s)

[can just show all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m01s)

[columns](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m04s)

[yeah oh interesting it hides the banner](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m06s)

[when you do that didn't know it did that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m08s)

[huh that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m11s)

[interesting um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m13s)

[the let's see I I don't care about this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m15s)

[I don't care about this I didn't realize](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m19s)

[we had so many columns yeah I don't care](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m21s)

[about this okay so I really only care](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m23s)

[about a few things and actually I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m25s)

[even care about Channel High Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m27s)

[column this is what I care about I care](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m28s)

[about type and size that's that's what's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m30s)

[important so you'll know the the app](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m32s)

[total size is about 22 Meg zipped the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m34s)

[setup is a little bit bigger because it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m38s)

[contains the setup bootstrapper plus the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m40s)

[full package so it's the the setup's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m42s)

[always going to be at least as big as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m45s)

[your full](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m46s)

[package there's a portable version of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m48s)

[your app which not shocking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m50s)

[this is a ZIP file of your application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m53s)

[which is going to be real close to this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m55s)

[um because this is this thing plus a a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h04m59s)

[manifest so not a whole lot there and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m01s)

[then there's a Delta package which is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m04s)

[significantly smaller and in this case](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m05s)

[this Delta is going from 16 to 17](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m07s)

[because the Delta packages um tend to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m11s)

[a quick way of doing updates when you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m14s)

[don't have to download everything when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m16s)

[there's only a handful of things that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m18s)

[change don't don't don't waste your time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m19s)

[with all of it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m20s)

[but all of this stuff here each of these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m22s)

[are individual release assets that have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m25s)

[been uploaded and the fact that they all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m27s)

[have the same version number completely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m29s)

[circumstantial inside of the code what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m32s)

[we have here is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m34s)

[a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m39s)

[uh why am I not seeing application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m41s)

[release right they they are made up of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m44s)

[one of these things right and it has a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m47s)

[whole bunch of stuff on it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m49s)

[right it's got a type it's got an ID](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m52s)

[it's got a hash it's got a size it's got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m54s)

[a file name and versioning information](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m56s)

[and all that stuff what we would like to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h05m59s)

[do is create a release group that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m01s)

[contains all of these things in it right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m04s)

[because most of the time people don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m07s)

[want to act on five separate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m09s)

[or four I can't count four separate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m12s)

[files they want to act on one group of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m16s)

[files and in future we may end up having](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m19s)

[more than one Delta as well right so we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m22s)

[would like to change up what is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m25s)

[happening so that we have a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m27s)

[group in here and have basic crud](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m29s)

[operations and similar stuff on that the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m32s)

[only thing that gets weird is a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m34s)

[group isn't something that somebody](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m36s)

[creates it's not like it's not like a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m38s)

[Channel or similar where people can go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m41s)

[through and or I shouldn't say Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m43s)

[like if I go to my projects I can create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m46s)

[a new project well a release group isn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m48s)

[something that's there's be a create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m50s)

[endpoint for there's going to be a uh an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m52s)

[implicit creation of it as you upload](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m55s)

[these release assets and they're going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m58s)

[to be grouped by version because that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h06m59s)

[what logically makes sense the other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m02s)

[thing is if we do like Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m04s)

[promotions and things like that you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m05s)

[probably want to act on these all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m07s)

[way across the other thing to be aware](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m09s)

[of is a release group is going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m11s)

[specific to a channel in this case a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m13s)

[channel is just windows but this is an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m15s)

[UNO application so you can imagine that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m17s)

[maybe there would be a Mac Channel or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m19s)

[similar right because even though in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m20s)

[code like all the multi-platform stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m23s)

[likes to make it think that you're just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m26s)

[writing one codebase at the end of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m27s)

[day you're compiling separate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m29s)

[applications for each of your target](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m31s)

[output yeah metag group basically is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m33s)

[what we're going for so what we want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m35s)

[implement is actually a release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m37s)

[and put all of these things inside of it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m40s)

[and muck with the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m42s)

[database so that's what that's what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m44s)

[we're going to build that's what we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m46s)

[going to build that's where we're going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m48s)

[that's where we're going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m50s)

[so step one we're going to make a new](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m52s)

[thingy uh let's see new item and I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m54s)

[I'm just going to call it a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m57s)

[group I have no reason not to I want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h07m59s)

[know how Uno was able to get all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m02s)

[their stuff to the top of my items](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m03s)

[list kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m07s)

[annoying but I'm also mildly impressed](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m10s)

[they were able to do that I don't know](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m13s)

[how you do that or maybe it was just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m15s)

[because they're the latest extension I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m16s)

[installed um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m19s)

[okay so this is inside of n framework so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m23s)

[I do have a base entity we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m26s)

[we're going to derive from because that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m28s)

[gives me uh my ID column because I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m30s)

[goid all the things clean up all my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m33s)

[usings okay so we can steal some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m36s)

[inspiration a little bit from an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m39s)

[application release and I don't think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m41s)

[we're going to change too much we are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m43s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m46s)

[steal this much because these are the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m47s)

[versioning bits](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m50s)

[oh look at that it it created a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m52s)

[stuff for me no all right we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m54s)

[turn that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h08m57s)

[off okay and then right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m02s)

[now release Channel contains a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m07s)

[collection of releases and so we want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m09s)

[change that up rather than release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m11s)

[Channel containing a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m14s)

[releases we want release group to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m16s)

[contain the releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m19s)

[is fine I don't think I dropped the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m22s)

[data off my application release for now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m26s)

[I think I'm going to leave it there's no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m30s)

[point in getting rid of it it's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m33s)

[hurting me to do this um but I do need](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m34s)

[to set up a relationship here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m41s)

[between uh my release group so if I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m42s)

[do release group ID and for people](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m47s)

[unfamiliar with um Entity framework this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m50s)

[naming there there's a lot of magic that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m53s)

[happens in Entity](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m56s)

[framework um based upon](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h09m57s)

[convention right so it because I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m01s)

[named this release group ID and this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m03s)

[release group it knows that this is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m05s)

[related entity and this is the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m09s)

[foreign key across to it we'll see that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m12s)

[when we generate the migrations I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m15s)

[trying to decide if releases still live](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m17s)

[in channels or if they're just gone from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m19s)

[that trying to decide if that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m26s)

[matters because the release group is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m30s)

[going to is going to need a channel so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m34s)

[so this much here is definitely going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m36s)

[make its way up into here and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m38s)

[release Channel rather than having this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m41s)

[I I really want it to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m44s)

[be release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m46s)

[uh let's see release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m51s)

[groups I do want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m54s)

[that so if if channels dropping from it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m56s)

[then that makes this pretty easy then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h10m59s)

[this should really go away we're just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m01s)

[adding a level of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m02s)

[nesting okay that goes there that goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m04s)

[there release group its parent is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m07s)

[a sorry there was a little bug on my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m12s)

[monitor bothered me uh so it goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m15s)

[Channel then group and then in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m18s)

[individual releases inside of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m21s)

[it this sets up the relationship to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m23s)

[parent this sets up the relationship to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m25s)

[the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m27s)

[children this has a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m28s)

[version Izzy good luck at work got to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m30s)

[train end users H how to suck](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m34s)

[eggs I I don't envy you right now I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m38s)

[gonna have fun so try to have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m42s)

[fun um worst case scenario use your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m45s)

[analogy about shooting ducks](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m48s)

[see if that see if that communicates](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m52s)

[anything it it may cause](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m54s)

[confusion um do I need anything else on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h11m57s)

[my release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m01s)

[group that we are going to have a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m04s)

[concept for like whether it's uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m06s)

[complete or valid or not but I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m10s)

[that's going to be computed based upon](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m12s)

[the releases inside of it so I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m14s)

[this might be all I need for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m17s)

[now that's probably good okay we are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m19s)

[going to need a table for it so we are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m23s)

[going to come up here and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m25s)

[put it right in the middle here uh yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m27s)

[thank you co-pilot thank you for doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m29s)

[the work that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m32s)

[needed that gets me there that gets me](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m33s)

[there that gets me there let's compile](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m35s)

[and see how bad it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m37s)

[is because I did just change a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m41s)

[forign key stuff I kind of expect some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m44s)

[stuff to break](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m46s)

[get some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m51s)

[sleep it is late for the for the vast](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m53s)

[majority of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m55s)

[people okay so now first question that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h12m58s)

[comes is an application release was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m02s)

[previously deemed unique based upon its](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m04s)

[uh version its](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m08s)

[ID its type whether it was enabled or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m11s)

[not that's actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m15s)

[wrong that's wrong I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m19s)

[want packages differing just by their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m22s)

[enabled](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m25s)

[flag](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m26s)

[um and actually I think we can just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m32s)

[change this to release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m34s)

[ID um we are going to ensure that there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m36s)

[are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m40s)

[no oh this is this is interesting though](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m43s)

[because I am going to have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m48s)

[duplicate release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m52s)

[groups do I need to make sure that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m57s)

[don't have duplicate release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h13m59s)

[groups I don't think that's a problem](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m02s)

[that's not that's not a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m06s)

[problem yeah I did this to make sure I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m09s)

[didn't double up but this was because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m12s)

[this is a user provided](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m15s)

[thing I'm generating these so if I do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m18s)

[something so that's they're fully in my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m21s)

[control that's okay they're fully in my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m23s)

[control I'm not going to worry about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m26s)

[it because we're not even going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m28s)

[expose an API endpoint for like creating](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m30s)

[these things so it's like the only way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m33s)

[it goes wrong is if I do something wrong](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m36s)

[okay so what are we doing here uh get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m40s)

[project used bytes so this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m42s)

[is here if we go back and look at my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m46s)

[projects](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m49s)

[right if I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m52s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m54s)

[one uh where does where do we show it is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h14m57s)

[it under](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m00s)

[teams yeah here we go so under my teams](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m04s)

[list my my projects show how many total](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m07s)

[bytes they are actually using so that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m11s)

[what this method is is effectively just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m13s)

[ripping through everything inside of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m15s)

[project and going how much space have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m17s)

[you actually used I get shocking I got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m19s)

[up to 1.1 gigs on my Uno app with with I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m21s)

[mean I guess I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m27s)

[got go 100](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m29s)

[pages right I've got a decent number of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m31s)

[things here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m35s)

[but not that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m37s)

[many so but that's what this calculation](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m39s)

[is is is ripping through these so uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m42s)

[let's see join G in context](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m46s)

[do uh release groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m51s)

[on let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m55s)

[see release Channel ID join release in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h15m57s)

[applications on this is going to be GID](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m01s)

[and this is going to be release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m05s)

[ID so this is really just joining](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m08s)

[across uh all of these things finding](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m11s)

[where the team matches a particular team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m15s)

[ID and then grabbing the project and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m18s)

[calculate out the total bytes so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m21s)

[building up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m24s)

[that dictionary across great so I have a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m26s)

[feeling we're going to have a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m30s)

[these type of things select Mini release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m33s)

[groups like many releases size right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m38s)

[this is used](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m41s)

[byes based on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m43s)

[team I'm wondering if I should collapse](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m46s)

[these because I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m49s)

[well but this is filtering](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m51s)

[down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h16m54s)

[required](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m35s)

[why okay what I'm curious on is why](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m37s)

[don't I just do this get project used by](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m39s)

[a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m43s)

[team token](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m48s)

[right so this gets me the uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m55s)

[VAR](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h17m59s)

[uh dictionary gets a weight right so you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m01s)

[do that and then you return dictionary](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m04s)

[value](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m08s)

[sum right because this is literally just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m10s)

[summing up the size of all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m13s)

[releases this is summing up the size of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m15s)

[all the releases and grouping them](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m18s)

[but if I sum up all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m23s)

[groups I don't see a problem with this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m28s)

[I've got a I've got good test coverage](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m30s)

[in this project so I'm not real](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m32s)

[concerned about making a change like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m34s)

[this if there is a problem the test will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m36s)

[tell](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m39s)

[me which is a I want to just say this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m40s)

[a wonderful place to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m43s)

[be like when I I am I am highly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m45s)

[confident that when my tests pass](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m48s)

[everything's fine just so wonderful I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m51s)

[put myself back over](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m54s)

[here what is the visual studio](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h18m58s)

[notification no Uno you don't get an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m00s)

[update right now I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m02s)

[busy okay so we're GNA have a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m03s)

[these things here so let's see this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m06s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m07s)

[projects I'm mildly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m19s)

[tempted I'm mildly tempted to have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m25s)

[release groups actually have a size on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m27s)

[them yeah let's do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m33s)

[that let's give release groups a size um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m37s)

[because I don't see a reason not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m41s)

[to we're going to make it a required](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m47s)

[property because there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m49s)

[because I control this entirely there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m51s)

[no reason not to and then I can save](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m53s)

[myself](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m57s)

[a I could save myself having to go down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h19m59s)

[a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m02s)

[level uh let's see uh what is get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m05s)

[latest](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m10s)

[do uh get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m14s)

[latest cuz this is just no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m18s)

[ing I kind of wonder if I bring this one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m23s)

[up as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m25s)

[well right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m26s)

[uh I I think we bring a last modified up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m33s)

[onto the release group as well because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m36s)

[that that saves us a lot of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m39s)

[trouble because the group is the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m45s)

[modifications to this group are are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m48s)

[basically going to be item added to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m50s)

[it right and I think we'll do a created](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m55s)

[at as well as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h20m58s)

[a uh last modified at um I've got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m01s)

[a kind of a couple clever tricks in here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m06s)

[so one I have um these guys which are EF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m09s)

[configuration classes so these allow for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m14s)

[a nice easy way of configur figuring](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m17s)

[up um how the database should interact](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m22s)

[with this object so for example in this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m24s)

[case it's saying the created at column](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m26s)

[which you'll note is a readon property](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m29s)

[that I'm never](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m31s)

[setting but I am telling it to use a uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m32s)

[default SQL value where it will do the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m37s)

[system date](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m40s)

[time so whenever the record is is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m42s)

[inserted into the database the database](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m44s)

[just records the created app and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m47s)

[this entity's property magically gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m48s)

[set by EF despite not having a Setter](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m50s)

[just works just works wonderful the last](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m53s)

[modified um is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h21m58s)

[a little trick with this guy here right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m01s)

[as long as I put this interface onto](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m04s)

[it as long as I put this interface onto](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m10s)

[here there's a oh long as I remember how](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m12s)

[to do The Inheritance that we were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m16s)

[talking about earlier there's a a clever](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m18s)

[little trick going on where I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m20s)

[got this Interceptor up here last update](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m24s)

[Interceptor so this is a an EF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m27s)

[Interceptor that is watching for Save](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m30s)

[changes and when save changes occurs if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m33s)

[the entity is either added or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m36s)

[modified it updates the last modified](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m38s)

[time stamp for me so I don't have to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m41s)

[muck with that one either long as I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m42s)

[got this guy on here he's appropriately](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m45s)

[tagged and it just works](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m48s)

[and then I don't have to think about the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m51s)

[rest so problem](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m52s)

[solved okay so that handles](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h22m57s)

[those then that means back over](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m00s)

[here I can actually Implement get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m03s)

[latest](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m07s)

[on I can do this and I can do this on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m11s)

[release group we will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m15s)

[see okay so this guy's usage actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m18s)

[drops we're just going to take him](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m22s)

[out uh so it does release groups created](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m25s)

[at select first first or default great I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m28s)

[don't think that indented properly I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m31s)

[think it's got an extra space there okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m33s)

[great so that will get that and that now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m37s)

[works uh select](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m41s)

[Min release groups that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m43s)

[works number of releases this is an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m46s)

[interesting one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m49s)

[this is an interesting one to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m51s)

[show I think it actually makes more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m54s)

[sense to show the number of release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m56s)

[groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h23m58s)

[here because right now it's counting up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m00s)

[all of these but would you expect to see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m03s)

[if you release version 106 the number of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m05s)

[releases shown I I think it makes more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m09s)

[sense um if we show the oh I think it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m12s)

[back on the other project page](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m17s)

[um uh that's last release where do we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m22s)

[show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m25s)

[this thought we had somewhere where we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m26s)

[showed the number](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m29s)

[of maybe unused in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m30s)

[UI um I I think in this case showing the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m33s)

[release group count probably makes more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m37s)

[sense that way like version 106 counts](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m40s)

[for one rather than for four because if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m43s)

[you added a Delta package do you really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m45s)

[expect the number of your releases to go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m47s)

[up weird feels weird Okay so that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m49s)

[handles those airs](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m52s)

[compile](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m54s)

[close close close](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h24m56s)

[close and I don't doubt that I'm about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m01s)

[to have a slew of tests to fix as soon](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m04s)

[as this thing passes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m05s)

[compilation you'll note I tend to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m08s)

[do like I don't do full test driven](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m11s)

[design in some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m14s)

[cases but I do make sure everything's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m16s)

[covered with test because I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m18s)

[holy crap 61 errors so I uh I broke some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m20s)

[stuff let's see so this is listing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m25s)

[channels number of releases this is Once](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m27s)

[Again release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m29s)

[count um let's see current btes that one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m31s)

[we added and latest created at we added](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m34s)

[that so that goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m37s)

[there uh let's see so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m38s)

[showing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m42s)

[releases I think what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m45s)

[change this thing up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m47s)

[so I've got a set of API models because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m50s)

[these are the things that actually get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m53s)

[surfaced out of the API rather than](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m54s)

[through um rather than uh surfacing up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h25m58s)

[like database entities or similar but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m01s)

[I'm I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m04s)

[if because this doesn't make sense](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m06s)

[anymore right because this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m10s)

[now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m14s)

[here I kind of kind of want to drop the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m18s)

[word application off these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m20s)

[honestly no no no that's that is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m23s)

[refactor for another day](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m28s)

[public let's see record](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m31s)

[class uh release group and yes this has](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m34s)

[made my life miserable by by naming](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m37s)

[these things like this but darn it I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m40s)

[doing it anyway let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m42s)

[so what stop helping me co-pilot you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m45s)

[annoying me right now and you're not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m48s)

[you're not making your life better okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m50s)

[so we're going to do that because you'll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m52s)

[know we flat even though version is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m54s)

[multiple properties in the database we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m55s)

[flatten it for the API because no one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h26m57s)

[cares I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m00s)

[think I think we're going to have an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m06s)

[enabled property on the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m08s)

[API it won't exist in the database but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m13s)

[we will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m15s)

[have we will have that because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m17s)

[I think there's no reason not to expose](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m21s)

[this up because we needed it at one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m22s)

[point](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m24s)

[um because on the the API if you CH uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m26s)

[do something with is enabled on the way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m32s)

[in or out it's just going to apply to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m33s)

[all of the releases inside of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m35s)

[them that does beg the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m37s)

[question this should probably be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m40s)

[nullable no I don't know because if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m45s)

[disable one of the releases in a group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m47s)

[the group's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m50s)

[disabled take this off I don't like that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m53s)

[I don't like it it's going to I'm G to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m56s)

[we're going to have to do special apis](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h27m58s)

[okay so this is going to go here we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m00s)

[going to move you into your own type](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m02s)

[release channel here is then going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m04s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m08s)

[group right and that will go there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m09s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m13s)

[groups that goes like that great](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m15s)

[think that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m22s)

[works kin's going to hate me when I make](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m30s)

[this change admittedly he advocated for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m32s)

[it so he knows it's coming but oh boy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m34s)

[this is G this is gonna this is going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m37s)

[break smap eyes this is another reason](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m38s)

[why like we were trying to get all these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m42s)

[breaking API things in because once we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m44s)

[have people using our site you have to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m46s)

[be a lot more careful about breaking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m48s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m49s)

[and I just don't want to be careful](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m50s)

[right now okay so this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m51s)

[is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m53s)

[channel we're getting back the details](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m56s)

[for a channel so this is release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h28m58s)

[groups right this is going to be release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m02s)

[groups then this was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m06s)

[converting uh down here but I actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m08s)

[want to do a variant of this where we go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m12s)

[no this is going to be a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m15s)

[group uh and then this is going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m18s)

[get release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m23s)

[group this is going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m25s)

[the release group so you'll note here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m28s)

[this release group this release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m31s)

[are not the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m34s)

[same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m35s)

[and why are you not showing up oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m40s)

[because I need to add the using up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m43s)

[above because I've named these things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m49s)

[the same this is the only reason for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m51s)

[this kind of garbage is because I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m53s)

[am I'm aliasing them so that I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h29m57s)

[have to think nearly as hard uh so get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m00s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m04s)

[group and then this get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m05s)

[version existed down here on application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m08s)

[release I think we bring It Forward onto](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m12s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m14s)

[group a nice convenient way of doing it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m15s)

[and then I don't have to worry too much](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m20s)

[about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m22s)

[it we're not going to have an isn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m23s)

[enabled we're not going to have any of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m26s)

[this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m28s)

[garbage right and so release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m29s)

[group is this guy here I mean we can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m32s)

[kind of preemptively we like we know](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m35s)

[what some of these are going to be as I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m37s)

[typically do then a details class that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m39s)

[contains the uh related entities so the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m41s)

[difference is the base class is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m44s)

[typically your your basic items like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m47s)

[what you might display in a list and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m50s)

[then the details variant of that is the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m52s)

[the one that actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m55s)

[contains](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m57s)

[record is the one that actually contains](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h30m59s)

[the related child entities so in this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m02s)

[case application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m04s)

[release then this becomes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m05s)

[releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m10s)

[Boya that gets me to there and there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m12s)

[probably there's probably going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m16s)

[one of these suckers as well so we might](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m18s)

[as well do it while we're in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m20s)

[here and we're probably going to need](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m22s)

[it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m24s)

[uh I tried to standardize the name of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m26s)

[all these release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m29s)

[group list](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m32s)

[response then this is release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m34s)

[group release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m39s)

[groups dun dun dun dunun that goes there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m41s)

[that goes there that goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m45s)

[there okay see what do we got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m47s)

[uh right we were changing this thing up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m52s)

[this should become get release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h31m55s)

[group and then we don't have much on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m00s)

[here ID version right there's not a lot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m03s)

[more ID version created at is the only](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m06s)

[other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m10s)

[one created at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m11s)

[gets uh created at and then this should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m15s)

[really be called called release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m19s)

[group that goes there that goes there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m22s)

[that goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m24s)

[there Dent](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m26s)

[great this guy is now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m28s)

[dead do I need you for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m32s)

[anything don't think so I need you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m36s)

[that's what G is for okay uh so let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m40s)

[see so number of releases this is just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m43s)

[going to be the release group count this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m45s)

[is going to be the release these group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m47s)

[size then get latest now works great so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m51s)

[worth noting some people like libraries](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m55s)

[like automapper to go between their API](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h32m57s)

[models and their database models um I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m00s)

[prefer to just write my own mapping code](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m04s)

[like I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m07s)

[I the amount of the amount of benefits](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m10s)

[that it saves me compared to the amount](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m13s)

[of time I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m15s)

[write I I can't justify the time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m16s)

[uh let's see so this is release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m21s)

[groups what is this pulling back Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m24s)

[details and channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m27s)

[details uh let's see so this pulls it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m34s)

[back it doesn't need to access any](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m37s)

[children so we can just do that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m39s)

[perfect okay so we were at 61 a minute](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m42s)

[ago how much lower are we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m45s)

[please don't be painful I don't want you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m50s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m51s)

[painful and that doesn't feel horrible I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m55s)

[I I I fully know that there's going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h33m58s)

[be some some major changes because when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m00s)

[people upload a release it's not just a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m03s)

[simple upload like we don't just let](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m05s)

[people upload files and then serve them](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m08s)

[up that sounds bad right it goes through](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m10s)

[uh a CU process and there's some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m14s)

[background processing and all that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m15s)

[stuff uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m18s)

[uh let's see uh supercharge PK you guys](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m22s)

[using stripe uh because I see the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m25s)

[payments folder yes yes stripe is the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m27s)

[the backing one um and we turned on um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m30s)

[quite a few of the stripe features like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m34s)

[the um customer payment portal as well](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m36s)

[like stripe has a very](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m39s)

[nice like they aren't the cheapest](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m41s)

[payment processor but they're trivial to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m45s)

[like I don't want to say trivial they're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m48s)

[very easy to integrate with um they and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m49s)

[depending on how many features you turn](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m53s)

[on they they they take a either a bigger](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m55s)

[cut or a bigger percentage or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h34m58s)

[whatever um in terms of cost and so at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m00s)

[present we were just starting out we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m05s)

[like you know](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m06s)

[what easy to integrate with low time to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m07s)

[Market we're going with that option](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m10s)

[so oh no they're expensive yeah they are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m14s)

[they are quite expensive um the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m16s)

[there 's a couple things that are making](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m19s)

[it a little bit nicer though um so we've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m20s)

[gone through](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m24s)

[uh uh what is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m26s)

[it Founders](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m28s)

[sub so if if anybody is interested like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h35m31s)

[Microsoft](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m04s)

[benefits there's they've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m06s)

[Partners one of which is stripe that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m08s)

[bunch of free credits to get you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m13s)

[starting up and running so our initial](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m15s)

[cost for stripe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m18s)

[we estimate is going to be zero at least](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m20s)

[for the first](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m22s)

[year so they very much have the uh the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m24s)

[drug dealer pricing model of we'll let](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m28s)

[you in really cheap and get you hooked](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m31s)

[you but like the whole and and Azure is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m37s)

[blatantly doing the same thing right if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m40s)

[they give you thousands of dollars in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m42s)

[Azure credits you are probably going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m44s)

[build an Azure and once you've got a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m46s)

[huge investment in Azure you probably](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m49s)

[aren't going to move](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m51s)

[away](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m52s)

[right correct yes that is the exact that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m55s)

[is the exact thing and if you prefer AWS](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h36m58s)

[AWS has a similar program as well it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m02s)

[works in the varies very same way I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m04s)

[haven't gone through it so I can't speak](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m07s)

[to how good it is but I was going to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m08s)

[building on Azure anyway so I was like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m10s)

[free](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m14s)

[credits like yes like you don't need to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m15s)

[like I'm a Microsoft guy so I was I was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m19s)

[already leaning that way anyway and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m22s)

[free credits was like icing on the cake](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m24s)

[I'm like sure let's do that so it is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m26s)

[worth noting the the founders Hub Azure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m29s)

[subscription that they give you isn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m33s)

[quite a normal one and I I don't know](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m34s)

[how to describe it the billing page](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m37s)

[doesn't work you get a redirect link to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m39s)

[Founders Hub BEC](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m42s)

[like I had assumed that they were going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m45s)

[to do this like how they do the msdn](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m47s)

[subscriptions where you just get a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m49s)

[credit on your bill and it goes there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m51s)

[but the msdn ones are different in that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m54s)

[it's like 100 bucks or 15 bucks](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m56s)

[depending on your tier every month and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h37m57s)

[it's reoccurring where this is just a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m00s)

[flat number of credits and it's like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m02s)

[they didn't have a way to plug that into](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m05s)

[the built-in pricing page so they](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m07s)

[redirect you to this other Founders](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m10s)

[subub page where you can look at you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m11s)

[know how much of your credits have you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m13s)

[spent kind of weird I don't know why](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m16s)

[it's done that way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m18s)

[but for reasons it's just and because it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m20s)

[redirects you to a different page it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m24s)

[also makes it difficult if you have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m25s)

[multiple people as part of your Founders](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m27s)

[Hub startup to get to that page but it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m29s)

[like one little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m32s)

[thing so but yeah so that if you're at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h38m34s)

[cool uh let's see download installer so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m29s)

[in this case we are looking for an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m33s)

[installer for a particular package](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m35s)

[ID and why did we have to reach up to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m39s)

[the release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m42s)

[channel oh because we're looking for the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m44s)

[channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m46s)

[name so we want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m47s)

[go release group and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m50s)

[include uh X release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m54s)

[channel so this becomes release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h39m58s)

[and then release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m01s)

[Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m04s)

[okay this really should probably be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m06s)

[Channel either Channel ID or I've been](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m08s)

[using identifier in some cases where I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m11s)

[able to search both but in this case](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m13s)

[channels kind of are name based](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m17s)

[and this uh this endpoint here is in my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m20s)

[public one so it's this is part of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m22s)

[route and so it's string is probably the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m25s)

[most appropriate but I've been changing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m29s)

[some of them to accept either the name](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m31s)

[or the ID and to switch between](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m34s)

[version okay so this is going to be the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h40m59s)

[same thing as I need to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m02s)

[do uh release group then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m03s)

[Channel we want to do release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m13s)

[release Channel and then go up that way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m17s)

[that goes through there let's see so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m20s)

[application releases what are we doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m23s)

[here get manifest so this is the key one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m25s)

[that actually downloads that Json file](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m27s)

[so a few streams back I did a a thing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m31s)

[covering kind of velop Pac and how it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m33s)

[publishes so it generates a Json file](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m35s)

[which is a manifest that outlines all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m38s)

[your releases we generate that on our](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m40s)

[hosted](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m42s)

[service um so in this case it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m43s)

[is uh uh release Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h41m48s)

[higher um okay so let's see so I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h42m13s)

[think I think this is another case where](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h42m17s)

[we probably just need to go up a layer](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h42m19s)

[but I I think we can actually get away](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h42m23s)

[with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h42m25s)

[doing uh release group release Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h42m26s)

[what does it need off of the team it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m38s)

[needs the subscription plan the stripe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m41s)

[subscription um so that it can build up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m44s)

[the payment](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m46s)

[status and then then it goes looking at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m47s)

[projects it pulls the team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m51s)

[users uh projects get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m55s)

[project project latest release created](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h45m58s)

[at so it's only wanting to create latest](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m02s)

[so it really only needs to release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m04s)

[groups at that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m05s)

[point so it only needs it for that so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m08s)

[this really can just be release groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m10s)

[and we can stop there we don't need the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m12s)

[releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m13s)

[anymore right so I don't think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m14s)

[yeah we aren't using dot releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m20s)

[anywhere else in here so that goes away](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m22s)

[that's done team methods is done data](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m24s)

[Factory now we're in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m26s)

[test oh yes this is both a blessing and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m28s)

[a curse to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m32s)

[me okay so we are creating a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m33s)

[grou so this method here you can see has](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m37s)

[02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:48,319](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m41s)

references um

[so question do you use the EF core for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m45s)

[everything we recently refactored uh EF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m48s)

[core and included Dapper our building](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m51s)

[blocks are now using Dapper for faster](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m54s)

[queries and EF core as our unit of work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m55s)

[uh so for this I am just using EF core](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h46m59s)

[though um leveraging](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m03s)

[Dapper is certainly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m07s)

[appealing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m10s)

[um it is definitely appealing um Mark](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m12s)

[renovich I'm probably butchering his](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m16s)

[last name](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m18s)

[uh VP of azure I think uh he was asked](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m20s)

[at I think it was either ignite or one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m24s)

[of the build conferences what he thought](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m26s)

[one of the next big things was going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m29s)

[be you know excluding AI um and Dapper](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m30s)

[was his answer of this is the way people](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m34s)

[are going to start building Cloud native](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m36s)

[applications uh where you've got kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m39s)

[these building blocks where you can bolt](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m41s)

[stuff uh bolt stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m43s)

[on but at present this is just EF](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m47s)

[core uh partly because this was mostly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m51s)

[around quick uh quick shipping is what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m55s)

[we were going for but there is going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h47m59s)

[be a desire to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m01s)

[um push more to that like right now my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m05s)

[infrastructure is all infrastructure is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m08s)

[coded in terraform and like I don't have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m09s)

[a Dev environment I've got prod and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m13s)

[local and that's it the one cool thing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m15s)

[though is this is using net Aspire so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m17s)

[once we get compiling I can hit F5 and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m21s)

[have everything](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m24s)

[running I got my API I get my front end](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m26s)

[I get all of my back uh yeah Aspire is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m29s)

[Hidden Gem yeah it is awesome right like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m34s)

[I I I took it to them like I've been](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m38s)

[having so much fun with it because I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m41s)

[got a couple background processors that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m43s)

[process um data gets that gets thrown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m46s)

[into a queue and right now I'm just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m49s)

[using Azure storage account cues at some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m50s)

[point probably a service bus so that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m53s)

[get um like dead letter similar because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m56s)

[I kind of have my own little dead](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h48m59s)

[lettering because I didn't want to spend](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m01s)

[a bunch more infrastructure when I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m02s)

[didn't need to so it there there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m04s)

[things on here that were done quick and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m06s)

[dirty like for certain but I even went](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m08s)

[as far as to go ahead and say you know](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m11s)

[what as part of my Aspire host I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m13s)

[actually just spin up Stripes uh web](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m16s)

[hook so that as long as I've got the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m19s)

[stripe CLI installed and I've logged](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m22s)

[into it I can I can have my Aspire host](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m24s)

[fire up the web hook so that I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m28s)

[actually test my payment stuff against](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m30s)

[the um stripe call it development or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m32s)

[test what their their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m36s)

[sandbox um to be able to test payments](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m38s)

[which is awesome like F5 I got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m41s)

[everything going it's wonderful and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m43s)

[all the build stuff the only thing I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m46s)

[not using a Spire for is I rolled my own](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m48s)

[terraform cuz I wanted a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m51s)

[more I wanted more control over the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m54s)

[infrastructure that was getting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m56s)

[generated I didn't fully trust it but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h49m57s)

[I've also been running Aspire](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m01s)

[since I think beta 1 beta 2 like I I had](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m04s)

[it early and dove in head](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m09s)

[first uh let's see uh group 1.](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m22s)

[uh hour two I've have learned that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m24s)

[cannot have light mode dark mode Splash](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m26s)

[screens](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m32s)

[uh oh stripe mock from Docker in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m35s)

[beginning oh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m37s)

[interesting see I was not aware of that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m39s)

[I assume that's out on darker hub](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m42s)

[uh please use this guy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h50m55s)

[okay oh this is pretty cool I didn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m03s)

[even know about this thank you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m07s)

[supercharge based on the real stripe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m13s)

[API and I assume](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m16s)

[I mean updated yesterday so that like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m20s)

[okay because I know stripe revs](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m24s)

[there they they rev their API fairly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m26s)

[consistently because I've already been](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m29s)

[bit by that with the the versioning of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m30s)

[it it's a game changer oh yeah I believe](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m32s)

[it this will be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m35s)

[nice this will be really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m37s)

[nice okay one this is getting a star for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m40s)

[starters and it is going over here on my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m43s)

[on my two read list yeah this will be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m49s)

[nice because I'll just pull that in that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m52s)

[is sweet thank](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m54s)

[you uh Pikachu](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h51m57s)

[I I believe you're correct but it also](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m00s)

[depends on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m04s)

[how](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m06s)

[so I'm not recommending this but I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m08s)

[believe you you can kind of cheat right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m11s)

[because you've got the splash screen](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m14s)

[from the OS right that's the pop up and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m15s)

[that one I I believe you're correct on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m19s)

[however you can fake it as well if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m21s)

[create a page you can if the if your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m24s)

[startup is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m28s)

[quick you can create a page and put it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m29s)

[up and then uh and then it's whatever](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m32s)

[you want to put on the page and then you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m36s)

[can control it that's why sometimes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m37s)

[you'll see people uh people's mobile](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m39s)

[apps where you'll see like that static](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m42s)

[image come up and then it'll switch to a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m44s)

[moving image](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m47s)

[and it and all they've done is they've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m49s)

[swapped from the os's um or the app](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m50s)

[provided splash screen which is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m53s)

[basically an image to a a real screen in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m56s)

[their app where they do a bunch of uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h52m59s)

[stuff behind the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m02s)

[scenes uh about disabling and then doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m04s)

[a mock page it's very much not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m07s)

[recommended yeah it like it's only a way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m08s)

[to get around it when your app has to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m11s)

[processing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m16s)

[and it's it's basically your app wanting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m19s)

[to throw up a loading screen not a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m23s)

[splash screen and I think that's the key](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m25s)

[separation is the difference between](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m26s)

[when you would use a loading screen for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m28s)

[something versus a splash screen for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m30s)

[something uh let's see I want to create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m33s)

[me a new method down here because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m35s)

[I uh let's see release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m38s)

[group create release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m41s)

[group CU this Factory I use for all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m45s)

[my test just to be able to spin stuff up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m49s)

[yeah and I'm sure you're unhappy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m53s)

[nope don't hate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m55s)

[me uh hold on why are you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h53m58s)

[squawking oh because I didn't populate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m01s)

[the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m04s)

[versions so yeah required members not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m06s)

[set that's a problem what else did I put](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m09s)

[on here I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m12s)

[remember uh size created at last](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m13s)

[modified](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m17s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m19s)

[size and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m23s)

[then the other one we didn't do the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m25s)

[created](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m28s)

[at wait namespace cannot](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m32s)

[oh yeah okay so now we get there so now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m40s)

[we do here we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m43s)

[do create release group because I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m44s)

[want to think too hard](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m47s)

[and then we get rid of all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m50s)

[this yeah and then we do so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h54m56s)

[going to actually come up here and we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m01s)

[going to put it in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m03s)

[channel uh let's see this is totally](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m05s)

[going to break some stuff uh let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m08s)

[release groups contains group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m11s)

[1.0 and then this thing down here is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m14s)

[going to be group one 1.0 releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m17s)

[add right and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m20s)

[do group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m23s)

[1.1 uh group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m29s)

[1.0 and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m33s)

[do 1.0 and then this is basically going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m36s)

[to be the same exact thing that we did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m39s)

[here and actually we should probably do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m44s)

[it on both just to make make sure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m46s)

[that wa hang on let's do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m51s)

[this group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m55s)

[1.0 just to be because I don't want if](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h55m58s)

[this method changes its implementation I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m01s)

[don't want to be dependent on its](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m03s)

[implementation internally up here I want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m05s)

[them to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m08s)

[operate oh thought I was being clever](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m10s)

[not as clever as I thought okay we'll do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m14s)

[that we'll do that that makes that work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m16s)

[work and then this needs to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m18s)

[101 then down here this becomes group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m22s)

[101 and then this becomes group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m26s)

[101 okay that handles that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m30s)

[build see what we have left I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m34s)

[we're getting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m42s)

[closer I kind of want to just dismiss](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m43s)

[all go away](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m47s)

[I have this habitual thing whenever I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m48s)

[see the little notification Bell in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m50s)

[Visual Studio I must click on it and I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m52s)

[must install all updates immediately](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m55s)

[it's very very important you shouldn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m56s)

[do that but it's very very important to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h56m59s)

[me I it doesn't help that when you were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m03s)

[on preview builds you do this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m06s)

[consistently okay so that now we are in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m08s)

[the upload](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m10s)

[service so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m12s)

[where we're going to come back to this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m15s)

[because this is where extra stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m18s)

[happens and I don't want to think about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m20s)

[it right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m22s)

[now um let's see here endpoint](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m23s)

[test uh let's see release groups so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m28s)

[which test in particular get project by](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m32s)

[project ID returns project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m35s)

[details yeah this seems fine I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m41s)

[what I do want to change though up on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m46s)

[this data](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m47s)

[Factory I think I want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m52s)

[change how work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h57m56s)

[like I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m00s)

[do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m02s)

[uh group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m04s)

[1.0 do siiz](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m06s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m13s)

[actually I'm going to do a method down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m15s)

[here just just going to do a little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m17s)

[method static](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m18s)

[void uh calculate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m21s)

[group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m27s)

[values it's late I can't think of a good](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m30s)

[name but now down in here I can do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m33s)

[release group. siiz gets releas group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m37s)

[dot uh releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m41s)

[some that way I don't that way I don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m45s)

[have to set it then release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m47s)

[uh let's do that there anything else in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m54s)

[here that was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h58m58s)

[calculated no I think those are fine so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m01s)

[I think I just I want this thing to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m04s)

[somewhat](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m06s)

[realistic we're going to do count group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m08s)

[values group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m11s)

[100 thank you co-pilot you are awesome I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m14s)

[appreciate appreciate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m17s)

[it there we go okay so that builds that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m21s)

[up that builds that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m24s)

[up okay and now if I go back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m25s)

[here this is the project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m33s)

[details should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m43s)

[be okay so it's valid ating that the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m46s)

[current bytes of the project is the sum](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m48s)

[of the release groups and not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m51s)

[zero](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m53s)

[good okay the next one uh let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=02h59m55s)

[see create user create release create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m01s)

[channel create project add Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m04s)

[create team do all of this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m06s)

[work what are we testing here delete](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m09s)

[project deletes project and related](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m12s)

[data this must have been before I did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m16s)

[the uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m20s)

[create wait because this we've got the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m28s)

[data Factor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m30s)

[yeah great full team isn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m34s)

[it is it called I have the the method we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m37s)

[just did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m41s)

[complete great complete team yeah so I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m45s)

[think we can just do VAR team because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m49s)

[there's nothing special here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m53s)

[it context users we don't need the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m56s)

[release we don't need the channel don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h00m59s)

[need the releases in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m02s)

[channel we don't need the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m04s)

[project we don't need to set those up we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m07s)

[don't need to set that link](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m09s)

[up we have the team now we do need to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m11s)

[add the users we don't need to add the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m14s)

[project we do need to add the team to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m16s)

[the context and we need to save the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m19s)

[context changes we do need to do one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m20s)

[more thing in here where we do have to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m24s)

[set project gets team project but where](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m26s)

[is this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m29s)

[used there so that's important where is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m30s)

[Channel referenced down there so we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m32s)

[should do that so channel gets project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m34s)

[Channel Subzero](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m37s)

[right because this is just validating](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m41s)

[that they actually did get re deleted](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m44s)

[um we should probably add](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m49s)

[in uh release group in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m52s)

[here just just because to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h01m59s)

[complete and then we'll come down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m02s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m06s)

[see a release wasn't being set was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m09s)

[it I think I was doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m13s)

[this yeah some of these tests are from I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m16s)

[I was figuring some patterns out and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m19s)

[some of mine are old I think I favor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m22s)

[this now slightly more is just suppress](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m25s)

[it because this is a unit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m28s)

[test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m31s)

[uh ah so how how did you test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m38s)

[authentication ah great question one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m40s)

[second I'll show](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m42s)

[you that I I think there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m45s)

[let me look look I if I remember correct](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m53s)

[ASP](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m54s)

[core I think they actually have a sample](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h02m56s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m03s)

[see uh that's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m07s)

[it yeah this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m11s)

[thing this guy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m13s)

[here uh where is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m15s)

[is this guy yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m22s)

[functionally so there there's a couple](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m24s)

[pieces that go into it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m26s)

[and show it to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m29s)

[you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m31s)

[the and it comes down to you don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m33s)

[actually fully test everything because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m36s)

[certain things are difficult to test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m38s)

[right so one I am using the web](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m42s)

[application Factory this is the The Base](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m44s)

[Class provided by Microsoft so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m46s)

[the MVC testing uh nougat](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m48s)

[package but I commonly create my own](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m52s)

[derived class and then reference that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m55s)

[because I want my own derive class to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m58s)

[kind of do special stuff right and so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h03m59s)

[like when you see me using that NDB](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m03s)

[scope it's because I want to make sure I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m05s)

[get a separate context and so that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m07s)

[don't get that EF sharing and cache data](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m09s)

[problem biting me so I intentionally](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m13s)

[create Scopes and get context in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m15s)

[different Scopes and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m17s)

[but then I do this with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m19s)

[authentication um idea in here where I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m21s)

[set up a authenticated user or I uh can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m25s)

[strip out authentication by just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m29s)

[clearing the call back so I just have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m31s)

[the um a private Funk sitting here that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m34s)

[gives me a little bit more control if I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m37s)

[want to tweak it but then I've got some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m39s)

[standard setups of what most of my stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m42s)

[might end up doing um and then the uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m45s)

[the key change in the web application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m49s)

[Factory](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m51s)

[is these guys here so the web](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m53s)

[application factories configure Services](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h04m58s)

[runs after your main uh web API](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m00s)

[configure services so anything you do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m04s)

[here is on top of your actual service so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m06s)

[everything here is replacing stuff that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m10s)

[is in the real service with something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m12s)

[else so ideally you want this as small](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m14s)

[as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m18s)

[possible um that's not actually overly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m19s)

[possible for me so I've got a q](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m23s)

[processing and other stuff kind of built](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m25s)

[in here to simulate out some of this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m27s)

[stuff like even the stripe service which](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m29s)

[apparently I can now kill off and run](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m31s)

[that um I do not believe in unit testing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m34s)

[controllers because in your um and it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m38s)

[I'm using minimal apis but the same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m43s)

[thing applies there when you unit test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m45s)

[the controller you're testing it under a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m47s)

[situation that doesn't exist in prod and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m49s)

[I don't like that um it also means that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m52s)

[you bypass testing all of like your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m54s)

[middleware so I very much favor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m57s)

[controllers using web application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h05m59s)

[Factory to verify that you've got your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m01s)

[route set up that the DI is set up to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m03s)

[resolve all of those dependencies to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m05s)

[make sure that startup Works um and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m07s)

[because you're doing this extra stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m11s)

[here I'm only like 80% confident my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m13s)

[startup works because it's possible that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m16s)

[I've missed a dependency in my main one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m18s)

[that I've injected here and those types](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m20s)

[of bugs do slip by right but you add in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m23s)

[this authentication with this um uh this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m26s)

[test off Handler and this is the whole](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m30s)

[reason for that call back is because I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m33s)

[then have a way of going through and I I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m36s)

[create this little user context class](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m39s)

[that calls into my call back which](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m42s)

[right you want to muck with and test out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m50s)

[what happens when I have claim a but not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h06m52s)

[up that I like but there's because these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m05s)

[are classes that are completely in your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m09s)

[that authenticate async it's really just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m15s)

[being called from this authentication](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m17s)

[Factory caches it and then just calls](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m25s)

[back into it and the only reason it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m27s)

[calls back into the web application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m30s)

[Factory is to access that delegate that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m32s)

[is being stored there right and that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m35s)

[that's literally all there is to it so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m38s)

[it doesn't test the real off like it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m40s)

[really hard to test the real off](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m44s)

[especially if you've got like an Off 2](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m46s)

[you're looking to test a um a front-end](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h07m57s)

[web test is probably a better test to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m00s)

[cover that but I test all of my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m04s)

[even a manual test hitting your loged](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m11s)

[page verifies the the happy path and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m14s)

[after that I'm I'm pretty confident](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m18s)

[everything's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m20s)

[working because there's there's not a a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m21s)

[there's not very many categories of bugs](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m24s)

[that slip](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m26s)

[past uh let's see okay so I was doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m30s)

[this cool I'm going to try it thanks man](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m33s)

[yeah no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m34s)

[problem yeah secretly like this project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m36s)

[is a kind of a a side gig for me to to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m41s)

[go through and and do all of this but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m44s)

[the the Lessons Learned here I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m47s)

[applied in a lot of different other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m48s)

[areas so it works outs out rather](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m50s)

[nice okay so we're going to do release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m54s)

[groups and we want the release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h08m57s)

[ID yeah so I've been doing this where I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m02s)

[just suppressed the null warning here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m04s)

[because the null ability analyzer can't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m07s)

[validate that by the time I'm using it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m09s)

[this delegate has actually been](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m11s)

[invoked but I'm the developer I know](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m15s)

[that this will be invoked so I just tell](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m18s)

[the thing to shut up that's basically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m20s)

[all we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m23s)

[do okay so what are we doing here now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m24s)

[that I know that some of these things](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m27s)

[this is once again creating a user](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m29s)

[creating a release creating a channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m30s)

[creating a project creating a team this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m32s)

[is a lot of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m34s)

[work for what really should be team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m35s)

[create complete team right that's why I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m40s)

[have that method because so much of my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m42s)

[stuff requires doing this garbage](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m44s)

[then I don't need to do this so let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m51s)

[see when user is not part of owning team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m55s)

[so I intentionally do not want to add](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h09m58s)

[the user to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m00s)

[team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m02s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m03s)

[is explicitly the case that we don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m05s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m08s)

[do okay so what are we doing here get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m10s)

[channel uh hold on why do I have get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m14s)

[channel oh this is release Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m18s)

[endpoint got it okay so let's see so get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m23s)

[channel returns Channel details okay so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m28s)

[I'm just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m31s)

[validating the channel details release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m35s)

[groups should have a count of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m37s)

[three uh let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m40s)

[see and actually should this have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m43s)

[this is using Create complete team so it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m48s)

[is making the assumption that there are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m51s)

[there should only actually be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m54s)

[two this is this is a bit of a PO test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h10m57s)

[but let's see what I was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m01s)

[doing uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m03s)

[channel uh release group Sub](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m06s)

[Zero rename this release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m10s)

[group let's see so this was pulling out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m14s)

[the channel from the release groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m17s)

[pulling the first one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m20s)

[out uh should have element at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m22s)

[zero and this really should be release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m30s)

[group and then that doesn't exist I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m35s)

[think release group is going to give me](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m40s)

[a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m42s)

[problem because I do not have a using up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m43s)

[here for it so it's going to be a name](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m47s)

[Collision release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m51s)

[group boom we do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m54s)

[that that fixes the first one there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h11m58s)

[nothing else we want to test on this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m01s)

[right because we're testing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m02s)

[version yeah created at is irrelevant we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m05s)

[don't actually care because it's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m09s)

[surfacing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m10s)

[anywhere okay and then this is Once](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m12s)

[Again release groups and then this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m14s)

[becomes release groups and then this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m17s)

[becomes release groups anytime you want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m20s)

[to chime in co-pilot you just you just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m23s)

[go right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m25s)

[ahead you go right on ahead and and feel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m27s)

[free to help me whenever you'd](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m30s)

[like uh let's see that goes there about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m33s)

[time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m35s)

[co-pilot been waiting for you what do I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m37s)

[want to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m40s)

[here still can't figure out okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m41s)

[thanks uh you know this one yet](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m44s)

[not like I've been making the same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m48s)

[changes over and over okay and then we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m49s)

[don't need the enu mapping stuff that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m52s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m54s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m55s)

[great okay let's go down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m57s)

[here in case anybody knows how I'm doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h12m59s)

[this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m02s)

[the um little little bitty red thing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m03s)

[right oh wait it's not that hang](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m07s)

[on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m11s)

[it alt no shift what is it control there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m12s)

[we go control shift they I can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m18s)

[eventually figure out how to draw](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m20s)

[arrows uh let's see here so what do we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m22s)

[got we got delete channel deletes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m24s)

[Channel and related](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m26s)

[data okay this is used in the complete](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m28s)

[team one great pulls the channel out and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m31s)

[so we are trying to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m34s)

[validate that all of the application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m37s)

[ones I think what we want to actually do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m40s)

[here is uh grab the group as well](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m42s)

[release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m46s)

[and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m49s)

[then team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m52s)

[projects](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m55s)

[channels and then I think we do release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m56s)

[group it's channels release group and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h13m59s)

[then we go here and we go with release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m02s)

[group hold](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m07s)

[on and then this should be release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m09s)

[ID and we need one more of these guys in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m13s)

[the middle](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m16s)

[between these two release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m18s)

[groups then this just becomes ID equals](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m21s)

[release group ID make sure those are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m25s)

[deleted](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m28s)

[great next](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m29s)

[up internal endpoint](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m34s)

[test okay so what are we doing get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m38s)

[release returns release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m40s)

[details uh uh yep so this just really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m45s)

[needs to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m49s)

[be release groups Subzero because this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m50s)

[is complete team great great great make](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m53s)

[sure all the details come back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m55s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h14m58s)

[okay this groups Subzero and normally](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m01s)

[just to be clear this kind of code is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m04s)

[crap right hardcoded indexes bad bad bad](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m07s)

[bad bad like this is a recipe for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m11s)

[disaster but in this case it's a unit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m13s)

[test and if it doesn't exist exist I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m15s)

[actually want an uh an exception thrown](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m17s)

[so if you want exceptions code like this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m20s)

[and in this case I want exceptions so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m24s)

[we're going to get away with it for now](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m27s)

[but remember because these are tests and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m29s)

[I want my test to blow up if there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m33s)

[problems I'm kind of okay with letting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m34s)

[them blow up when there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m37s)

[problems but it is but this kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m41s)

[coding is is a recipe for problems](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m43s)

[there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m54s)

[there anytime you want to chime in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h15m57s)

[co-pilot anytime you want to chime in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m00s)

[would be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m02s)

[great least these ones are easy okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m07s)

[that handles all the ones in that file](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m11s)

[moving](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m13s)

[down lease endpoint tests](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m14s)

[okay so what are we doing here the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m18s)

[download installer with valid data](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m19s)

[returns](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m21s)

[redirect okay so the idea here is when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m22s)

[you hit our our API to download one of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m25s)

[the uh installers we are hosting the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m28s)

[installers inside of a storage account](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m32s)

[so what actually gets returned back to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m34s)

[you when you hit the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m36s)

[API um is we generate up uh a URL to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m37s)

[storage account but with a uh a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m42s)

[timestamped SAS token on it so you'll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m45s)

[get back a download link in an HTTP 302](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m49s)

[which things like HTTP client on our our](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m53s)

[client SDK or browser similar will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m57s)

[follow that link and then just pull down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h16m59s)

[the file and as long as you do it in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m02s)

[whatever the configured Tim stamp is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m04s)

[it's you have to hit it in like the next](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m06s)

[30 minutes or something we it's fairly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m08s)

[generous but if you try to save the link](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m11s)

[it it'll die](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m14s)

[okay so this is quering application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m20s)

[releases it's pulling back the release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m22s)

[Channel why does it need the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m25s)

[channel it needs the channel because it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m29s)

[wants to get the channel name okay so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m32s)

[this we just need to then go up the food](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m35s)

[chain uh then include release Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m38s)

[this then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m43s)

[becomes release group group relas](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m45s)

[channel name](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m48s)

[great goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m49s)

[there I think this is probably the same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m51s)

[thing yeah this is just going up the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h17m57s)

[food chain and these are just kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m00s)

[test so I don't actually care too much](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m03s)

[if I have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m06s)

[to do this too many](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m07s)

[times so let's do release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m11s)

[group release channel that pulls that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m14s)

[back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m17s)

[great uh let's see same deal on all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m18s)

[these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m21s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m26s)

[group pleas Channel sorry my big fat](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m28s)

[head is in the way while we're doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m31s)

[this I'll just I'll be on this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m33s)

[side okay and then this one here so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m38s)

[ensure release a sink](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m43s)

[what is this doing this is querying from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m48s)

[the application releases with a version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m51s)

[where the type matches and pulling it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m54s)

[back if the one that came back is null](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h18m57s)

[it creates a new](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m00s)

[one and adds it to the context so it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m03s)

[ensures that a particular release exists](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m06s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m09s)

[database and this is called by one of my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m11s)

[helper methods that is used multiple](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m13s)

[times over got it okay so down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m16s)

[here we want to create the application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m23s)

[release but we also want to sort of do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m29s)

[the same thing is we want to validate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m33s)

[that if the application release is null](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m37s)

[and we're about to add it we want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m40s)

[find the relevant group so we want to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m42s)

[release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m45s)

[these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m48s)

[group uh gets await context release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h19m51s)

[groups trying to decide how much I care](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m00s)

[because this isn't filtering by like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m04s)

[user or any of that stuff and I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m06s)

[that's probably okay tempted to to add a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m09s)

[version of this with version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m13s)

[yeah I'm tempted so this this basically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m18s)

[just tacks on an extra EF query because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m20s)

[remember version is a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m23s)

[individual values and it follows the the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m26s)

[nougat semantic versioning R you've got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m31s)

[three um like dot numbers and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m34s)

[you've got a optional Alpha string on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m38s)

[the end so when you see like preview n](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m41s)

[get packages with hyphen Ci or something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m43s)

[on on the end of it right all that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m46s)

[doing is tacking on a string onto the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m48s)

[end which makes it a preview](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m50s)

[release but this thing is doing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m52s)

[something](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m54s)

[similar um and so I think I just want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m55s)

[duplicate this and then I want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h20m59s)

[do Le groups the key thing here is this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m03s)

[is a queriable and returning back a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m06s)

[query so these wear statements are not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m08s)

[the same as a wear statement that you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m11s)

[might use on a list or an array these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m12s)

[are uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m15s)

[Expressions you can kind of see here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m18s)

[right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m21s)

[expression not deligate and expressions](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m22s)

[may be evaluated like in this case um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m27s)

[the EF provider will parse the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m31s)

[expression and convert that into a SQL](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m33s)

[string or the the code taking in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m35s)

[expression could compile it and get the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m38s)

[delegate out or both and not mut you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m40s)

[exclusive okay so that gets us that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m45s)

[which means now down here I can do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m48s)

[release groups and basically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m49s)

[duplicate something kind of similar to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m53s)

[what what we did before right is we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m55s)

[going to end up with something like this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h21m58s)

[and then we can do first or default](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m01s)

[async right and this is goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m04s)

[nullable and then if we're we're kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m07s)

[going to end up doing the same same kind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m10s)

[of doohickey](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m12s)

[here uh um let's see what is the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m15s)

[size yeah we're going to we we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m19s)

[hardcoding the size here and here so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m21s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m23s)

[fine uh actually what we might do here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m25s)

[we might just do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m30s)

[this uh okay you're going to be unhappy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m33s)

[because size is required we'll start the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m35s)

[size at zero uh this then goes into that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m37s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m41s)

[group becomes really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m43s)

[release group then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m46s)

[this and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m49s)

[then is this just finds it this creates](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m51s)

[it we don't want to save changes but I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m54s)

[do want to do uh release group.](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h22m56s)

[size plus equals application release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m01s)

[size that way it adds up appropriately](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m03s)

[that makes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m07s)

[sense okay I really want to get the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m10s)

[thing compiling so I can run the test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m12s)

[and see how badly I've broken](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m14s)

[stuff okay close some of these tabs I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m18s)

[got too much I'm looking at get Team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m21s)

[without releases returns zero used](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m23s)

[bite okay uh let's see this is getting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m27s)

[the application](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m31s)

[releases and we want to strip all of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m34s)

[them out so we we're basically just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m37s)

[looking for all of the applications from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m39s)

[anywhere that are tied to this team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m42s)

[so this is simple we just need to go up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m46s)

[up through the release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m50s)

[group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m53s)

[no then through the channel then through](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m55s)

[the project then to the team right easy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h23m57s)

[mode and then go down to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m00s)

[here let's see so this is delete team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m03s)

[deletes team and related data yeah so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m06s)

[this is another case where I I think we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m09s)

[need to do a data release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m11s)

[leas](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m16s)

[group pull that back and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m17s)

[then this is going to be release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m21s)

[group this becomes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m25s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m28s)

[group holds that back and then down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m30s)

[here somewhere between here and here we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m33s)

[do release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m37s)

[groups uh release group ID](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m40s)

[great that handles that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m43s)

[okay so what is this uh get used bytes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m52s)

[returns team's total](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h24m55s)

[size okay so this was very explicitly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m01s)

[not using the other one so that we could](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m04s)

[control](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m06s)

[it okay so what do we got here we've got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m08s)

[Channel 1 a channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m11s)

[1B which](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m12s)

[are these guys guys here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m14s)

[right because the idea was we were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m21s)

[simulating](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m23s)

[uh separate uh channels per project so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m26s)

[the one denotes the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m29s)

[project right and then channel two is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m33s)

[for project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m37s)

[two right there versus project one there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m38s)

[and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m42s)

[there okay and then we create release is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m43s)

[inside of each of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m46s)

[these and create release is just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m49s)

[leveraging the same thing so it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m52s)

[basically going to have the same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m54s)

[version I think what we want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h25m57s)

[do is this is 1B](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m02s)

[1B I think we just want to make so these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m07s)

[ones both we want a release Group bar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m10s)

[let's see release group one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m13s)

[get create release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m17s)

[group right and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m20s)

[then this becomes uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m24s)

[context release groups add release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m28s)

[groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m30s)

[one and let's see release Group One](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m33s)

[release channel gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m35s)

[one a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m39s)

[because these both go into one a which](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m47s)

[means they both go into release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m52s)

[one this goes into release Group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m53s)

[One release Group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h26m57s)

[One release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m02s)

[group and I'm thinking release group one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m04s)

[should actually be 1 a just for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m07s)

[symmetry right so that handles](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m10s)

[those we want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m13s)

[we want release Group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m17s)

[B here one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m20s)

[B 1B 1B](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m24s)

[1B and then this becomes release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m29s)

[release group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m34s)

[1B goes into there that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m35s)

[works none of them are in Channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m43s)

[two got it because I wanted to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m47s)

[separate those](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m51s)

[out got it so this becomes release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h27m59s)

[group release group 1B](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m03s)

[okay got it okay so that one should be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m11s)

[handled it's a fairly simple one of just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m14s)

[making sure o is that the end that's the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m17s)

[end of my scroll bar does it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m20s)

[fit come on compile](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m44s)

[the running joke goes compilation first](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m47s)

[unit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m49s)

[test so close oh I didn't I did skip](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m52s)

[over](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m56s)

[some right because I did skip over the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h28m57s)

[processing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m00s)

[tests which we're going to have to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m02s)

[we're going to have to do battle with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m04s)

[here in a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m05s)

[second okay but we're down to only four](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m06s)

[errors okay so one of these is going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m10s)

[be the processing service and one of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m12s)

[them is going to be the test yeah okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m13s)

[okay so processing service so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m17s)

[one of the things that goes through when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m19s)

[a user first uploads one of their uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m21s)

[installers uh that was created with the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m25s)

[SDK which is great and as part of this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m27s)

[by the time we've reached this point](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m30s)

[we've already validated all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m32s)

[authentication so the last bit here and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m35s)

[at this point we've also validated that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m38s)

[the file is good right it passes our](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m40s)

[parsing it scans appropriately we're not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m43s)

[worried about malware or anything at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m45s)

[this point with it this is just okay the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m47s)

[file's been uploaded the file has been](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m49s)

[processed we've moved it into the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m51s)

[appropriate place in our storage account](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m52s)

[now we need to create database records](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m55s)

[so that it actually like shows up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h29m57s)

[properly so it in short it is moved from](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m00s)

[a file upload object to a real release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m04s)

[object and as part of doing this we have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m08s)

[to spin some stuff and so we will if you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m11s)

[upload a brand new thing we will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m16s)

[actually go as far as to create a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m19s)

[project for you if it's a brand new](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m20s)

[package ID the big idea here is we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m23s)

[wanted a nice simple demo that you can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m25s)

[run net publish and have a really slick](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m28s)

[zero to up and running with just net](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m32s)

[publish which is pretty cool Works kind](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m36s)

[of nice but that does mean we come down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m40s)

[here and I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m44s)

[this one knows that it's able to create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m48s)

[the application release but I think what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m50s)

[we need to do here is we actually need](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m53s)

[to do release group release group gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h30m55s)

[await context release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m01s)

[groups uh and actually we can](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m04s)

[do with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m08s)

[version I wonder why we uh I wonder why](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m13s)

[we don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m16s)

[have well let's break this up let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m19s)

[break this up uh let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m22s)

[major version minor semantic vers I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m26s)

[just kind of wondering if this should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m29s)

[be in an extension down in that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m32s)

[extension](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m35s)

[method](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m36s)

[at Mantic version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m38s)

[release okay and then you are probably](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m44s)

[unhappy because that's a nullable thingy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m46s)

[a bobber and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m49s)

[if no if release group is null you want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m51s)

[to spin a new one release group gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h31m56s)

[new NOP stop helping me stop helping](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m02s)

[me stop it size gets](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m06s)

[zero right so that's going to go there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m10s)

[and then we're going to come down here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m13s)

[and we're going to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m15s)

[that and what is your problem now you](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m17s)

[probably want the version yeah so major](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m18s)

[version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m21s)

[gets Mantic version major do the rest of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m27s)

[them for me minor patch release okay so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m30s)

[that handles](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m34s)

[that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m36s)

[think anything else I needed to set](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m38s)

[major minor release size handled for me](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m41s)

[handled for me I need to set the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m44s)

[channel so release channel gets release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m47s)

[Channel okay and then this gets to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m51s)

[release group this gets to be hang](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m54s)

[on got it this is actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h32m59s)

[release group ID and this is release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m02s)

[group because we may or may not have a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m06s)

[valid instance to play](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m09s)

[with and then when we are adding up to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m11s)

[here what we what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m16s)

[recalculate um the size on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m19s)

[it and then the rest of the calculated](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m23s)

[things will hand be handled](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m26s)

[automatically right now on these tests](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m30s)

[we want to make sure that we capture](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m33s)

[that size addition because that's going](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m35s)

[to be a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m36s)

[very key thing to double check on this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m37s)

[okay so where are we so what are we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m46s)

[doing here we are verifying and this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m48s)

[process message with new package creates](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m52s)

[records uh so this is just really needs](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m56s)

[to be release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h33m58s)

[groups that include releases](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m00s)

[okay so we want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m04s)

[do uh release groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m11s)

[and so we actually want to validate this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m16s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m18s)

[groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m20s)

[uh and then we do want to do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m22s)

[this and but this actually goes down](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m26s)

[here and then this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m28s)

[becomes release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m31s)

[group and honestly I am a bit torn about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m35s)

[doing something like this versus just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m37s)

[doing Dot single here right it's just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m39s)

[that this gives a nice air message on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m43s)

[failure okay now that we've covered that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m50s)

[appropriately uh let's see so release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m53s)

[group uh major](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h34m57s)

[version uh let's see so we we basically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m01s)

[want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m04s)

[this because that is the version that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m05s)

[going to get set from the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m08s)

[package we want that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m12s)

[and then we want the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m16s)

[size tested as well releas group.](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m18s)

[siiz uh should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m24s)

[be in 24 I'm just looking at the release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m26s)

[down below because this is a brand new](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m29s)

[one because it's with new package so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m31s)

[this is the we're going to hit the null](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m33s)

[case on all of those and spin up all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m35s)

[records it's kind of hard to simulate a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m39s)

[case where some of the records are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m42s)

[created like project existing is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m44s)

[possible but a lot of these objects like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m50s)

[Channel don't the user doesn't create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m51s)

[per se they get created for them as they](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m55s)

[published um artifacts that reference](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h35m58s)

[them because they're really just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m03s)

[organizational](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m05s)

[units okay so that handles](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m07s)

[there now we're going to do the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m11s)

[um the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m16s)

[existing uh project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m18s)

[case so let's see so this actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m21s)

[creates a project creates a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m25s)

[release should this be using the create](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m29s)

[full just trying to look and see what's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m34s)

[going on here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m36s)

[um might but it's doing something a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m47s)

[little](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m50s)

[different so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m51s)

[let's not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m53s)

[yet okay so that'll get me there this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h36m56s)

[just needs to be in a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m00s)

[group that goes in a release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m02s)

[group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m08s)

[okay kind of want wondering](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m13s)

[if I I feel the urge to set the versions](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m22s)

[here I'm also flat out impress that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m28s)

[co-pilot knew that because of this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m31s)

[version down here maybe it was the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m33s)

[assertions that it knew what it needed](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m35s)

[to put there that's that's kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m37s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m40s)

[um is this is going return that as the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m43s)

[vers well hold on this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m47s)

[is yeah I mean that's the version that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m53s)

[the group needs to be in but then the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m56s)

[existing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h37m59s)

[release kind of needs the same thing but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m01s)

[we kind of want this to be a because](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m05s)

[this is a full package so maybe we'll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m07s)

[make this one a Delta](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m09s)

[package um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m18s)

[release major](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m19s)

[version one okay do the rest of them for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m21s)

[me minor 2 three release label uh and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m24s)

[then we're going to change this to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m28s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m31s)

[DOT](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m33s)

[type then we don't want you to be a full](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m35s)

[we want you to be a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m37s)

[Delta right or we can even make you a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m39s)

[setup right doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m42s)

[we don't care about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m46s)

[this per se because this could be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m51s)

[anything setup. XE right that that'll](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m54s)

[work okay so this should build it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h38m59s)

[up](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m03s)

[and we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m07s)

[make releas group. size Plus](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m10s)

[or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m15s)

[equals release do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m18s)

[size because those should be in sync](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m21s)

[because this doesn't set](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m24s)

[anything this should probably actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m25s)

[default to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m27s)

[zero rather than having a default size](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m29s)

[of 1024 we don't know how it's going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m32s)

[get used and anybody using it should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m35s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m37s)

[be setting it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m38s)

[explicitly okay so this is needs to go](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m41s)

[down to release groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m43s)

[and then this probably needs to include](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m49s)

[releases as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m51s)

[well uh let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m54s)

[see bar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m57s)

[release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h39m59s)

[group](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m02s)

[um and then this should be release G](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m05s)

[well on let's copy this before we get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m09s)

[too carried away because we're going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m12s)

[need both um so this becomes release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m13s)

[groups](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m17s)

[should have](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m19s)

[single was it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m22s)

[the contain](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m24s)

[single okay and then this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m28s)

[becomes release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m31s)

[group should have two](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m36s)

[releases release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m39s)

[group this is ordering by major minor](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m42s)

[hatch but once you're in here it doesn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m48s)

[really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m52s)

[matter because you're inserting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m55s)

[into I think we're going to need another](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h40m58s)

[test uh because I think we need one for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m02s)

[creating the new](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m06s)

[group yeah I think we're going to need](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m12s)

[one for creating the new group as well](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m14s)

[cuz this ordering only makes sense in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m16s)

[the context](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m18s)

[of uh of when there's different versions](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m23s)

[but once we're inside the group they're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m25s)

[going to be the same version so that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m26s)

[doesn't really matter but what we would](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m28s)

[like to do is filter on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m31s)

[that and make sure that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m35s)

[exists because this is the one that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m39s)

[actually got spun](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m41s)

[up we want to do that and then on this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m43s)

[guy here for the release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m46s)

[group we want to do release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m50s)

[group major](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h41m59s)

[minor release group release label and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m02s)

[then we want to measure the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m05s)

[size this is 2048 is that what we expect](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m07s)

[because we've called create release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m11s)

[twice they both have and 24 so this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m13s)

[the expected total](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m17s)

[size and that's the key thing we wanted](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m19s)

[to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m22s)

[test okay](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m23s)

[build identifier expected what did I do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m39s)

[wrong oh I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m42s)

[dang it turns out typing's hard that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m45s)

[might be a signal that uh I'm getting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m48s)

[tired andan it is nearly 1](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m51s)

[a.m. Hang on we're going to try](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m54s)

[something crazy rather than Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m56s)

[we're going to try](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h42m58s)

[water it tastes good but it it tastes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m05s)

[Bland as well it's it's lacking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m08s)

[something like copious amounts of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m09s)

[sugar okay so uh send](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m13s)

[it let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m17s)

[how see how good my test coverage is at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m22s)

[the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m25s)

[moment we've already identified a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m26s)

[handful of tests that need to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m28s)

[written but let's make sure existing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m31s)

[stuff is still](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m34s)

[working we've got some stuff that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m35s)

[isn't broken at least one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m38s)

[thing and the API test we don't care](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m43s)

[about at the moment so this is one other](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m45s)

[thing this is both a blessing and a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m48s)

[curse I'll just show this off on one](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m50s)

[second let me let me move this out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m52s)

[of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m56s)

[this this doesn't matter this is the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h43m59s)

[front end project but whatever um so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m01s)

[we're going to invert this so this is a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m03s)

[um snapshot test that is going against](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m08s)

[my open a uh AP I spe yeah water](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m12s)

[unprepared coffee correct that is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m16s)

[exactly what I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m18s)

[mean um in an effort to make sure that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m20s)

[all Breaking API changes are explicit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m23s)

[and not accidental any change to the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m27s)

[open API spec requires uh an explicit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m31s)

[approval this test VA validates that the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m35s)

[open API spec for the API has not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m38s)

[changed it is the most obnoxious test I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m41s)

[have ever created](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m44s)

[it keeps me honest but it's like a there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m45s)

[are times I want to just disable it so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m50s)

[the key thing here that's pointing out](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m52s)

[on my response types Channel details is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m55s)

[now called release groups and now we've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h44m58s)

[got those release group thing that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m00s)

[that's a brand new Breaking API change](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m03s)

[I'm actually kind of shocked that that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m05s)

[the only thing but now that I think of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m07s)

[it it kind of makes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m08s)

[sense and I can see that my release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m10s)

[group one has a property ID and version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m13s)

[I'm also now acutely aware that I've](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m17s)

[broken my ability to get back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m19s)

[application releases because there's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m20s)

[nothing that's returning back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m22s)

[application release anymore where it was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m23s)

[previously coming back here so that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m26s)

[exciting so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m28s)

[we that test we don't care about that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m31s)

[this one here we just ignore it for the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m34s)

[moment because it's the last one we we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m35s)

[we do okay but we did break a number of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m37s)

[things that we should probably look at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m41s)

[uh we're going to start with the API](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m44s)

[ones I always start with the simpler](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m46s)

[test and work out to the more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m47s)

[complicated](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m49s)

[ones let's see delete](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m50s)

[project didn't work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m53s)

[properly what was the problem here so no](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m56s)

[reference exception that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h45m59s)

[exciting object reference not](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m02s)

[set](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m08s)

[okay what](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m11s)

[the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m19s)

[547 so one of these guys is not properly](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m21s)

[set oh we are not setting release which](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m29s)

[is going to be a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m32s)

[problem yeah so that will probably fix](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m34s)

[that so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m37s)

[it again because I suppress the null](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m38s)

[warning I then get a null reference here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m40s)

[see if that works](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m48s)

[better and if it doesn't we might just](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m51s)

[debug yay test went green okay that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m55s)

[just Kevin being an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h46m58s)

[idiot uh another no reference](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m00s)

[exception uh let's see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m04s)

[here yeah once again we have a project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m07s)

[here uh and I never assigned to it so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m09s)

[turns out that's probably not going to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m13s)

[work](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m14s)

[so that will probably be better](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m17s)

[now these are nice they aren't actual](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m20s)

[bugs as much as I can't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m22s)

[type or perhaps can't refactor either](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m26s)

[one okay test went green that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m32s)

[nice uh I didn't even read the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m36s)

[air number of releases expected to be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m38s)

[three but was two oh this is probably an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m41s)

[issue because of the switch that we did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m44s)

[and how things get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m47s)

[grouped um because this is using](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m49s)

[complete team](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m52s)

[yeah so number of releases should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m53s)

[actually be two but I'm thinking the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m56s)

[project](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h47m58s)

[details why is this not oh this is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m01s)

[Project details so it's only expected to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m04s)

[go down to the channels and the channel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m07s)

[has a number of releases yeah so that's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m10s)

[that's just a bad assertion](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m12s)

[because rather than getting one release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m15s)

[increase per vers or per asset you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m18s)

[getting one perversion which I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m22s)

[when people think about the number of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m25s)

[releases that they have that's the way](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m26s)

[that they're going to look at it is they](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m28s)

[don't care if there's a setup exe and a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m31s)

[Delta and a full package for one for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m34s)

[them that's just version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m36s)

[1.0 right and specifically 1.0 on a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m38s)

[channel because like I get if You' got](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m41s)

[like Windows and Mac those are separate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m43s)

[channels and so you've got a 1.0 on each](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m45s)

[of them and so counting those separately](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m47s)

[per Channel I think probably](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m49s)

[makes good sense okay so good news none](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m52s)

[of those things were real bugs those](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m55s)

[were just bad refactor of the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h48m57s)

[test okay so let's check this one here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m00s)

[what's the failure](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m03s)

[soed number of releases to be three but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m06s)

[was two so that's the first one so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m08s)

[that's probably an easy one because this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m11s)

[is ch Channel details so the same same](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m14s)

[refactoring that's fine that's what we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m16s)

[expected okay and then](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m19s)

[expected release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m22s)

[group be](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m25s)

[101 but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m27s)

[found this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m30s)

[one and you'll note the key thing here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m33s)

[the created ad is what's different right](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m36s)

[I can see the IDS are 69 e1b 69 e1b](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m39s)

[great](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m44s)

[version 101 version](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m45s)

[101 uh hour three I have a splash screen](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m48s)

[with a tiny image that's progress](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m51s)

[Pikachu don't don't sell yourself](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m54s)

[short I will say some of the splash](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h49m57s)

[screens especially with images do get](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m00s)

[fairly complicated if you have to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m02s)

[support like a large number of devices](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m03s)

[iOS tends to be easier because the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m06s)

[number of devices they have is much more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m08s)

[limited whereas Android the number of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m10s)

[devices that are out there is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m12s)

[huge and so getting something that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m15s)

[scales properly on all of them metric](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m17s)

[pain okay so our created at here is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m22s)

[what's biting us so let's see here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m24s)

[um so that's these guys](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m29s)

[here so I think all we have to do here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m34s)

[is change the created at to be release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m37s)

[group created at then we're done there](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m40s)

[then probably end up doing the same item](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m45s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m51s)

[see this is asserting on a it was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h50m58s)

[asserting on a count of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m01s)

[three I'm only building to Android but](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m10s)

[my first win of the day was just getting](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m13s)

[the Android emulator working in the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m15s)

[first place yes yes absolutely I will](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m16s)

[say it this may come as a shock it's](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m20s)

[actually better than it used to be um in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m23s)

[ye olden days of zamon uh we would](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m27s)

[always run third-party Android emulators](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m30s)

[because the built-in ones were such a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m33s)

[performance](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m36s)

[nightmare that they were almost](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m37s)

[completely](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m40s)

[unusable so the newer ones are actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m41s)

[better I won't say they're great](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m45s)

[but hyperview](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m49s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m52s)

[yeah it it is a it is somewhat difficult](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m53s)

[to get it all](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h51m58s)

[working and you do end up kind of having](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m00s)

[to do like multiple machine reboots and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m02s)

[swap stuff around like it is it is an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m05s)

[adventure just to get it set up the fact](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m08s)

[that you got it working though like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m11s)

[don't sell your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m14s)

[accomplishment okay so we so I'm curious](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m19s)

[here](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m22s)

[so so we expect two release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m24s)

[groups we expect the versions to match](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m32s)

[the create at we don't expect more than](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m35s)

[two okay so I think the third one was an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m37s)

[artifact of the fact that we previously](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m40s)

[had three](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m42s)

[I'm realizing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m47s)

[that release](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m50s)

[group oh so these guys can now drop off](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m53s)

[um but release group of my model should](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m57s)

[probably actually](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h52m59s)

[have I'm wondering if it should have an](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m02s)

[asset](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m05s)

[count they might need](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m06s)

[it I once spent a couple hours matching](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m09s)

[the date time from the browser the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m12s)

[correct and necessary time stamps uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m15s)

[postr was](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m18s)

[expecting that does not sound like a fun](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m25s)

[hour super charge like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m27s)

[that that sounds like something that](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m31s)

[that I would uh not wish upon even my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m34s)

[interns okay so that handled that now we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m38s)

[just have one alien test here okay so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m41s)

[this actually isn't that bad like we did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m44s)

[we did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m46s)

[decent the type datetime Inn net is so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m47s)

[much fun oh yes oh yes well and and some](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m50s)

[of our projects have actually gone as](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m54s)

[far as to ban its use uh specifically](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h53m56s)

[ban its use in favor of datetime offset](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m00s)

[because date time is fraught with Peril](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m04s)

[whenever you get into dealing with time](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m08s)

[zones and similar related](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m11s)

[bits it just it it's a kind of a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m13s)

[nightmare so when possible we push](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m17s)

[everything to datetime offsets and only](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m20s)

[go down to date times when we're down to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m23s)

[the display local but for web API stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m25s)

[you usually just send the offset all the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m28s)

[way down and then let the client do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m30s)

[it then it's not my](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m34s)

[problem but I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m38s)

[yeah depending on your database stuff](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m41s)

[like that gets that that gets kind of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m43s)

[hairy and it also gets even more hairy](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m45s)

[when you start talking](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m47s)

[about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m49s)

[like uh Pikachu you're doing SQL light](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m51s)

[on a mobile app well SQL light uh with](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m55s)

[ef core doesn't support datetime offset](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h54m58s)

[natively because it what is let me see](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m01s)

[if I can get this right take this with a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m04s)

[grain of salt because I'm doing this for](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m05s)

[memory but SQL light doesn't support](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m06s)

[datetime offset natively because their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m10s)

[Precision only goes down down to three](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m13s)

[it only goes down to milliseconds I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m16s)

[think and so but datetime offset can do](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m17s)

[ticks which are fractions of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m22s)

[milliseconds and so](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m24s)

[or again](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m26s)

[ish uh and because they can't accurate](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m28s)

[they can't uh represent it accurately it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m31s)

[gets it gets more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m34s)

[interesting oh wow](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m40s)

[yeah higher resolution but lower range](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m49s)

[that sounds about](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m53s)

[right it's interesting though I'm](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h55m59s)

[surprised you need more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m02s)

[range they only go down to micros](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m12s)

[seconds and net uses date times and this](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m18s)

[is one of those cases where I think I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m22s)

[think the mismatch causes people more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m25s)

[headaches than do the differences in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m27s)

[these](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m29s)

[ranges](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m32s)

[like how many how many people are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m34s)

[counting 10 what 10 million](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m37s)

[days when is Tick important uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m40s)

[um it really only matters when you when](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m45s)

[you need that level of accuracy and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m49s)

[precision like micros seconds are](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m52s)

[oftentimes good enough but if you're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m56s)

[doing like imagine you were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h56m58s)

[um for example if you were going to save](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m02s)

[off the duration of how long a unit test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m05s)

[took because test like this thing is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m08s)

[clearly only displaying you know tenth](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m11s)

[of a second](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m13s)

[so a millisecond would be fine but uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m15s)

[for like performance benchmarks the uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m18s)

[going faster than that or being more](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m22s)

[accurate than that is actually important](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m24s)

[because if you're testing like how fast](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m26s)

[an algorithm is being able to go f](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m28s)

[faster than a millisecond actually does](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m32s)

[count um I worked on an industrial](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m34s)

[printer at one point where we were](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m36s)

[trying to uh take pictures and we had to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m38s)

[go down to uh I think](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m41s)

[was it 10](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m45s)

[microsc no 10 nanc level accuracy um](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m46s)

[because we were dealing with a uh a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m52s)

[realtime chip and we had to send data to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m55s)

[it at that at that Precision because we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h57m58s)

[were printing uh](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m01s)

[pcbs and things were going really fast](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m03s)

[and when you have lasers and printing](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m06s)

[really](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m09s)

[fast uh small little bits in time matter](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m10s)

[for the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m15s)

[people that level of precision is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m17s)

[irrelevant um but for some applications](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m20s)

[it matters for a lot of cases it doesn't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m24s)

[like in a lot um I'm working on a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m27s)

[project now where we've got Ms SQL on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m30s)

[the back end and SQL light on the front](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m33s)

[end and we have to sync time stamps back](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m35s)

[and forth and we just throw](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m39s)

[away things that are that are blow](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m41s)

[uh a millisecond because we just don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m44s)

[care like in our case we care about the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m46s)

[minute we don't like the seconds don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m49s)

[even matter so it's like eh we're](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m52s)

[getting down to fractions of a second](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m54s)

[whatever it like it it's not relevant](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m57s)

[for what we're doing so context](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h58m59s)

[matters uh I remember in University at](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m03s)

[some point you build your project on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m06s)

[Hardware](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m09s)

[level like C++ yeah yeah and that I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m10s)

[think that for a lot of computer science](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m14s)

[students that's where they get their](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m16s)

[experience like for me the university I](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m19s)

[was at they did it in myips and it was a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m21s)

[lot of kind of teaching you how the](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m24s)

[low-level Hardware](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m26s)

[Works um it was kind of a brief](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m28s)

[introduction to people who might want to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m31s)

[dive into like firmware or](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m33s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m35s)

[um yeah it's I I think a lot of](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m37s)

[universities teach it because they want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m40s)

[software developers to kind of feel a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m42s)

[little more well-rounded they don't want](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m44s)

[them to just live in the higher level](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m46s)

[languages and not understand how your](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m48s)

[higher level C actually executes down on](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m51s)

[the CPU like they they want to give it](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m55s)

[at least some amount of visibility and](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=03h59m57s)

[do how do I get down to the lowlevel](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m00s)

[ones and zeros that are that are bit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m02s)

[learned from YouTube](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m13s)

[videos and frankly there's quite a bit](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m14s)

[of the industry you where you can learn](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m17s)

[better that way than um anything else](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m20s)

[like people make really good YouTube](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m25s)

[content and there is quite a](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m28s)

[bit anything smaller is](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m30s)

[imaginary that makes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m35s)

[sense um I've already forgotten what why](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m37s)

[this test failed uh okay so expected](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m40s)

[release group size to be 2048 but found](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m43s)

[1024 that's not that's the exact case we](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m49s)

[wanted to make sure did](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m52s)

[work let's see then I went to my first](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m55s)

[workplace and my supervisor was Adam](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h00m57s)

[about he hates lowl code no generic](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m00s)

[hates](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m03s)

[test](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m06s)

[yeah yeah there there are people in](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m08s)

[Industry that really don't don't like](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m12s)

[tests um and usually the argument goes](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m14s)

[something along the lines of don't](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m16s)

[bother spending time writing tests](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m19s)

[because it does take time to write tests](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m21s)

[like it absolutely does take time to](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m24s)

[write tests and it takes more time than](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m26s)

[not writing tests shocking um however](https://youtu.be/s-3LYuJVtUY?t=04h01m28s)
