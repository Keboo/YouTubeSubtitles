[hello everyone welcome back uh sorry](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m03s)

[about my tardiness this has been a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m06s)

[absolutely chaotic day uh this Sunday](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m08s)

[was Daylight Savings time and I don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m10s)

[think I have fully recovered it's been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m12s)

[several days a friend of mine posted on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m14s)

[line a joke that people with kids at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m17s)

[daylight savings time they don't just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m20s)

[lose an hour they lose an hour for every](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m21s)

[day for five to fourteen days afterwards](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m24s)

[which I think is pretty much spot on the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m26s)

[mark so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m28s)

[it's been it's been crazy it's been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m30s)

[absolutely crazy and then on top all of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m32s)

[that there's been car break issues and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m34s)

[then my wife has a pulled tendon in her](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m36s)

[thumb and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m39s)

[everything's been hard this week so uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m41s)

[tonight uh I'm actually going to start](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m44s)

[uh with the brain teaser rather than it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m46s)

[being at the end](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m49s)

[mixing things up gonna play around see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m51s)

[how it goes okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m53s)

[so uh for the brain teaser let's jump](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m55s)

[over here this one unfortunately comes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h00m58s)

[courtesy right of one of my repositories](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m02s)

[So for anybody who wants to play along](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m05s)

[at home](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m07s)

[here's the issue](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m09s)

[I have a GitHub action with this job](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m10s)

[here and it has a build job and the job](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m14s)

[does a few things it checks out the repo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m18s)

[setsup.net version 7X](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m20s)

[does a net build does a net test does a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m24s)

[net publish and uploads the artifacts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m27s)

[and this bug has been sitting here for a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m30s)

[while because unfortunately I never](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m32s)

[caught that it wasn't working properly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m35s)

[so if we look at the latest run on the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m37s)

[pipeline we can see it did in fact do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m39s)

[all of those steps it ran a.net build it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m42s)

[ran a.net test and then it did do a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m44s)

[publish and we can see all of that going](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m47s)

[and it uploaded artifacts and we can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m49s)

[actually go and look at the artifacts on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m51s)

[here and the site actually publishes out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m52s)

[and goes live on Azure and everything's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m54s)

[fine what is not fine is there are no](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h01m57s)

[tests being executed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m00s)

[you'll note here anybody who has done uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m02s)

[much test running with.net test usually](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m05s)

[there's output here you see you know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m07s)

[some number of tests passed some number](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m10s)

[of tests failed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m11s)

[there's none of that there's no tests](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m13s)

[so the question is why is there no tests](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m16s)

[because this sort of setup I think I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m20s)

[done many times and it's it's a subtle](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m22s)

[bug it's one of those I I came across](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m25s)

[this at the hackathon I did a couple](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m28s)

[weeks ago because I re-implemented this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m29s)

[same bug](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m32s)

[oh mini 4G thanks for the sub](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m35s)

[I I implemented this at the hackathon](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m37s)

[that I was at and my team and I were](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m39s)

[going along and a few hours in I went](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m42s)

[hey how how do you because one of our](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m44s)

[guys is really good at writing tests and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m47s)

[we accidentally published out a version](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m49s)

[of the software that had a bug that the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m51s)

[tests should have caught like the tests](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m54s)

[were straight up failing and I'm like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m55s)

[wait wait wait wait how did this get how](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m57s)

[did this get past the pipeline right my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h02m59s)

[workflow action should have should have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m02s)

[caught this there shouldn't have been a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m04s)

[bug yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m05s)

[you know where this is going no spoilers](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m08s)

[he was there he got to watch the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m10s)

[Revelation and I and I popped open this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m13s)

[GitHub action and I I was looking at it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m16s)

[in here I'll put these side by side if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m18s)

[make sure my big head isn't blocking](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m21s)

[anything uh and I stared at this for a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m23s)

[minute went hang on hang on what's going](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m25s)

[on so the the the first hint that I'll](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m28s)

[give is actually buried underneath the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m32s)

[publish](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m35s)

[um and maybe I'll make this guy a little](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m37s)

[bigger so here's the hint when the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m38s)

[dot-net so the dot net build is run](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m41s)

[the.net test is run and there's arguably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m44s)

[a bit of a bug here in the.net publish](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m47s)

[is oftentimes when you're doing a net](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m50s)

[publish you'll tack on this dash dash no](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m52s)

[build because you want to publish out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m55s)

[the same version of the artifacts that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m57s)

[you've just tested against right makes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h03m59s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m02s)

[the problem being and you'll note here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m03s)

[this thing says it's doing a restore](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m06s)

[and then it goes through and and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m09s)

[publishes all the stuff out and you know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m11s)

[there's some assembly optimization and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m14s)

[that was my first hint and I'm like hang](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m16s)

[on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m17s)

[hang on why is it doing a restore](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m18s)

[the the nougat packages should have been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m21s)

[restored when the build happened](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m23s)

[and so I came up to the build log and I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m25s)

[went huh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m27s)

[why do I not see some of this same like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m28s)

[Ms build type output in my build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m31s)

[and the reason there's no tests is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m34s)

[because the build didn't run](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m37s)

[but I I was like but there's a build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m40s)

[command here and I I see this it build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m41s)

[configuration release dash dash version](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m43s)

[1.0.182](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m47s)

[and after staring at this for longer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m49s)

[than I'll admit I realized ah crap ah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m51s)

[crap so the let me uh let me close this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m55s)

[down because I think that's actually on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h04m59s)

[a different thing so let me bring this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m00s)

[up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m02s)

[so you'll know I'm not even not even a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m03s)

[repository here if I do.net build dash](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m04s)

[dash version](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m08s)

[you'll know that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m13s)

[version Foo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m17s)

[dash dash version when you tack it onto](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m20s)

[dot net is actually a option that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m23s)

[designed to give you the version of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m26s)

[the.net](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m28s)

[or the yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m30s)

[version gets piped through and you end](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m33s)

[up getting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m35s)

[a version number](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m37s)

[real similar so it's not actually doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m40s)

[the build because I'm using dash dash](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m42s)

[version on the end of it and that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m45s)

[short-circuiting the build and causing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m46s)

[it to actually not compile builds really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m48s)

[fast zero seconds like show me another](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m52s)

[project that builds in zero seconds](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m56s)

[that's hard to do uh especially on uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h05m57s)

[free tier level build agents](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m01s)

[uh and then a test only took one second](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m03s)

[and the these times are probably just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m06s)

[due to rounding errors because I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m08s)

[guessing they were very fast](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m10s)

[um but once again same problem is we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m13s)

[don't have this so then the follow-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m15s)

[question is well how do we fix it right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m17s)

[like that it's it's great that there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m20s)

[the bug but but how do we go through and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m21s)

[actually fix this so conveniently there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m24s)

[is a and I'm going to save on doing this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m27s)

[right now so that this this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m29s)

[unfortunately this is just straight up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m31s)

[in one of my repos right now I did have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m33s)

[to go looking uh this just points to the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m35s)

[speeds of dot net seven yes yes.net7 is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m38s)

[able to print the version so quickly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m41s)

[um if we go to the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m44s)

[what do we call](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m47s)

[I'm blanking on the name Benjamin what's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m50s)

[the name of our project for the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m52s)

[hackathon](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m54s)

[I can go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m56s)

[Gilder there it is ha found it so you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h06m58s)

[just needed to think for a second so if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m00s)

[we go in here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m02s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m06s)

[if we go in here here is the appropriate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m09s)

[fix](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m12s)

[so rather than actually go or I should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m14s)

[say this is one of the fixes right so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m16s)

[there there are several options that you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m19s)

[can pass into your project there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m21s)

[things like version version suffix Etc](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m23s)

[um that have slightly different Behavior](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m26s)

[depending on what you want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m27s)

[um but the idea here is rather than](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m30s)

[using dash dash version which you would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m33s)

[what you really want to use is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m35s)

[I don't have my uh I don't have my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m38s)

[pretty little drawing what you really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m41s)

[want to use is this Dash p so Dash p](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m42s)

[what this ends up doing is sending a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m46s)

[parameter all the way through to Ms](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m48s)

[build so this is the equivalent of or a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m50s)

[rough roughly the equivalent of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m54s)

[specifying the version attribute inside](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m56s)

[of your CS project](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m58s)

[so this will actually pass it through](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h07m59s)

[because the whole point of setting this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h08m01s)

[version was because I wanted to version](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h08m02s)

[the software that was it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h08m04s)

[right so this gets passed through to the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h08m07s)

[build that way an appropriate version](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h08m09s)

[gets set and then you can do your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h08m10s)

[now on to the other stuff okay so there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m42s)

[are a few open pull requests I wanted to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m44s)

[get reviewed and merged and then I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m47s)

[got an issue to look at and then I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m50s)

[wanted to go back to doing the 5-0 stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m52s)

[I think I think that's where we're I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m54s)

[think that's where we're going](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h10m59s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m01s)

[oh Benjamin I don't know if you noticed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m02s)

[you got promoted to moderator](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m04s)

[I didn't ask I just did it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m08s)

[so there was that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m10s)

[um okay so let's do the unregister hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m12s)

[ones first so this one came in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m17s)

[this guy here Chris had opened an issue](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m18s)

[um pointing out a a memory leak in here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m22s)

[and then opening a PR for which is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m25s)

[awesome I love this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m29s)

[sorry](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m31s)

[there's a car alarm going off for a car](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m35s)

[that I don't recognize that's exciting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m37s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m40s)

[so potential memory leak and I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m43s)

[briefly looked at this before but I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m46s)

[actually want to check it out and take a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m48s)

[closer look because memory leaks like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m50s)

[this are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m52s)

[nefarious](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m54s)

[and I want to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m56s)

[a little more detailed on it so let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h11m58s)

[see awaiting my review this one uh uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m00s)

[add remote and checkout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m04s)

[that is one of my favorite get cracking](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m07s)

[buttons by the way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m10s)

[right click on PR and just Auto give me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m13s)

[the auto give you this thing okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m15s)

[Okay so we've got this okay so key](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m21s)

[things here scroll viewer assist and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m23s)

[this is one of those things where you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m25s)

[can't really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m27s)

[it's hard to unit test a a memory link](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m29s)

[like you could do like a benchmark.net](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m33s)

[test to make sure things are cleaned up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m35s)

[but this gets a little more difficult](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m38s)

[when you start talking about Frameworks](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m39s)

[like WPF at Play](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m42s)

[because outside of standing up something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m44s)

[with like xaml test it gets very](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m46s)

[difficult](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m48s)

[side note uh on the note of xaml test](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m49s)

[the keyboard stuff that I was fighting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m51s)

[last week](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m53s)

[struggle to find it struggled to find it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m54s)

[couldn't find it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m57s)

[then the problem miraculously](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h12m58s)

[disappeared](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m00s)

[yeah that doesn't leave me with a lot of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m03s)

[warm fuzzies](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m05s)

[um I hate bugs that miraculously just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m07s)

[disappear without uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m10s)

[any sort of feedback or knowledge of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m12s)

[them so I'm not actually confident that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m14s)

[the bug is gone just that it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m17s)

[disappeared](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m21s)

[it may rear its head again](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m22s)

[we'll see what happens](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m26s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m28s)

[so let's let's take a little look here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m31s)

[so there's a couple there's a couple](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m34s)

[cool things that were added in here so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m36s)

[all of this is around](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m41s)

[this uh scroll viewer support horizontal](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m45s)

[scroll because that is the let me just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m48s)

[close some stuff I got too much crap](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m52s)

[open](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m55s)

[this horizontal scroll source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h13m57s)

[then I want to look at this a little](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m00s)

[closely support horizontal scroll](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m01s)

[because the idea is that it's able to uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m05s)

[register up for the events so and and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m08s)

[this is probably easier so the code](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m11s)

[previously uh waited for the scroll](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m13s)

[viewer to be loaded that's what this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m15s)

[unloaded callback was doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m17s)

[um and then checks to see if we should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m21s)

[support horizontal scroll and then if so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m24s)

[registers the hook right otherwise](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m26s)

[removes the hook this probably should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m28s)

[have been called unregister hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m30s)

[but whatever uh not a big deal and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m32s)

[does does the needful](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m36s)

[um the issue is when you when you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m39s)

[register for events and I think I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m41s)

[talked about this before plus equals is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m43s)

[kind of scary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m47s)

[it's it's really really easy to leak](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m49s)

[memory because it's not really clear](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m51s)

[what's happening so when you have a plus](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m54s)

[equals like this in C sharp what this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m56s)

[ends up doing is creating a new delicate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h14m58s)

[so loaded is an event uh an event since](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m01s)

[she's sharp are you can think of almost](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m05s)

[like a list of delegates](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m07s)

[and when this delegate is created calls](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m09s)

[new there's two things that a delegate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m13s)

[is made up of a method info and a source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m15s)

[instance where the method info exists](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m18s)

[right and if in the case of a static](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m21s)

[method that Source instance will be null](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m24s)

[the leak typically occurs with uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m26s)

[instance methods where people don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m30s)

[realize that it's implicitly capturing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m31s)

[the this value right so this guy is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m34s)

[how do I say this without using the word](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m38s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m40s)

[it's one of those really bad words](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m41s)

[um when this is being created](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m44s)

[when the delegate is being created it is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m46s)

[capturing both the method info for this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m49s)

[on loaded](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m52s)

[as well as the instance on which this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m54s)

[exists](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h15m57s)

[as well as the instance on which it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m00s)

[exists wow that's a tongue twister okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m02s)

[so the key fixes in here are is with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m05s)

[this weak event manager which this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m09s)

[one of those classes that I always](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m12s)

[forget exists in WPF until I need it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m14s)

[it's amazing and wonderful so doing weak](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m16s)

[reference events is kind of a pain in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m19s)

[the neck it's difficult it's hard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m25s)

[but conveniently there's nice built-in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m26s)

[support for it where you can do this ad](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m29s)

[Handler and the key difference here is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m32s)

[this thing doesn't hold a strong](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m35s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m38s)

[to the the object under which you would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m39s)

[raise meaning if if it would if the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m41s)

[event would be the only thing holding it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m45s)

[alive](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m46s)

[well then it gets uh garbage collected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m47s)

[and goes away](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m50s)

[which is awesome which is also why you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m52s)

[end up with this kind of weird setup](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m54s)

[here where you end up having to pass](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m57s)

[this kind of thing which is which is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h16m59s)

[great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m04s)

[but I wanna I wanna look a little closer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m05s)

[at this so this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m07s)

[we come in here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m10s)

[uh if D is a scroll viewer meaning the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m12s)

[attached property has to be assigned to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m15s)

[a scroll viewer similar](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m17s)

[which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m18s)

[should happen](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m20s)

[comes in here if it is loaded do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m21s)

[unloaded otherwise](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m25s)

[ads handlers for both the loaded and the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m28s)

[unloaded](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m31s)

[I'm a little surprised](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m33s)

[we need both but let's continue on and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m36s)

[see what happens](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m38s)

[unloaded](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m39s)

[gets invoked and all unloaded does](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m44s)

[because it has to have this signature](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m46s)

[for this to work](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m49s)

[because the and specifically it has to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m52s)

[have this signature because that's the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m55s)

[signature for the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h17m57s)

[um the loaded event so if we just go and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m00s)

[look at this real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m02s)

[so here's an event routed event handler](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m03s)

[its signature is object routed event](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m06s)

[args which is why this guy must be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m08s)

[object routed event args perfect](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m10s)

[okay so this guy here just captures the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m14s)

[sender make sure it's a scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m17s)

[calls do unloaded this is where the real](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m19s)

[stuff happens](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m21s)

[okay so in both in all of these cases](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m22s)

[whether we come in from here or from](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m24s)

[here we call do unloaded](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m26s)

[um we check if get supported horizontal](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m29s)

[scroll is true if so we registered the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m32s)

[hook otherwise we unload the hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m35s)

[on unloaded we remove the hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m37s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m42s)

[so this guy here remove hook takes the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m45s)

[scroll viewer calls get value](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m48s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h18m54s)

[interesting so this does a it gets the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m01s)

[um the hook property which is what maybe](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m05s)

[we should look at register hook before](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m08s)

[we look at remove hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m10s)

[register hook okay so cleans up so this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m11s)

[is a common pattern with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m14s)

[um inventing is a minus equals](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m16s)

[um does nothing if it wasn't previously](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m20s)

[registered so it's very common when you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m22s)

[see people unregistering before](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m25s)

[registering from an event really what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m27s)

[they're doing is just making sure that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m29s)

[they don't accidentally double register](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m30s)

[because they can always blindly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m32s)

[unregister themselves before registering](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m34s)

[knowing that it'll either know up or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m36s)

[remove the previous registration those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m38s)

[are the only two outcomes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m40s)

[okay so it comes in here removes it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m43s)

[removes it gets the presentation source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m45s)

[verifies that it's a handle source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m50s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m55s)

[hook hang on I'm oh I got you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h19m57s)

[got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m01s)

[oh wow that's interesting Okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m10s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m14s)

[is a delegate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m17s)

[and it is a delegate with a very funky](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m20s)

[signature](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m22s)

[handle Source hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m25s)

[great I think this is similar to what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m26s)

[was there we'll go and look at the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m29s)

[changes in a minute I didn't do the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m30s)

[original changes so this is also a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m31s)

[learning opportunity for me so it takes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m33s)

[the the local function](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m35s)

[cast it into a delegate because the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m38s)

[signatures match great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m40s)

[sets the value for the source to be the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m43s)

[handle Source sets the hook to be the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m46s)

[value of hook and then call Source add](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m48s)

[hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m51s)

[and I'm guessing the only reason it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m51s)

[caching both of these is so that it can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m53s)

[do the remove later](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m56s)

[that is my working Theory](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h20m58s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m02s)

[and then this guy just does on Mouse](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m06s)

[tilt](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m09s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m14s)

[and that all makes sense to me now let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m15s)

[look at remove hook okay so remove hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m17s)

[pulls these guys out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m19s)

[yeah and so the whole point of caching](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m23s)

[the source is so that they can do Source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m25s)

[remove hook later and then nose out the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m27s)

[original property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m31s)

[technically Source could probably be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m39s)

[nulled out as well at that point](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m41s)

[it's not really going to make a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m43s)

[difference either way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m45s)

[this is a little this values a local](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m47s)

[now this one's the actual handle source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m51s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m55s)

[let's look](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h21m56s)

[okay so that explains why we're weak](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m01s)

[reference registering up for both of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m04s)

[these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m06s)

[because there's not a check on the E dot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m07s)

[new value in here it's just blindly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m10s)

[registering for both and saying you know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m11s)

[what in either case we want to basically](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m13s)

[reevaluate our state](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m15s)

[because if those things aren't both set](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m20s)

[we won't do the remove hook](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m22s)

[okay so let's go back now and let's look](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m25s)

[at this one more time](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m27s)

[now that I understand the changes I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m31s)

[looking it's one of those the diff view](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m32s)

[is hard to see all this stuff with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m34s)

[um can I do let's look at this as](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m37s)

[Unified](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m40s)

[I go back and forth between which diff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m42s)

[view is better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m44s)

[depending on what I'm looking at yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m46s)

[because the previous one was doing an if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m47s)

[new value and doing the if else now it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m49s)

[just checking for loaded](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m52s)

[okay so we come in here that all makes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m54s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m57s)

[that was the extra capture which was I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h22m59s)

[sure contributing to the leak](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m02s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m12s)

[I say ship it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m14s)

[let it rip uh so that goes there squash](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m16s)

[merge squash merge](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m20s)

[uh we're gonna go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m22s)

[okay the fact that the AI is completing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m31s)

[stuff is just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m33s)

[thank you AI I so this magical button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m35s)

[showed up earlier today](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m39s)

[and I can't decide if I hate it or if I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m41s)

[love it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m44s)

[it's basically a way into the being chat](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m45s)

[version of chat GPT that's basically](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m49s)

[what this is it's a it's a clever way to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m51s)

[get into chat GPT via Bing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h23m58s)

[which is cool but yeah again I'm torn on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m04s)

[whether I love it or hate it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m08s)

[okay so that goes out that goes out okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m10s)

[so let's take a look at this one and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m12s)

[then I want to go look at this one uh do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m15s)

[you have depend about Auto mergers](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m17s)

[triggering Builds on the main in this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m18s)

[repo yes well let me phrase](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m20s)

[I hope so otherwise something's been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m23s)

[Auto emerging on me and I don't know why](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m25s)

[I can confirm that real quick though da](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m28s)

[uh no I've got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m35s)

[yeah so there is the fastified GitHub](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m41s)

[action merge dependabot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m45s)

[set up on auto merge you'll note that I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m47s)

[have made this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m49s)

[the workflows in here potentially as](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m51s)

[complicated as I possibly could](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m53s)

[they're separate ones for PR](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m56s)

[verification I've done separate things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m57s)

[for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h24m59s)

[the the contributor bits I've got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m01s)

[version stuff I've got things shared the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m04s)

[inter really the interesting ones in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m08s)

[here are the release the icon update the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m10s)

[pr verification and the nightly release](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m13s)

[everything else is to support those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m15s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m19s)

[and this I think I could make even](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m21s)

[better but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m23s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m25s)

[it's one of those right now it's working](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m26s)

[and I have no reason to fix something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m29s)

[that's working](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m31s)

[okay so we're gonna check this out so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m32s)

[let's start with the issue let's start](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m34s)

[with the issue](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m36s)

[okay pop-up box adding shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m37s)

[uh uh except I want to add more Shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m41s)

[to emphasize the pop-up box and so this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m43s)

[is one of the things that WPF that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m47s)

[always that I go back and forth on so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m49s)

[for example my apps leverages uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m52s)

[attached properties a lot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m55s)

[um and this is one of those things where](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h25m58s)

[attached properties are awesome but it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m00s)

[not always obvious which control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m03s)

[templates they actually work in because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m05s)

[you can set an attached property on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m08s)

[anything doesn't mean it's going to do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m09s)

[Jack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m11s)

[um some people will put Behavior inside](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m12s)

[of the the property changed on their](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m15s)

[attached properties so that it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m17s)

[um then it doesn't matter if the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m20s)

[template it just applies it works which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m21s)

[is one option](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m26s)

[yeah I the there's also discoverability](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m27s)

[issue it's like yeah yeah I get confused](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m30s)

[uh what does it show on your commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m32s)

[history on Main if it triggers after](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m35s)

[Auto merge I don't think it's triggering](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m36s)

[not sure if you care though in this case](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m38s)

[just reminding me from the trigger the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m39s)

[issue the other day I was thinking about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m41s)

[that Benjamin uh I was thinking about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m43s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m45s)

[and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m46s)

[the thing is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m51s)

[from two days ago](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m53s)

[there's that guy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h26m56s)

[so and this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m03s)

[the the thing is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m04s)

[I have a nightly so I don't trigger on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m07s)

[Main on PR merges so which is probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m10s)

[the key difference](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m13s)

[um because oftentimes the the commits on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m15s)

[this repo tend to be very bursty like I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m17s)

[won't touch it for a couple days and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m21s)

[then I'll merge a bunch of PR's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m22s)

[and I didn't really want to kick off a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m24s)

[release every time I merged a PR](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m26s)

[so instead this nightly release kicks](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m30s)

[off](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m33s)

[and it is actually what's responsible](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m35s)

[for pushing things out so I kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m37s)

[cheat a little bit by having a a second](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m39s)

[action that triggers on a cron schedule](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m43s)

[and just runs](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m46s)

[so every so searching on Master is not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m48s)

[likely to give you a lot of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m52s)

[uh trust in it because for example this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m55s)

[guy here will trigger just fine but it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h27m59s)

[not actually going to do the whole](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m02s)

[yeah yeah it jumps around so for those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m04s)

[people who are interested what uh what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m07s)

[Benjamin's referring to is we did run](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m10s)

[into a fun issue around](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m15s)

[the dependabot auto merges](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m15s)

[um when it auto merges in pipelines that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m18s)

[are set to trigger on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m21s)

[um your main branch don't don't fire](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m24s)

[and it's kind of annoying so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m31s)

[useful if anyone has a strong fix for it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m34s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m42s)

[yeah so there's a there's a couple](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m46s)

[there's a couple things that are coming](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m47s)

[here so one I I suspect there's a way to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m49s)

[actually work around some of this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m52s)

[um I've got a few examples in my so the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m54s)

[the two issues called out oh no ungroup](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h28m57s)

[don't do that to me uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m01s)

[examples boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m04s)

[boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m07s)

[pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m10s)

[there is because there is a a couple fun](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m15s)

[ones that I've done in here where the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m18s)

[idea is to go through and change out the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m20s)

[the pop-up boxes template](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m23s)

[uh uh oh that is not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m28s)

[the file I was looking for is it here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m33s)

[oh man I may not know where it is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m36s)

[I might have to go undo for it the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m40s)

[there's ways to get around it but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m42s)

[they're kind of ugly so the short](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m44s)

[version is this one is designed to clean](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m46s)

[that up the other thing that kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m49s)

[excites me is last stream I talked about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m50s)

[uh the idea of kind of wanting to put](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m53s)

[together a page like this where there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m56s)

[a properties list on the right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h29m57s)

[and the control on the left so that you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m00s)

[can see everything that uh needs to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m02s)

[set on it and apparently Nikolai decided](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m05s)

[to go above and beyond and knock it out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m08s)

[of the park so Nikolai you are awesome](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m10s)

[just gonna say that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m15s)

[uh okay so when applying a drop shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m16s)

[to a card containing the pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m19s)

[there needs to be reserved space for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m20s)

[said drop shadow it cannot draw outside](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m22s)

[its bounds](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m25s)

[uh so adds a margin to bump the thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m28s)

[out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m32s)

[the other thing I would wonder is you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m33s)

[can sometimes sheet this Nikolai with um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m36s)

[clip to bound set to false so that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m39s)

[things don't end up clipping but that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m42s)

[can cause other things to be an issue in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m44s)

[this case I don't think margin bites you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m47s)

[because you're basically in control of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m49s)

[the whole window](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m51s)

[uh let's see papa box also supports](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m52s)

[custom offset](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h30m57s)

[let's see this made the calculations a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m01s)

[bit funky I don't believe they were](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m03s)

[correct in all cases I definitely did](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m05s)

[not support DPI scaling correctly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m07s)

[uh and didn't support flow Direction so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m10s)

[I can 100 believe that there are cases](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m12s)

[in this Library we where we don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m15s)

[properly handle flow Direction](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m17s)

[um and where we haven't taken DPI into](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m20s)

[account properly completely agree I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m22s)

[believe that like some of these controls](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m25s)

[have existed since before those were](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m27s)

[things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m28s)

[well not flow Direction but DPI](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m30s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m33s)

[so this refactors pop-up horizontal](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m35s)

[scroll vertical scroll](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m37s)

[pop-up box horizontal offset](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m40s)

[dedicated](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m43s)

[for manual testing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m44s)

[okay so here's what we're gonna do we're](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m47s)

[just going to check this PR out and go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m49s)

[pow-wow on this uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m51s)

[check out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m54s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m56s)

[okay so let's go fire this guy up and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h31m57s)

[let's just go play with it in the demo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m01s)

[first of all](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m02s)

[because this kind of looks pretty slick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m11s)

[come on recompile](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m18s)

[I will say I I also ran into an](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m22s)

[interesting issue today and I don't know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m24s)

[if it's related to my system but I I was](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m26s)

[running into problems with Snoop not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m28s)

[working after the update on Tuesday](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m30s)

[and I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m33s)

[I don't know if that's a me problem or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m36s)

[if it's a generic problem](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m38s)

[okay so we got a pop-up box so first of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m40s)

[all let's actually before we go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m43s)

[before we go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m44s)

[let's go play with the buttons area](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m46s)

[because I I'm guessing Nikolai didn't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m47s)

[touch these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m50s)

[yeah so we still have so this is this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m51s)

[one of the reasons people get really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m54s)

[confused about the pop-up box control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m55s)

[it's not fancy it is a toggle button and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h32m57s)

[a pop-up control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m00s)

[because the idea of I click button I see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m02s)

[pop-up is a thing people want to do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m04s)

[so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m09s)

[this kind of thing is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m15s)

[somewhat common and then being able to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m17s)

[have things where you can do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m19s)

[that kind of maneuver great okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m21s)

[so that all seems fine let's now let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m24s)

[go look at the new pop-up control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m26s)

[boom okay so love this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m28s)

[pop-up content and grid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m31s)

[it's a little dark and I kind of wish](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m34s)

[it probably doesn't support it because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m37s)

[we use so on the other controls we use](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m39s)

[show me the xaml so that you have that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m42s)

[little button you can click and see the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m44s)

[xaml](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m45s)

[I wonder if we could plug that in here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m47s)

[maybe not even as a pop-up but just like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m50s)

[have it xaml control next to it that'd](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m52s)

[be really slick but I would want it to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m54s)

[update as you change the properties](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m57s)

[which is currently not possible with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h33m59s)

[show me the xaml because it does all of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m02s)

[its xaml calculations at compile time](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m03s)

[not at runtime](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m06s)

[we'd have to do some some magic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m07s)

[magic okay so there's that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m10s)

[now if I change the elevation from 6 to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m15s)

[16 right that's big](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m18s)

[that's pretty good](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m22s)

[uh let's go 24](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m24s)

[and it the shadow is probably most](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m28s)

[obvious inside of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m31s)

[light mode](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m34s)

[then if we dial it down to like nothing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m36s)

[we get no Shadow on it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m40s)

[and little shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m45s)

[and then we've got the other style so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m48s)

[there's pop-up box which is the standard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m49s)

[and you can change out the content for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m52s)

[the toggle Button as well as what not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m54s)

[like this Floating Action one the only](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h34m57s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m00s)

[interesting pop-up content and grid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m02s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m09s)

[this one surprises me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m16s)

[I assume this thing must be aligning and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m25s)

[going off to the side like it's kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m27s)

[hard to tell without this grid showing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m29s)

[anything I almost want to put this in a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m31s)

[border just so I can see where it is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m32s)

[because elevation doesn't appear to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m35s)

[affect it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m37s)

[the other thing I'm noticing is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m38s)

[elevation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m44s)

[elevation is being applied to both the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m45s)

[toggle button and the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m47s)

[is that true here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m50s)

[um interesting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m53s)

[that seems like a bug](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h35m56s)

[the fact that with the material design](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m00s)

[pop-up box style elevation is a plot the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m02s)

[elevation elevation is a drop shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m05s)

[let's be clear](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m08s)

[here the elevation is being applied to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m10s)

[the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m14s)

[here it's being applied to the button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m17s)

[that's probably an artifact of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m24s)

[the content accepting the elevation drop](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m28s)

[shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m33s)

[do you remember that movie Rango](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m34s)

[I do not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m38s)

[I don't know if I've seen it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m40s)

[is it any good](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m42s)

[looks interesting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m52s)

[about a lizard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m55s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h36m58s)

[I'll add it to my list thank you thank](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m02s)

[you Decemberists truly and I appreciate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m04s)

[the follow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m06s)

[yeah so I think that that is something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m08s)

[Nikolai probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m12s)

[so that that that surprises me let's do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m15s)

[the the radius the other thing okay so I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m18s)

[kind of want to look at this demo page](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m21s)

[because this it's hard to evaluate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m22s)

[that style I like that we're exposing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m24s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m28s)

[this guy and then horizontal offset](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m30s)

[pop-up horizontal offset](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m39s)

[I didn't appear to do anything](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m42s)

[this seems as there's something off here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m55s)

[there's something off](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h37m58s)

[bottom and aligned edges oh this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m01s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m03s)

[I mean I don't doubt this moves](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m08s)

[but I kind of would anticipate a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m11s)

[horizontal offset oh that did move a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m13s)

[bunch](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m15s)

[hang on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m16s)

[oh okay hold on maybe it's working and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m19s)

[I'm just too stupid to realize it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m21s)

[got it top and a line left edges got it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m25s)

[top it okay so topping around align](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m28s)

[right edges would shift it to the edge](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m31s)

[there got it got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m34s)

[got it got it okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m37s)

[so it's so that that is actually working](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m40s)

[as designed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m42s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m46s)

[I'm just too stupid to be able to read](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m48s)

[and the horizontal radius is really hard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m51s)

[to see if you don't like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m53s)

[left on the line](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m57s)

[uh top edges](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h38m59s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m02s)

[so this is the one where it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m05s)

[yeah okay so that's fine that's fine](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m08s)

[like that like that pop-up content grid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m12s)

[color oh colored oh hang on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m14s)

[oh hello hang on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m17s)

[so my My Wish for being okay so turns](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m23s)

[out reading reading op](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m29s)

[and you should you should read all of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m33s)

[the combo boxes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m35s)

[so my my wish to have something that uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m39s)

[worked is right there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m43s)

[I still think there is an issue with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m48s)

[this elevation and this the difference](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m51s)

[in the behavior it seems very odd to me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m53s)

[that elevation would apply to the button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m56s)

[in one style and the content in the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h39m59s)

[other](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m01s)

[now with that said it we probably would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m03s)

[want both I can see people wanting to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m06s)

[set elevation for both the the pop-up as](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m09s)

[well as the button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m13s)

[now the button I think there's an easy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m17s)

[work around because you can just set the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m19s)

[content and set the elevation directly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m21s)

[there okay okay enough of this I think I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m23s)

[think we're good let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m27s)

[go pow-wow on the pr and actually see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m28s)

[what's here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m32s)

[okay so that's just adding the new page](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m35s)

[to the demo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m39s)

[for this to work](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m43s)

[uh therefore should not be needed here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m45s)

[so the quest this guy here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m46s)

[um let's look](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m53s)

[that's a good question about why is it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m55s)

[needed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h40m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m00s)

[oftentimes you won't get beyond the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m01s)

[defaults](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m04s)

[yeah so defaults is there this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m06s)

[actually one of the things in the FAQs](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m09s)

[that's a common problem and oftentimes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m11s)

[because people will complain that you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m15s)

[know a particular style isn't set](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m19s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m23s)

[box isn't actually included as part of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m33s)

[the defaults](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m37s)

[so that's so to answer the question](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m41s)

[Nikolai that's the issue of why](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m44s)

[why you had to add it because the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m47s)

[app.zaml just brings in the defaults](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m49s)

[dictionary the defaults dictionary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m52s)

[doesn't actually reference](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m53s)

[uh pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h41m55s)

[so in order to get any of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m04s)

[to explicitly reference any of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m07s)

[default Styles that's why uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m09s)

[uh because the app.xaml uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m14s)

[preferences the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m20s)

[defaults uh resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m27s)

[which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m28s)

[doesn't include the pop-ups](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m35s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m39s)

[I don't think there's any negative side](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m42s)

[effects for adding it uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m44s)

[let's see uh totally different question](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m52s)

[why does vs suggest to convert from](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m54s)

[regular regex to generator regex why](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m56s)

[does it push for a partial class and not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h42m58s)

[within the same class](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m02s)

[uh it's a good question good question uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m07s)

[let me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m11s)

[stand by uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m27s)

[a m or Q3](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m32s)

[are you not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m40s)

[sorry](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m42s)

[bye and I'll do it the hard way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m43s)

[should not be this hard to lower case](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m46s)

[today boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m48s)

[got that new uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m52s)

[uh I have to say this has been my new](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h43m58s)

[favorite way of spinning repos](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m00s)

[absolutely love the templates mwah I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m02s)

[been working on a couple more templates](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m05s)

[to add in as well and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m06s)

[I've been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m08s)

[I'm I've been really tempted I think I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m10s)

[going to add a second WPF template to my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m12s)

[to my templates repo one that adds a lot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m15s)

[more stuff in it because I keep finding](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m17s)

[this weird case between wanting a very](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m21s)

[simplistic repo with a minimal and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m24s)

[one that has like all the things right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m27s)

[like I want to do localization](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m30s)

[um trying to think there was a couple I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m34s)

[started writing them down there's a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m35s)

[handful of other things that I found or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m37s)

[I wanted an example of how to do a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m39s)

[tabbed layout like I'm thinking I might](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m41s)

[do a second one that's like WPF full or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m44s)

[something that has a lot more stuff that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m48s)

[way if you just want the basics you do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m51s)

[the basics you're good](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m55s)

[and then if you want the full one that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m56s)

[comes with a lot more opinionated stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h44m58s)

[that you might have to remove](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m00s)

[but you want to see better examples do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m01s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m04s)

[because that seemed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m04s)

[I I found myself wanting both cases](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m06s)

[because I've been using my this template](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m08s)

[a lot more and I've been slowly uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m10s)

[making notes and changing things on it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m12s)

[okay so the question was](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m13s)

[right so I've got something something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m16s)

[like a regex](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m19s)

[once Visual Studio wakes up and decides](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m22s)

[that it's not hung anymore](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m24s)

[come on Visual Studio you can do it it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m27s)

[not that hard to move a cursor](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m29s)

[I believe in you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m31s)

[please don't crash that would make me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m33s)

[feel oh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m35s)

[I'm not in new Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m37s)

[I'm not new Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m41s)

[okay you're gonna die](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m43s)

[Boom die go away](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m48s)

[uh open with new Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m51s)

[what's up Robert yes it is WPF because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m55s)

[it is awesome](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h45m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m02s)

[I know it isn't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m03s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m06s)

[no it is WPF it is WPF](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m09s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m13s)

[show me my solution we just I just all](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m16s)

[of this because I wanted to show a regex](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m18s)

[now did I need to spin a solution with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m20s)

[two projects in unit tests just to show](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m23s)

[a generator regex no](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m24s)

[but was it easy yes and that's what's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m26s)

[important uh okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m28s)

[my regex gets new](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m31s)

[oh hush now](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m34s)

[see this is the other thing I've been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m35s)

[wanting to add rejects Lane](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m37s)

[I think what you mean is totally awesome](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m39s)

[You misspelled totally awesome or be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m41s)

[awesome uh so we've got something that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m44s)

[you know bam find a decimal exactly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m47s)

[three repetitions something like that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m51s)

[right and we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m52s)

[we're gonna do that so that it doesn't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m55s)

[right and I believe here is where it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h46m57s)

[gives you the prompt convert to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m00s)

[generator regex so if you are targeting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m01s)

[newer stuff and you have access to the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m04s)

[source generated regex this is a nice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m07s)

[performance gate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m10s)

[now](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m12s)

[and maybe I'm biased](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m16s)

[Benjamin but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m18s)

[this did go within the same class but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m23s)

[I'm wondering if it's because it was](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m26s)

[already partial so let's let's try again](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m27s)

[uh public we'll make it as complicated](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m30s)

[as possible](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m33s)

[uh sealed class uh my poo because that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m35s)

[what we do here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m41s)

[we achieve Benjamin](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m44s)

[hang on I gotta change tenants](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m47s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m51s)

[uh oh you're gonna hand me sample code](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m54s)

[even better even better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h47m59s)

[uh oh I see so the question is why does](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m04s)

[it oh I see ah got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m06s)

[okay Robert you asked for it I'm using](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m11s)

[that regex I have no idea what it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m12s)

[matches uh let's see so Rejects](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m14s)

[uh no](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m18s)

[we're gonna call it Robert because darn](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m21s)

[it Robert gave me a regex](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m24s)

[uh wow uh hang on I uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m28s)

[there we go boom Okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m34s)

[I have no idea what this reject does so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m39s)

[got it uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m41s)

[Robert regex because that's and with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m43s)

[Robert regex with two e's and two x's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m46s)

[because I can't spell or type](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m48s)

[so the so the reason why it pushes for a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m51s)

[partial class is because that's how this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m54s)

[Source generator is ultimately going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m56s)

[work so this is leveraging](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h48m57s)

[um partial methods in C sharp so prior](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m01s)

[to Source generators partial methods](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m03s)

[were kind of of limited use](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m06s)

[um like some things still leverage them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m08s)

[like t4s tooling did because it was it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m11s)

[a it was a way for a method to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m16s)

[declared in one part of the class one of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m19s)

[its partials but be implemented](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m22s)

[elsewhere but the rules around it were](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m23s)

[pretty strict like that both the the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m26s)

[partial and its implementation both had](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m29s)

[to Exist by the time you hit the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m31s)

[compiler with Source generators they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m33s)

[relax some of those rules and said well](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m35s)

[don't need to know about them right away](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m38s)

[as long as they're there by the end](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m40s)

[that's good enough right give the source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m42s)

[generators a chance to provide the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m44s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m45s)

[which is what this thing is ultimately](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m47s)

[doing so if we look at this guy so one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m49s)

[my big head's in the way hang on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m54s)

[ah shoot we'll just F12 it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h49m57s)

[one I don't know about you Robert I have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m00s)

[no idea what your regex does but that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m02s)

[that's a very long explanation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m04s)

[and it doesn't actually look that bad](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m09s)

[it did the indentation it made pretty](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m12s)

[little bullet points for me in my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m14s)

[opinion this feature of Auto generating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m17s)

[the docks for your regex that alone is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m20s)

[worth converting your regex's for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m24s)

[that if it did nothing else](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m26s)

[that that is worth it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m33s)

[because it fixes one of the biggest](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m34s)

[issues with regex which is how the heck](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m36s)

[do I read this thing like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m39s)

[yeah ignore the fact that there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m42s)

[performance gains and all that other](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m44s)

[stuff that can happen yeah that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m45s)

[optional this is the good stuff this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m47s)

[where it's at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m50s)

[um but the reason it pushes for a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m52s)

[partial class is you'll note when I F12](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m55s)

[into it I'm now in the uh Source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h50m57s)

[generator partial version of the method](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m00s)

[where this thing is actually implemented](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m02s)

[it so in order for so the reason it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m04s)

[pushes for a partial class is because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m07s)

[the source generator needs a place to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m10s)

[actually implement this method because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m12s)

[what it's doing under the hood is it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m14s)

[actually it goes crazy so you'll Note](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m16s)

[One it does a partial of my class here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m18s)

[but then it also has this other type](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m21s)

[that it generates this regular](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m23s)

[Expressions generated Robert redjacks](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m25s)

[and you'll know it it starts doing this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m27s)

[magical in incantation thing but if we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m29s)

[look over here the the big benefit of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m31s)

[this is regex's in yield days like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m35s)

[pre-november](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m39s)

[um they would have to go through and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m41s)

[parse that string at runtime and convert](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m43s)

[it into the logic of the regex right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m46s)

[because it has to convert into what's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m48s)

[called a finite state automata right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m50s)

[basically a really fancy State machine](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m53s)

[that way I could figure out you know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m56s)

[does the text match all of that stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h51m58s)

[well with the the new regex stuff what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m00s)

[they do is they do that parsing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m03s)

[at compile time with the source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m06s)

[generator which is awesome right because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m08s)

[most of the time you're not building up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m10s)

[these regeck patterns dynamically like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m12s)

[that is one of the the rules with this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m14s)

[is your regex pattern has to be known at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m15s)

[compile time to do the evaluation at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m18s)

[compile time okay okay kind of makes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m20s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m23s)

[um but most of the time we know our](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m24s)

[regex things add compile time and if we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m26s)

[scroll down through this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m30s)

[somewhat ugly looking thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m33s)

[um we can find our implementations of uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m36s)

[the the state machine of where it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m41s)

[actually walking through using slice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m43s)

[right so this is going to be the span](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m46s)

[stuff in order to be able to find](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m48s)

[read only span of chart in order to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m50s)

[able to find these positions so it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m53s)

[doing that same state machine logic that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m55s)

[the the regex engine would have done at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h52m57s)

[runtime but now it's doing it at compile](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m00s)

[time which then allows the compiler to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m02s)

[go through and do whatever optimizations](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m05s)

[it's going to do to this and so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m07s)

[oftentimes this regex will be faster](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m09s)

[not a lot and with net](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m13s)

[either.net5 or net six they did some](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m17s)

[work to Cache repeated patterns so you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m20s)

[would only ever even take that hit once](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m24s)

[at startup but now you don't have to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m25s)

[take the hit at all](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m27s)

[but did so circling all the way back to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m29s)

[your question Benjamin the the whole](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m31s)

[reason why it pushes for partial is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m33s)

[because in order for this attribute to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m35s)

[work this attribute is just a marker for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m38s)

[a source generator and the source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m41s)

[generator has to put the code somewhere](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m43s)

[and so in order to make the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m45s)

[implementation of this method exist it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m47s)

[has to put it in a generated partial of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m50s)

[your myfu so your mifu will actually](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m52s)

[show up here and if you want to see it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m55s)

[rather than going through](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h53m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m01s)

[F12 what you can do is you can come up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m03s)

[to your dependencies analyzers and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m05s)

[the system text regular expression](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m08s)

[generator expand this out now I can do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m10s)

[this because this project is small if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m13s)

[you do this on like a production project](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m16s)

[of any size this list is insane just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m17s)

[fair warning so you'll note here I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m21s)

[expanded oh look there's my file you do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m23s)

[this on a solution that has a few](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m25s)

[thousand files where you've leveraged](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m27s)

[Source generators a ton](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m29s)

[yeah yeah it's a big](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m35s)

[it now it's obviously sorted and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m36s)

[alphabetized but it's a big](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m39s)

[um but you can also get into the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m42s)

[generated versions this way which is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m43s)

[what you get when you have 12 into it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m45s)

[so what it's worth](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m52s)

[yeah partial methods are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m53s)

[they they were very limited in their](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h54m57s)

[application prior to Source generators](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m00s)

[once Source generators hit the scene](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m03s)

[that's when things that's when things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m05s)

[got lit because then because the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m08s)

[compiler it goes to compile yeah the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m11s)

[compiler team relaxed some of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m14s)

[restrictions on partial methods to make](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m15s)

[Source generators powerful and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m18s)

[everybody started writing Source](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m20s)

[generators and it went](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m22s)

[uh uh and it went awesome uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m25s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m31s)

[back to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m34s)

[this okay so let's see here uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m37s)

[this was a bit of a surprise to me when](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m41s)

[Papa box style is set to floating it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m43s)

[seems like something strange is going on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m45s)

[with the content of the pop-up that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m47s)

[shows the style override is left out the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m48s)

[text block will have a white foreground](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m51s)

[and thus seemingly invisible in the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m53s)

[light theme of the demo app](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m56s)

[okay so let's go take a look at this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h55m59s)

[then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m06s)

[uh I think I need to see this in context](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m09s)

[this is popupbox.xaml](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m13s)

[oh this is the content template so this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m17s)

[is the grid with 100 text box 100.](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m23s)

[and this is explicitly so this is in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m25s)

[reference to this style here that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m28s)

[setting the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m30s)

[um text element foreground to change it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m32s)

[forward and back](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m35s)

[and I think this is potentially the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m38s)

[wrong brush even](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m40s)

[because I think it's usually is paper in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m42s)

[the background or the foreground that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m44s)

[one of the things we're going to fix](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m46s)

[let's go look at this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m49s)

[time okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m54s)

[this is up in the demo app under pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h56m58s)

[box so I kind of want to try](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m07s)

[so let's let's just do this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m11s)

[I have a feeling I I have a guess as to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m13s)

[what's going on already](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m16s)

[so the the other template for the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m18s)

[box where it does the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m22s)

[the the action button it's really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m24s)

[designed around](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m32s)

[let's go here uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m34s)

[00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:45,839](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m36s)

yeah uh I think it exists in three as

[well as two we'll double check](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m45s)

[uh buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m47s)

[Floating Action button so this is the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m51s)

[the that that style for the pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m54s)

[was largely built around this guy here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h57m57s)

[this Floating Action button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m01s)

[this was his intent of how he's expected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m05s)

[to be used and I can't remember if one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m09s)

[of these has a better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m11s)

[and this it's probably even more obvious](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m13s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m16s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m17s)

[we'll need action buttons yeah because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m23s)

[you'll know this is a even inside of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m25s)

[material design this is very very much](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m27s)

[Ace](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m30s)

[a special button oh crap sorry one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m31s)

[second](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m35s)

[just gotta](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m35s)

[build failure this this is this please](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m37s)

[don't be the UI test](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m44s)

[uh Proctor](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m48s)

[pass pass pass](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m51s)

[I'm worried this is going to be our](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m53s)

[password box tab control thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h58m56s)

[to the bottom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m00s)

[one failed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m03s)

[uh where's the failure failed pass](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m08s)

[passed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m11s)

[looking for big long stack Trace](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m17s)

[there's my stack trace it is a xaml test](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m20s)

[uh a password box test yeah this looks](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m25s)

[like the one that goes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m35s)

[uh yeah I might have to look at this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m40s)

[these yeah respects keyboard tab](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m42s)

[navigation dang it yeah the one that I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m45s)

[said the bug mysteriously disappeared](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m48s)

[found it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m51s)

[not thrilled about that anyway](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m54s)

[so this is the idea oh we don't actually](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=00h59m57s)

[support the extended one huh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m01s)

[that might be an interesting I I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m04s)

[we I think you kind of get this with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m06s)

[some of the other button Styles but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m08s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m09s)

[um this was the intent behind it of this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m10s)

[sort of interaction so it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m14s)

[and really the style should probably be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m17s)

[redeemed that might actually be a good](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m20s)

[idea for 5-0 is fix the thing so that it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m21s)

[actually call follows the floated action](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m24s)

[button name](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m28s)

[to be real like this guy here this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m29s)

[what he's intended for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m33s)

[uh uh okay so let's go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m37s)

[and let's intentionally go light theme](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m40s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m46s)

[let's change you to colored grid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m49s)

[yeah and so he's ending up with the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m53s)

[white](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m56s)

[for the foreground which is getting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h00m57s)

[set weird Okay so we're gonna I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m01s)

[try Snoop](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m03s)

[and see if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m04s)

[not see snoops working just fine I don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m08s)

[know what's going on I don't know what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m10s)

[was going on with my Snoop earlier okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m11s)

[so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m16s)

[let's go with here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m18s)

[foreground](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m21s)

[so we can see so here's a good lesson](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m24s)

[it's due](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m27s)

[so first of all I've set my focused item](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m28s)

[to the to the text box here right so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m32s)

[this is the I grab that guy and then we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m34s)

[can see this guy is inherited and so we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m38s)

[can start walking up the the food chain](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m40s)

[and you can see text element foreground](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m43s)

[is an attached property that gets](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m45s)

[inherited down you say Okay inherited](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m48s)

[keep walking up the food chain walked up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m50s)

[the food chain walk up the food chain](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m51s)

[uh walk up the food chain](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m54s)

[gonna keep collapsing as I go so left](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h01m59s)

[Arrow left Arrow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m01s)

[okay so you'll note here we've gotten](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m05s)

[all the way up to the pop-up box where](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m09s)

[the foreground is being intentionally](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m11s)

[changed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m13s)

[and if we go any deeper we can see that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m15s)

[this is then inherited so it's the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m18s)

[foreground on the pop-up box itself](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m20s)

[that's doing it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m22s)

[um that's getting this primary Hue uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m25s)

[foreground if we look I suspect the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m27s)

[uh pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m39s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m40s)

[uh uh I was looking](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m46s)

[multi-floating action pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m49s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m52s)

[I think that's near the bottom if I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m57s)

[remember right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h02m59s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m01s)

[so uh primary Hue mid foreground brush](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m03s)

[which primary humid foreground brush is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m11s)

[getting white for this thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m13s)

[which means it's expected to have the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m20s)

[higher contrast when shown against a the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m23s)

[uh the background](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m28s)

[of mid now this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m30s)

[so and and this is probably one of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m36s)

[weird cases is this the the problem with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m38s)

[the pop-up box control again is it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m42s)

[based around the idea of a toggle button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m45s)

[and a pop-up that's it toggle button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m46s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m49s)

[but when you set the foreground property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m50s)

[on a control where do you expect that to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m53s)

[be applied because we kind of have this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m55s)

[weird separation between the toggle](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h03m57s)

[button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m00s)

[and the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m01s)

[should the should the foreground color](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m03s)

[be based around the toggle button or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m05s)

[should be based around the pop-up in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m07s)

[this case this foreground is being](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m09s)

[intentionally set because the backdrop](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m10s)

[under which it expects to be applied is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m14s)

[the primary humid brush so it makes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m16s)

[perfect sense the background would be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m19s)

[the mid brush and the foreground would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m20s)

[be the foreground for the mid brush that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m22s)

[that tracks the problem is is this uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m25s)

[foreground is being forwarded to both](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m29s)

[the toggle Button as well as the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m32s)

[and in this demo case this without this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m34s)

[style this is ending up uh causing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m39s)

[problems](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m43s)

[I'm trying to decide what the right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m47s)

[solution here is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m48s)

[because part of me wants to say that it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m52s)

[would be better for us to not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m54s)

[not abuse this style the way that we are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h04m57s)

[because I think this guy so let's look](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m02s)

[at where does this this guy get applied](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m09s)

[so this sets here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m14s)

[this guy here is probably being](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m18s)

[referenced](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m22s)

[uh element name combo box selected item](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m23s)

[yeah so this guy's intentionally setting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m33s)

[the the content](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m35s)

[and I'm wondering if the issue is that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m38s)

[we really shouldn't be using](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m40s)

[this particular bit of content](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m42s)

[static comma the data template converter](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m50s)

[oh what does this converter do that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m53s)

[looks clever](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h05m55s)

[oh that is clever](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m00s)

[so it goes so this this is actually](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m05s)

[really slick so this this is using](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m07s)

[property pattern matching so this says](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m09s)

[uh if the value is a combo box item and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m12s)

[that combo box item has a tag property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m16s)

[that is a data template return the data](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m18s)

[template otherwise return null and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m21s)

[there's a null bang here and in reality](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m23s)

[what I prefer to do on these is change](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m25s)

[these things up so WPF does not have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m30s)

[nullable reference type annotations](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m33s)

[enabled on them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m35s)

[um which is really unfortunate it's also](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m38s)

[very unlikely to receive them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m40s)

[and so the question becomes uh what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m43s)

[should you do because on the interface](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m46s)

[none of these values uh so the nullable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m49s)

[reference types like for example this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m53s)

[parameter could be in one of three](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m55s)

[states it could be declared not nullable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m56s)

[it could be declared nullable or it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h06m58s)

[could be in an unknown State I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m00s)

[there's a different word for it but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m02s)

[those are the three states that you can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m03s)

[kind of be in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m05s)

[um and then it gets a little more hazy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m09s)

[because how you declare and what the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m10s)

[compiler knows you to be may not line up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m13s)

[difference different tension](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m15s)

[the but for WPF these are effectively](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m17s)

[all in the unknown state](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m21s)

[so my small preference small preference](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m23s)

[is to at least declare on value](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m27s)

[converters the return type the value in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m30s)

[the parameters null is because these are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m32s)

[very easy to get nulls coming through on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m34s)

[I generally don't declare the type or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m37s)

[the culture info it's nullable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m40s)

[um because there's as far as I'm aware](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m42s)

[no known cases where WPF will pass a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m45s)

[null for these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m47s)

[now you obviously could instantiate one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m49s)

[of these converters and send a null](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m52s)

[through that's a thing you could do like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m54s)

[if you were unit testing one of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m56s)

[converters and not using it as part of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m57s)

[the xaml that's totally a thing but this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h07m59s)

[is usually the way I prefer to handle it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m02s)

[so rather than rather than the null Bang](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m04s)

[there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m07s)

[because if Nola is possible you should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m08s)

[probably declare it that's one of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m11s)

[things I've noticed is a lot of people](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m13s)

[get hung up on Noble reference types and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m14s)

[wanting to declare everything is not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m18s)

[nullable because they don't have to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m20s)

[check for null everywhere but the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m22s)

[reality is is if the thing can be null](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m24s)

[declare it nullable like it's it's not a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m26s)

[bad thing to declare something notable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m29s)

[yes it means you're going to have to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m31s)

[appropriately null check on wherever](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m32s)

[you're consuming it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m34s)

[so what you should have been if a null](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m36s)

[is possible coming through it you should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m40s)

[be no checking it anyway](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m42s)

[by declaring it appropriately you've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m44s)

[declared your intent and now the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m47s)

[compiler can help you versus telling the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m48s)

[compiler shut up I know better than you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m51s)

[sorry moment sorry I need to check this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m54s)

[I have a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h08m58s)

[friend's kid is in the hospital so we're](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m00s)

[getting status updates](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m02s)

[cool sounds like he's doing better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m07s)

[that is what we'd like to hear](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m11s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m12s)

[that converter is kind of clever like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m14s)

[the converter that's rather slick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m16s)

[um okay but I think for these it almost](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m20s)

[might be better for the the template to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m23s)

[not be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m27s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m30s)

[um and I think if we go back here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m34s)

[uh close you Snoop if we change this to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m37s)

[stack of buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m40s)

[this is more in line with what I would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m42s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m44s)

[and I and I'm a little torn because I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h09m57s)

[know the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m00s)

[um this behavior of the foreground has](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m02s)

[bitten people in the past](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m04s)

[and maybe it's worth considering on the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m08s)

[style](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m10s)

[for like ignoring the foreground](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m13s)

[property it's just it's one of those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m16s)

[hard things to do right like should you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m18s)

[ignore what the foreground is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m20s)

[like normally what I would what I would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m24s)

[be telling people to do here is through](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m26s)

[something like uh text element dot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m28s)

[foreground and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m31s)

[right and then Elevate this guy to here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m35s)

[though I would also probably say that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m38s)

[this should be a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m41s)

[Dynamic resource because this can change](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m44s)

[um at runtime it's it's less of a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m47s)

[problem here because the because this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m50s)

[isn't a data template this is uh going](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m52s)

[to be recreated and at least in the demo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m56s)

[app it's not really possible to change](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h10m59s)

[your theme mid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m00s)

[with the pop-up still open so it's it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m03s)

[not likely to show up as an issue but in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m06s)

[general brushes dynamic looking at you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m09s)

[teleric oh my word I had so many issues](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m12s)

[this week with weird things for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m15s)

[reference side tangent](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m18s)

[if in an instance Constructor you call a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m21s)

[static method that mutates static State](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m25s)

[knock it off](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m28s)

[that is completely unexpected don't do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m31s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m33s)

[Constructors should not mutate Statics](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m35s)

[or I should say should rarely ever](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m38s)

[mutate static State that's not a thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m40s)

[they should do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m43s)

[now](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m44s)

[maybe if the static state is like an](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m46s)

[instance counter or something sure maybe](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m48s)

[that's acceptable right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m50s)

[in your seaming and changing your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m52s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m54s)

[no](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m56s)

[ah okay soapbox removed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h11m58s)

[yeah I do wonder if the solution is for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m03s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m06s)

[when you go to the when you go to The](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m08s)

[Floating Action pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m11s)

[it almost might be nice to given this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m14s)

[style take away the option of this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m17s)

[content and just force it into the stack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m19s)

[of buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m22s)

[I do also like how it doesn't reposition](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m26s)

[during scroll that's fun I don't think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m29s)

[that's a new bug I think that's existed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m32s)

[for a while but it's a fun one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m34s)

[um okay so I'll do that I'll do that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m37s)

[also huge points I love I love it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m39s)

[anybody who's watching my stream for too](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m43s)

[long knows that fuchsia is clearly the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m45s)

[color of to do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m47s)

[um I joke with the one of the designers](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m49s)

[I work with in my day job that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m52s)

[I will use fuchsia because I know it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m54s)

[ugly enough that they will not let it go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m57s)

[to production without changing it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h12m59s)

[it's like give me a design or I make it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m01s)

[fuchsia](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m05s)

[that is the threat and it's only mildly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m06s)

[a threat because I will totally do it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m11s)

[so absolutely love the fuchsia clearly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m12s)

[the best choice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m15s)

[ship it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m17s)

[yeah but I do yeah I I kind of think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m19s)

[that the fundamental problem is this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m22s)

[template](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m25s)

[with a style where it's not intended to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m26s)

[be used](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m28s)

[that's that's my thought](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m31s)

[so is it expected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m33s)

[kinda](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m36s)

[and that's how you debug it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m37s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m39s)

[we need to go back to here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m42s)

[and here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m49s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m51s)

[uh uh with the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m53s)

[dude](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h13m57s)

[nope that is not what I wanted on my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m00s)

[clipboard let's try that again boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m06s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m08s)

[uh uh it is sort of a hard case](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m10s)

[uh because we apply the same foreground](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m15s)

[background to both the button and the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m22s)

[pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m27s)

[sorry Nikolai I realize this isn't a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m32s)

[long great explanation but I'm also](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m34s)

[aware that you're probably watching the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m36s)

[stream at some point so I'm cheating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m37s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m43s)

[I'm also gonna push my changes so that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m45s)

[you have them as well uh the margin](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m48s)

[applied to the stack panel is there to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m50s)

[ensure there is enough room for the drop](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m52s)

[Shadows the button in the stack panel](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m53s)

[oh interesting let's look at that stack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h14m59s)

[of buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m01s)

[okay so if I set this to 24](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m03s)

[is that actually applying the same](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m09s)

[those buttons are so tiny it's kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m12s)

[hard for me to tell](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m13s)

[the other check set it to zero](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m19s)

[I don't think the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m24s)

[uh that that has a drop shadow](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m31s)

[I don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m34s)

[think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m35s)

[and this is probably an artifact of when](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m37s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m40s)

[oh I bet you I bet you hold on hold on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m41s)

[if I go here stack of buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m44s)

[and I we should restart the app because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m52s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m55s)

[seems like it's gotten itself in a not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h15m58s)

[right state](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m01s)

[let's clean this up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m03s)

[just restart real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m07s)

[hot reload is is great right up until it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m10s)

[is not hot and not reloading](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m12s)

[okay Apple box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m17s)

[I I wouldn't be interested so like I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m20s)

[Gonna Leave This page is gonna make it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m24s)

[into the demo app and ship](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m26s)

[I'm curious what people think if they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m28s)

[prefer Pages like this where you can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m30s)

[play around with just a single control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m32s)

[and its relevant Properties or whether](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m34s)

[you prefer something more like this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m36s)

[where you get a uh rather than having to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m38s)

[change all the properties to see the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m41s)

[options you can kind of just see them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m43s)

[all laid out in front of you like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m44s)

[there's pros and cons to each](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m45s)

[and I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m49s)

[if it's worth maybe like I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m51s)

[if this pop-up page should be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m56s)

[uh if there should be a selector near](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h16m58s)

[the top that's like pick my control and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m00s)

[then pick my Styles and properties to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m03s)

[see it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m05s)

[uh too much pain if you're too hot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m06s)

[reload it's so nice when it works but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m07s)

[the key word is when](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m09s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m11s)

[yes when is correct](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m12s)

[uh this is something else that I would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m15s)

[love to put into like a more full uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m17s)

[WPF template when I put it in is having](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m21s)

[built-in stuff for for doing things like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m24s)

[um styling](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m27s)

[right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m29s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m32s)

[this is the other problem part right to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m33s)

[left left to right yeah how to how to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m35s)

[confuse people real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m38s)

[uh okay so I want to change you to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m40s)

[action pop-up I want to change you to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m42s)

[stack of buttons and I want to set your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m43s)

[elevation to zero and I want to see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m45s)

[I now no longer understand this comment](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m54s)

[the margin applied because this is in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m57s)

[the button stack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h17m59s)

[is there to ensure there's enough room](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m00s)

[for the drop shadow of the buttons in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m02s)

[the stack panel the Deep](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m04s)

[uh for the default style pop-up this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m06s)

[not likely an issue which you can name](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m08s)

[the card blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m10s)

[and it simply provided the content as](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m14s)

[shown so in cases like these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m16s)

[so this makes sense that the buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m21s)

[need to have uh some space so that their](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m23s)

[drop shadow shows but again it goes back](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m26s)

[to the idea of these buttons don't have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m28s)

[a drop shadow applied to them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m32s)

[they're getting the defaults based upon](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m37s)

[being a button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m39s)

[uh and actually more importantly the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m42s)

[defaults these buttons are getting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m44s)

[because you'll know these don't have a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m45s)

[style set to them the the the styles on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m46s)

[these are actually coming from](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m50s)

[see it is inside of here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m53s)

[where is it one of these things has a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h18m57s)

[one of these things has a specific set](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m02s)

[of resources for buttons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m05s)

[uh where is it where is it there is a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m10s)

[specific](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m13s)

[button set up in here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m15s)

[there's tool tip ah here it is yeah so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m18s)

[buttons inside or this is toggle button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m21s)

[where is where is button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m23s)

[which I can just Hunt Target type button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m27s)

[in here and find it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m29s)

[uh yeah so this guy here is just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m33s)

[straight up setting Target type of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m37s)

[button on here is this inside the right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m39s)

[one that's pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m41s)

[uh where is it one of these things in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m44s)

[here which is how they're getting that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m47s)

[rounded state is they are intentionally](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m48s)

[oh this is inside of the pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m52s)

[this guy might be the one doing it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m55s)

[uh but this is inside of the card which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m57s)

[is inside the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h19m59s)

[which seems to be the wrong place](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m03s)

[somewhere in there there is a style that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m06s)

[intentionally changes it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m08s)

[I mean I will give a thumbs up but I I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m13s)

[think there's an outstanding question of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m15s)

[whether that elevation should be applied](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m16s)

[to both we've kind of already looked at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m19s)

[these this is great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m21s)

[a bunch of pre-canned values so you can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m24s)

[play with it great great great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m26s)

[the other thing that I wonder is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m30s)

[these are showing the um the property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m33s)

[names as they exist](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m36s)

[probably better I I was wondering if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m39s)

[there should be spaces or not but it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m41s)

[like yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m42s)

[these lined up more accurately with what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m44s)

[the the content is going to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m46s)

[so we're gonna good pop-up box there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m50s)

[our converters we're gonna push those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m54s)

[changes here in a minute uh does](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m55s)

[material design exam will work on net](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h20m59s)

[malware it does not at present](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m00s)

[um there's been a lot of requests to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m04s)

[Port it to various](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m05s)

[um other platforms](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m08s)

[um initially it was xamarin forms that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m10s)

[people had asked for and I had pushed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m13s)

[back on porting it to xamarin forms](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m16s)

[because xamarin forms had their material](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m18s)

[style or not what was it material](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m20s)

[element](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m23s)

[they had a way of setting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m24s)

[um the the theme to material design](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m26s)

[material design being Google's TV](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m29s)

[um which was good-ish right it got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m32s)

[people most of the way there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m35s)

[um it got crazy with funky controls and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m38s)

[whatnot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m41s)

[um I don't think Maui would be my first](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m43s)

[Target](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m46s)

[um I do suspect in the next year or two](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m48s)

[we're probably going to need to start do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m50s)

[working on ports to other platforms but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m52s)

[the the top Runners are gonna either be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m56s)

[when you I or uh avalonia those I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h21m59s)

[are the top Runners that I would](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m04s)

[consider going to next](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m05s)

[um only because they they kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m11s)

[overlap a little bit better the other](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m13s)

[thing is is with Maui I I somewhat](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m15s)

[expect I would end up in competition](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m18s)

[with Microsoft and they've got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m20s)

[they've got a lot more resources to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m24s)

[throw at the problem than I do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m26s)

[so this Library really has done so well](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m28s)

[because it feels a need that there isn't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m31s)

[there isn't a good solution right WPF if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m35s)

[you want material design theming there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m38s)

[only a handful of solutions out there I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m41s)

[know some of the paid libraries have a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m43s)

[material design theme that's as that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m45s)

[an option](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m47s)

[um but as for open source I don't think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m49s)

[you can find a better uh material design](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m52s)

[theme for WPF in this Library](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m55s)

[um in fact it's hard pressed to find](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h22m59s)

[really good WPF theming libraries and I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m00s)

[would like I'm biased but I'd say this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m04s)

[is one of the good ones right my apps is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m07s)

[obviously another one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m09s)

[um any of like the controls the X](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m11s)

[related libraries like the ribbon one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m13s)

[um are pretty good](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m16s)

[um especially for free open source stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m18s)

[like those those I I would say are the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m20s)

[uh what I would argue are the the top](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m24s)

[runners](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m27s)

[okay I think I played around enough with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m29s)

[this to agree that these that the mass](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m32s)

[in there is correct or at least close](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m34s)

[enough to correct that I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m37s)

[see it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m39s)

[um Okay so uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m40s)

[uh one thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m43s)

[that seems](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m45s)

[odd](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m48s)

[is the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m49s)

[elevation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m51s)

[property is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m52s)

[Y in consistently](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h23m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m00s)

[see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m01s)

[inconsistently to either the Ogle button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m03s)

[or the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m08s)

[uh pop-up content](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m10s)

[pending on the style](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m12s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m19s)

[a couple options uh let's see one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m22s)

[we have two properties one for the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m25s)

[toggle button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m30s)

[and one for the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m32s)

[and I almost wonder if that's the option](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m35s)

[that's better two we uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m38s)

[adjust the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m43s)

[samples so that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m49s)

[um and I can kind of see a third option](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m54s)

[that's a little weird where you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m56s)

[you apply the elevation property at the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h24m59s)

[pop-up box and you let that flow down](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m01s)

[but then let people override it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m08s)

[in in one of the templates for either](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m09s)

[the pop-up content or the toggle button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m11s)

[because those are technically things so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m13s)

[it's like a uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m14s)

[oh and thank you Justin Bieber for the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m19s)

[the kind words I I can't take full](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m21s)

[credit for this and like honestly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m23s)

[like this year Nikolai is I I think he's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m26s)

[going for MVP and he's he's pretty much](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m31s)

[killing it at the moment](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m33s)

[um he's got more PR's into this than I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m36s)

[do so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m38s)

[yeah okay next item](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m40s)

[next time I wanted to get to the the 5-0](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m43s)

[stuff we'll see uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m45s)

[you're much better than marking files as](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m49s)

[views I seem to go through all files and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m51s)

[realize I forget to mark them I I have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m52s)

[gotten in the habit of marking files as](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m54s)

[viewed when I go through PR's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h25m57s)

[um it's unless I think that I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m00s)

[Mark the the pr as approved and merged](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m02s)

[right away it's just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m05s)

[if there's more than like two or three](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m07s)

[files I immediately start doing this oh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m09s)

[I need to push my changes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m11s)

[uh let's look at these real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m18s)

[uh small cleanup done brain](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m21s)

[uh uh review on Boom commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m27s)

[push Nikolai almost always leaves this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m32s)

[stuff open for me to push back to which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m34s)

[is great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m36s)

[here we go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m37s)

[okay uh boom and then then when it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m39s)

[refreshes we then see the uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m43s)

[the changes come in and I think I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m47s)

[gonna leave those unviewed because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m48s)

[there's probably some back and forth](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m50s)

[that needs to happen there but yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m51s)

[definitely anybody doing code reviews](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m54s)

[use the check boxes every code review](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m57s)

[tool worth it salt has](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h26m59s)

[that or the equivalent](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m01s)

[okay so this was the one that came up in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m04s)

[the feedback](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m10s)

[so this is here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m13s)

[so the idea so the question here is what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m17s)

[should the hints do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m20s)

[right should hint be considered part of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m22s)

[the content or not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m28s)

[I didn't change the style in the example](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m36s)

[above much the problem persists if I use](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m39s)

[the standard uh so very convenient and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m41s)

[one points points of water to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m45s)

[oh boy I'm not gonna try the name to the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m48s)

[reporter](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m51s)

[um oftentimes I get bugs like this and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m52s)

[people forget to include what they've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m54s)

[done in their app this is helpful this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m56s)

[is really helpful to know exactly what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h27m58s)

[she's set up right so he's got some text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m01s)

[boxes here's the base style that he's on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m03s)

[he has applied some margin some font](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m05s)

[weight some font size which you can kind](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m08s)

[of guess at looking at that it's like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m10s)

[okay great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m12s)

[um and then updated the the font size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m14s)

[for the validation so I'm guessing on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m16s)

[some of these text boxes he's probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m19s)

[got binding validation or similar turned](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m20s)

[on great great great great the problem](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m23s)

[looks a bit like these ish uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m25s)

[uh looks a bit like these issues but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m28s)

[these are closed so let's take a quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m30s)

[Gander at these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m32s)

[yeah this is slightly different because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m35s)

[this is specifically around the floating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m38s)

[state of the hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m40s)

[and you'll note this one here the hints](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m42s)

[aren't floating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m44s)

[I guess that one's floating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m45s)

[but these ones down here are not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m49s)

[let's see floating hint of text boxy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m52s)

[this once again is it's floating and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m54s)

[being cropped](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m57s)

[because question becomes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h28m59s)

[uh uh is eluded your layout uh so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m02s)

[the glass for the the xaml](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m07s)

[uh are in a reactive UI user control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m11s)

[uh but I have this issue with all my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m15s)

[programs uh share a common file that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m17s)

[also included below excellent excellent](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m19s)

[this this line right here love that line](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m22s)

[love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m26s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m29s)

[so this is going in there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m32s)

[so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m37s)

[not bringing in the whole of the library](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m39s)

[just bringing in the text box style](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m41s)

[perfect that's fine](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m46s)

[which sometimes people forget that you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m49s)

[can do this you don't have to take the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m50s)

[library wholesale if you don't include](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m52s)

[the defaults resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m54s)

[you're on your own to then bring in the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m56s)

[resource dictionaries you do care about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m58s)

[but you can piecemeal like one of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h29m59s)

[projects I work on during my day job](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m02s)

[this is exactly what we do is we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m04s)

[piecemeal in the library and just bring](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m05s)

[in the bits we care about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m07s)

[like maybe we don't want to style the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m09s)

[whole app maybe we only want to style](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m11s)

[parts of it okay great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m12s)

[import what makes sense](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m15s)

[uh let's see data template](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m18s)

[so these I assume are the text boxes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m23s)

[there's the text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m25s)

[uh let's see lab assistant physician](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m29s)

[assistant physician assistants](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m32s)

[oh so this this looks like something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m36s)

[that's medically related that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m38s)

[terrifying that is utterly terrified](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m40s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m50s)

[shared xaml file oh there we go oh okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m53s)

[so also using my apps bringing in the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m56s)

[bundle theme](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h30m59s)

[doing the need soul](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m01s)

[got a bunch of extra stuff brought in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m03s)

[for some of the uh for icons and whatnot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m06s)

[great great great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m13s)

[this grid here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m18s)

[uh so the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m34s)

[uh the hint gives information](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m43s)

[uh let's see I don't think technical](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m50s)

[crazy isn't being rendered in a canvas](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m52s)

[uh yeah so there is a good point being](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h31m58s)

[made here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m01s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m02s)

[doesn't make sense so the other thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m05s)

[that gets weird is when you do a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m07s)

[floating hit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m10s)

[should that count for the control size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m11s)

[so because in WPF controls there's two](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m14s)

[sizes that matter there's the layout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m17s)

[size and the rendered size so the layout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m19s)

[size is how much space the control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m22s)

[should be given in the layout which is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m25s)

[kind of what's at play here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m30s)

[is the layout size is being shrunk and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m34s)

[brought in the hint gets interesting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m36s)

[because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m39s)

[especially with like a floating hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m40s)

[should that count towards the layout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m42s)

[because in order it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m45s)

[and then at what point should it count](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m47s)

[towards the layout because there's the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m50s)

[uh animation this this is where things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m52s)

[get weird real weird right of uh what is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m55s)

[it feels yeah let's go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h32m59s)

[so this is a this is a perfect example](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m03s)

[right is this floating hit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m05s)

[right and if we if we grab this guy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m08s)

[should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m12s)

[the text box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m14s)

[size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m17s)

[should this count towards its size right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m19s)

[because this guy here is being governed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m22s)

[I think he's inside of a grid with a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m24s)

[fixed width or with a column fixed with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m26s)

[but the comment here is also around](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m30s)

[localization because localization](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m32s)

[uh localization and fixed sizes do not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m35s)

[work](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m38s)

[Visual Studio team localization and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m39s)

[fixed sizes do not work right so for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m42s)

[example for example let's just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m46s)

[hypothetically](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m47s)

[right see see this see this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m51s)

[see this garbage](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m56s)

[big sizes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h33m58s)

[don't work](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m00s)

[anyway I have a runny so for those who](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m03s)

[who don't notice I tend to bump the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m06s)

[environment font size of my visual](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m09s)

[studio up I do a lot of like screen](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m11s)

[sharing presentations and I find that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m13s)

[it's just easier if I bump my entire](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m16s)

[font size up I've kind of just gotten](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m18s)

[used to coding that way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m20s)

[no my eyes aren't that bad but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m22s)

[like if my font seems huge it's because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m26s)

[I tend to run them at a larger size for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m29s)

[presentations and then either forget to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m31s)

[change them back or I'm just too lazy to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m33s)

[change the back both are possible](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m35s)

[but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m37s)

[so this poster makes some very good](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m39s)

[points that especially with localized](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m41s)

[content](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m44s)

[sizing of it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m46s)

[gets to be really weird but I don't know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m49s)

[whether](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m52s)

[so I I'm kind of inclined to think that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m54s)

[the hint belongs to the rendered size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m57s)

[not the layout size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h34m59s)

[meaning this hint can can float above](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m02s)

[where it's rendered but that does seem](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m06s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m09s)

[I I get the problem with localization](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m10s)

[because the moment you say it's a fixed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m13s)

[size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m15s)

[and that that is a tough one I think I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m17s)

[need to think on that for a minute let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m19s)

[see question there are libraries that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m21s)

[add observable concurrent stack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m23s)

[concurrent collection concurrent King](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m25s)

[use and use lock monitor inside](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m27s)

[themselves should they use them or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m30s)

[should I fix uh monitors to some for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m32s)

[slim ah so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m35s)

[uh great question](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m38s)

[um without an easy answer so I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m41s)

[uh let's see and current](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m47s)

[right so these ones here right so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m51s)

[concurrent stack uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m54s)

[object](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h35m58s)

[thank you right so these guys here so in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m00s)

[general if these classes work for you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m09s)

[and are what you want you should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m10s)

[probably use them because in a lot of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m12s)

[cases these things will do their](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m15s)

[absolute best](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m18s)

[to avoid needing to lock](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m20s)

[so their locks are actually somewhat](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m23s)

[expensive because when you do the lock](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m26s)

[keyword right uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m28s)

[just move it up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m33s)

[right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m34s)

[that lock keyword is kind of roughly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m36s)

[equivalent to doing something with like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m39s)

[uh the monitor class because there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m41s)

[like monitor try enter uh you know stack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m43s)

[all of the all of this jazz](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m52s)

[yeah and then there's there's this but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m56s)

[then you have to deal with the tri enter](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h36m59s)

[return your true and false like it gets](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m00s)

[it gets complex](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m02s)

[um and so the lot of those ones will](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m04s)

[avoid locks as much as possible which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m06s)

[will make them by far more performant](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m07s)

[they aren't perfect in all situations](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m10s)

[and sometimes you need that lock to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m12s)

[exist in a larger scope](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m15s)

[and so sometimes it's actually more](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m17s)

[efficient to not use them use like a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m19s)

[regular stack or list or whatever and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m22s)

[lock outside if you need](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m27s)

[if you need more concurrency](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m27s)

[synchronization that's bigger but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m29s)

[there's not a hard and fast one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m30s)

[um collections need observable events ah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m33s)

[so there is so specifically around](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m37s)

[observable events so if you have an](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m40s)

[observable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m42s)

[collection](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m43s)

[uh like this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m47s)

[so typically the thing that bites people](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m49s)

[with observable collections is you can't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m51s)

[mutate them on a background thread](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m54s)

[which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m56s)

[like for example away task](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h37m57s)

[you know uh yield or somewhere right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m01s)

[like this is a great easy way to go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m05s)

[ahead and shoot yourself in the foot](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m08s)

[something like this there is there is a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m09s)

[dirty trick that you can do so this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m11s)

[specific to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m15s)

[uh observable collection](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m16s)

[but binding operations so you can do a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m19s)

[enable collection synchronization](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m22s)

[I should say it's specific there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m29s)

[right so you can't so rather than doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m30s)

[the Locking yourself](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m33s)

[um if what you're building is some sort](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m36s)

[of mvvme style application and you've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m38s)

[got like observable collection](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m40s)

[um this binding operations will go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m43s)

[through and it will handle](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m46s)

[effectively doing what you kind of want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m48s)

[to do already right locking on the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m50s)

[collection so that you can mutate it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m53s)

[from background threads](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m55s)

[or before The Binding goes to read items](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h38m57s)

[off of it the binding will then make](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m00s)

[sure to acquire a lock on this object](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m02s)

[before it actually you know iterates and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m05s)

[that kind of thing so it Dodges all of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m07s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m09s)

[it it allows the thing to be mutated](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m10s)

[from any thread knowing that the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m12s)

[bindings are now going to lock on it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m15s)

[appropriately before acting on it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m16s)

[now with that said the the obvious](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m20s)

[problem with just blindly doing this all](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m23s)

[over the place is it slows things down](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m25s)

[locks are slow so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m27s)

[but a lot of times for my view models I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m30s)

[find that this is a pretty common setup](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m34s)

[um because I end up needing that kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m39s)

[thing a lot so depending on what](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m41s)

[depending on what you're doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m50s)

[yeah so if you're building an mvvm style](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m52s)

[application this binding operations](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m54s)

[enables synchronization is probably the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h39m57s)

[easiest way to go about doing it the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m00s)

[other the other ways that you end up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m03s)

[doing it with like the concurrent stack](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m04s)

[and that kind of thing get yucky fast uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m06s)

[especially if what you want is something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m09s)

[with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m13s)

[events I find that oftentimes if I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m14s)

[using one of these other collection type](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m17s)

[situations these are usually for the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m19s)

[processing of the data](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m23s)

[and this is for the display of the data](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m25s)

[so oftentimes if I'm you know doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m28s)

[computational stuff I'll I'll leverage](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m31s)

[like the the concurrent stack or regular](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m33s)

[stack or whatever and then at the very](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m35s)

[end](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m37s)

[I'll deal with pushing things over](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m41s)

[duplicate objects appear in the regular](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m43s)

[observable collection because of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m45s)

[asynchrony got it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m46s)

[um that is very likely fixed with this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m48s)

[then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m51s)

[right though if though if you've got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m52s)

[multiple threads that are doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m55s)

[something like you know if collection](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h40m57s)

[uh contains right uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m00s)

[new object](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m05s)

[right and then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m06s)

[stop it stop it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m08s)

[right you could imagine doing something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m11s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m15s)

[The Binding operations won't save you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m26s)

[this just verifies that every call](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m30s)

[this just verifies that every call to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m32s)

[your collection is synchronized not that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m34s)

[there's any synchronization between the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m37s)

[contains and the ad because if you have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m39s)

[multiple threads that are invoking a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m42s)

[block like this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m43s)

[thread ache and B could both check](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m45s)

[contains at the same time they both say](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m47s)

[yep](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m49s)

[contains as false okay we both add and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m50s)

[then you still get a dupe that comes in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m53s)

[so this is one of those situations where](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m55s)

[if you're if you end up needing logic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h41m58s)

[like this where](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m00s)

[um I would advocate for managing a lock](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m02s)

[outside of it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m05s)

[or similar this is by far the easiest](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m07s)

[option right is if you've got some logic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m10s)

[that really needs synchronized access go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m13s)

[ahead and use a lock like yes locks are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m16s)

[slower](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m18s)

[but the the rule of thumb is make it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m19s)

[work make it right make it fast](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m22s)

[once you get to step two make it right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m25s)

[put in the locks make it fast you can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m28s)

[look at techniques that involve avoiding](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m31s)

[locks but at least for the collection](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m33s)

[stuff this is much easier](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m38s)

[I'm a suck at C sharp](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m42s)

[leave the layer don't no don't worry](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m44s)

[about there are so many apis in inside](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m47s)

[of net and the BCL](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m53s)

[I don't know if in my entire career I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m54s)

[ever gone more than like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h42m58s)

[a month or two without learning about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m00s)

[some new awesome API and the moment you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m02s)

[think you've learned them all new things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m05s)

[are being added so don't worry there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m07s)

[always going to be stuff you don't know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m08s)

[uh then a question two objects come](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m11s)

[because of asynchronous we do not know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m13s)

[what order they came in and how to know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m15s)

[which is last uh contains the last valid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m17s)

[ah that is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m24s)

[so that that one may come down to a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m31s)

[little bit of domain knowledge stuff uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m33s)

[what's an API](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m37s)

[um let me look uh so what you uh let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m39s)

[see uh C sharp](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m42s)

[channels](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m45s)

[I don't know what this one is that one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m50s)

[looks interesting this is what I was](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m52s)

[looking for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h43m56s)

[uh this actually looks rather](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m06s)

[interesting so here drop the link](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m07s)

[discover this repo so no idea but that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m11s)

[that looks interesting so it sounds like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m15s)

[what you may be running into](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m18s)

[and so depending on what and again so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m21s)

[your question Justin Bieber about which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m24s)

[way to handle this so much is going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m25s)

[depend on your exact application but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m28s)

[oftentimes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m31s)

[it kind of sounds like what you are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m33s)

[describing is some sort of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m36s)

[producer consumer model](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m44s)

[and if that's the case this Channel's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m47s)

[API is actually really nice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m50s)

[um specifically about doing this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h44m54s)

[uh the idea being that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m02s)

[um if you've got something that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m05s)

[producing data right and you want to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m07s)

[know which which one came in last](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m09s)

[um one of the common patterns is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m12s)

[effectively shoving things into a queue](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m14s)

[right that way there's some semblance of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m16s)

[ordering](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m18s)

[um if you really do have two threads](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m20s)

[that are just arbitrarily producing data](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m22s)

[and you need to know which one's the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m24s)

[latest](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m26s)

[you kind of have to have the data drive](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m27s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m30s)

[because latest could be very arbitrary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m31s)

[otherwise if you don't have any sort of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m34s)

[reference point](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m35s)

[are you making a.net Maui app not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m37s)

[currently currently powwowing and WPF](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m43s)

[no so the channels can be used for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m45s)

[anything they're kind of this arbitrary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m48s)

[cue pattern so I I most recently used](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m50s)

[them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m55s)

[uh I was building a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m55s)

[um asp.net core web API project](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h45m59s)

[and I and I get pounded with requests](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m02s)

[right they come firing in and the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m04s)

[requests all basically](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m07s)

[um their their fire and forget from the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m10s)

[the caller side but they basically uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m13s)

[caused the service to need to do some](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m17s)

[amount of work and so what I ended up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m18s)

[doing was throwing them into one of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m21s)

[these channels to force the work through](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m23s)

[in order because that you can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m29s)

[build up a channel and then spin one or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m29s)

[more receivers very uh what is the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m33s)

[I think there's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m37s)

[I think if you just search this guy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m39s)

[uh oh Cornell this one's probably very](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m43s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m47s)

[the the idea of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m52s)

[consumer producer model works really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m53s)

[well](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m56s)

[we're dealing with kind of this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m57s)

[multi-threaded situation where you're](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h46m59s)

[not really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m02s)

[you're not really single threading it by](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m04s)

[pushing it back into this pattern](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m06s)

[because you could have multiple](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m07s)

[producers and multiple consumers but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m09s)

[your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m12s)

[um effectively ordering them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m14s)

[so that there's some some way of pushing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m16s)

[them through so in my case I ended up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m19s)

[pushing them through a channel so that I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m21s)

[could have one or more consumers process](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m22s)

[those requests and deal with them one at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m24s)

[a time](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m26s)

[to give it some sort of ordering so it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m28s)

[doesn't so you can use this regardless](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m31s)

[of whether things are on the internet](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m33s)

[even though it's called channels the the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m35s)

[basic building blocks under the hood are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m37s)

[all just in-memory constructs so you can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m39s)

[use this for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m42s)

[anytime you have multiple producers and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m45s)

[or consumers](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m48s)

[think of it the other term I've heard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m52s)

[people use is uh like fan out or fan in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h47m54s)

[and then the the only other thing then](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m02s)

[comes is you know what do you do when](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m04s)

[things get](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m05s)

[uh full mode Behavior so there are some](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m07s)

[weird things to be aware of uh with with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m11s)

[building these things up but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m13s)

[they are they are highly highly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m17s)

[performant](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m20s)

[so check those out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m22s)

[um that linked our this uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m25s)

[GitHub repo looks interesting like I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m28s)

[said I haven't read it can't say for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m30s)

[sure](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m32s)

[okay going back to this question of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m34s)

[should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m37s)

[Tech spot should they hint on a text box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m39s)

[scale its size and when should it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m44s)

[I think I'm coming around to the idea](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m52s)

[that the hit should factor into the size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m54s)

[it's really odd though right like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h48m59s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m09s)

[it's really hard to say](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m11s)

[I'm also noticing this thing is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m16s)

[this thing is no longer wrapping and is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m21s)

[extend](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m23s)

[I think we've got a bug in our uh demo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m25s)

[app this uh text box should not be uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m29s)

[that wide](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m32s)

[is there something down here that pushed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m34s)

[it that way no](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m36s)

[I think we've probably just messed up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m37s)

[our grid this text box should not be uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m39s)

[like 800 pixels wide I think the hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m41s)

[should probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m45s)

[should probably be considered as part of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m48s)

[the layout size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m50s)

[the the part that I'm really hung up on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m53s)

[though is the idea of floating him right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m56s)

[so for example comment here this is an](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h49m58s)

[easy one to say that oh yes of course](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m02s)

[comment should be part of the layout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m04s)

[size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m06s)

[right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m17s)

[and the helper text is clearly part of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m18s)

[the layout size so because we can see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m21s)

[this green border that show me the xaml](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m23s)

[draws on it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m25s)

[it's clearly allocated space for it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m27s)

[and floating hint appears to have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m33s)

[allocated space for it to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m35s)

[if we allocate space for the floating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m45s)

[hint to go above the text box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m48s)

[I would say that it makes sense](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m52s)

[maybe I'll phrase this differently if](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h50m58s)

[the layout size factors in the float for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m00s)

[the the hint it makes perfect sense that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m03s)

[the size of the text box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m07s)

[should accommodate the hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m10s)

[when it's not floating](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m14s)

[such as this wi-fi window](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m16s)

[it is really tough to say though because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m23s)

[things like validation don't we have a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m26s)

[validation when yeah like validation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m28s)

[that's done in a door that's at the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m35s)

[adorner layer so the validation can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m37s)

[float over the top of things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m38s)

[like it's either in the adorner layer or](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m41s)

[we've got a switch that lets you toggle](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m43s)

[it into a pop-up but in either case it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m45s)

[outside the the tree that your text box](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m48s)

[would be laid out in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m51s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h51m53s)

[I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m02s)

[I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m03s)

[do see the point I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m07s)

[think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m11s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m27s)

[yeah because the two cases here right is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m39s)

[if we let the hint and the helper text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m41s)

[count towards the size that means they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m45s)

[could scale the size of the item bigger](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m47s)

[than anticipated](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m50s)

[right because that's that's the two](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m52s)

[cases right if they don't count the item](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m53s)

[can shrink smaller than anticipated](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m56s)

[which is what this bug is reporting but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h52m58s)

[if they do count towards the layout size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h53m00s)

[then they could increase the size of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h53m02s)

[item beyond what is expected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h53m05s)

[whether they do in such cases on the web](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h53m12s)

[that is a good question](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h53m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h53m18s)

[takeaways what's new](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m26s)

[uh implementations](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m32s)

[web planned not helpful guys not helpful](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m42s)

[those don't count those don't count](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m46s)

[those don't count the ones with the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m48s)

[borders don't count because those ones](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m49s)

[clearly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m53s)

[my opinion of the documentation yes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h54m55s)

[see to some degree this has gotten to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m05s)

[less of a thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m08s)

[because they've added](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m13s)

[they've kind of dropped the plain text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m16s)

[box in favor of these other ones](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m18s)

[and the Border ones I don't consider](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m24s)

[counting because those don't really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m26s)

[have the same situation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m30s)

[I'd love to see one without it so that I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m38s)

[could compare and contrast](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m40s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m46s)

[fields](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m50s)

[text field](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m53s)

[oh yes okay run](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h55m57s)

[okay uh uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m04s)

[do you not show a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m08s)

[handling errors okay where's the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m15s)

[where's the hint bits uh by default it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m18s)

[has a decoration that draws a divider](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m21s)

[below the text field great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m23s)

[adding the label our icon](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m27s)

[so if we go there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m38s)

[uh where is their control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m42s)

[uh build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h56m47s)

[amen](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m01s)

[okay constant text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m04s)

[how does oh okay so that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m10s)

[great thank you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m20s)

[text field there okay so I really want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m26s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m28s)

[something because I want to do the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m29s)

[decoration](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m31s)

[right similar to what they showed there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m46s)

[hide](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m48s)

[so they've done that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h57m59s)

[so what happens if we drop this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m04s)

[run](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m08s)

[because I want to see without the Border](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m12s)

[I don't like how their alignment works](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m22s)

[and I am](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m37s)

[struggling to tell how the heck that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m39s)

[thing is sizing so we're gonna cheat](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m43s)

[uh flutter thank you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m45s)

[uh please don't be something stupid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m49s)

[uh come on let me in let me in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m52s)

[just want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h58m55s)

[how do I I want inside](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m00s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m05s)

[oh you're gonna make this hard on me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m14s)

[aren't you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m16s)

[you're gonna make this hard on me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m19s)

[why must you make this hard on me](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m22s)

[so it's being drawn on the shadow ah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m26s)

[so the short version hard to say hard to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m40s)

[say let's take a look at the figma](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m44s)

[uh open in figma](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m47s)

[hang on I don't know if I have a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m52s)

[sorry stand by while I check](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m57s)

[Authentication](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=01h59m58s)

[continue to file](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m03s)

[I think I can just get away with my free](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m05s)

[account](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m08s)

[yeah okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m13s)

[uh uh where is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m23s)

[seriously](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m27s)

[opponents](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m29s)

[that's what I want and I want text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m31s)

[fields](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m33s)

[see and this is where it's going to get](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m41s)

[really weird because we have a case that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m43s)

[isn't really covered here right because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m46s)

[they've got a background in all of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m48s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m49s)

[though I will say looking at these and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m50s)

[this might be the the key thing here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h00m54s)

[at least so I can't say horizontally but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m01s)

[at least vertically](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m05s)

[enough space is allocated for both the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m07s)

[floating hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m10s)

[as well as the text because this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m12s)

[background size is the exact same](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m15s)

[whether there's text whether the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m17s)

[keyboard focuses in it or not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m19s)

[so vertically space is allocated to the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m21s)

[layout size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m24s)

[so it would make sense that horizontally](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m26s)

[it would do the same thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m28s)

[I think I'm gonna go with that I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m33s)

[the answer is that we probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m35s)

[want to adjust the behavior so that both](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m38s)

[the hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m41s)

[and the help text](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m43s)

[both Al both are allocated and I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m45s)

[that might be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m49s)

[that might be more expected to people](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m53s)

[of having it grow too large because of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h01m57s)

[content they put in it versus shrink](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m00s)

[because I think it is easier for people](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m02s)

[to prevent an item from getting too big](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m05s)

[then an item from getting too small](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m08s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m17s)

[I mean the solutions are usually the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m20s)

[same in both cases in this case the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m22s)

[users using reactive which is making it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m24s)

[which is making the problem slightly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m27s)

[more difficult but it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m33s)

[yeah there is a thing though about](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m38s)

[sizing to content](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m41s)

[because fixed size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m43s)

[fixed size is is generally bad](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m48s)

[but I usually still advocate for rather](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m52s)

[than setting like width set Min width](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m55s)

[and Max width](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m58s)

[right and do let things resize](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h02m59s)

[appropriately that's one thing I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m02s)

[contemplated building is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m05s)

[um one of my colleagues made a comment](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m08s)

[to me a couple weeks ago that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m09s)

[there weren't a lot of people will build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m11s)

[plenty of theming libraries for WPF but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m13s)

[not a p a lot of people build layout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m16s)

[controls](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m18s)

[like that's one of the advantages of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m19s)

[like what Maui offers or even xamarin](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m22s)

[forms is they started building out](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m24s)

[various like layout panel controls](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m26s)

[because both IOS and Android are very](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m30s)

[opinionated in how you do layout and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m33s)

[there's pros and cons to every approach](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m36s)

[but they started building like their](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m37s)

[relative layout control which is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m39s)

[admittedly pain in the butt to use but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m42s)

[once you figure it out it's kind of nice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m44s)

[and there's no equivalent WPF and I I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m46s)

[started wondering if it would be worth](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m49s)

[building something like that out or I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m50s)

[often wanted like a uniform grid grid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m52s)

[wrap panel](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m56s)

[that doesn't exist like you have to roll](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h03m58s)

[that yourself and it would be kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m00s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m02s)

[to have some of those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m03s)

[layouty type controls that you could](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m05s)

[Leverage](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m08s)

[to some degree that's what reactive UI](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m09s)

[is giving you is that but it's uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m11s)

[what if uh they let you do both pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m15s)

[and adorner texts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m21s)

[so I don't think they so the the default](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m26s)

[material design thing I don't think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m29s)

[considers pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m31s)

[Ace the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m33s)

[there well we would call an adorner for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m36s)

[validation errors up here to also](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m39s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m43s)

[because we put the validation error at](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m47s)

[the bottom and this is one of those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m49s)

[cases where](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m50s)

[like material design lays out what they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m52s)

[want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m56s)

[but they ignore all UI Frameworks and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h04m56s)

[every UI framework is probably going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m00s)

[have something that's not covered here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m02s)

[which means you have to kind of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m03s)

[follow the guidance's intent rather than](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m06s)

[the letter because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m09s)

[they just didn't cover it right we've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m10s)

[got controls in WPF that they that they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m13s)

[don't list here and you can lock](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m15s)

[yourself into that but nobody nobody is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m17s)

[okay if we tell people hey by the way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m19s)

[you can't use the toolbar because they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m21s)

[didn't cover toolbars](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m24s)

[so you kind of just got to wing it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m31s)

[and I think in the case for like](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m35s)

[validation of pop-ups I'm very okay with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m37s)

[those not affecting the text Box's size](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m40s)

[because in order to get like the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m44s)

[you have to opt into that behavior](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m45s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m47s)

[I don't think there's any controls we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m48s)

[have where it's on by default](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m50s)

[and it's really only there for the cases](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m53s)

[where people are like hey I turned on my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m56s)

[validation error and it's being you know](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h05m58s)

[either trimmed or sitting where I don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m00s)

[want it it's like well yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m02s)

[because you're you're cropping it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m04s)

[because the the adorner can still get uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m06s)

[chopped because we don't as part of the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m10s)

[library we don't own the adorner layer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m12s)

[we can set adorner layers and Nest it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m14s)

[inside of a controls template but most](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m18s)

[of the time you want your adorner layer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m20s)

[higher up usually](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m21s)

[um the controls that add in a door layer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m24s)

[are window](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m26s)

[I believe user control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m28s)

[there's a handful of them that that put](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m31s)

[their own adorner layers in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m33s)

[that so when you render an adorner from](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m36s)

[inside of like our text box template](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m39s)

[it's going to go find the adorner layer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m40s)

[for it likely by walking up through its](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m42s)

[parent and finding one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m45s)

[and so we can set in a door in a layer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m47s)

[at a lower level but that's sometimes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m49s)

[not what you want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m51s)

[so yeah I think I'm gonna say this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h06m58s)

[should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m00s)

[I think I think I'm going to disagree](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m04s)

[with you on this one Nikolai and say I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m06s)

[think it should go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m08s)

[I I think the hints should affect the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m12s)

[layout size of the control](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m15s)

[and I think that'll be slightly more](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m19s)

[expected for some people](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m21s)

[okay one more thing I wanted to do I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m23s)

[want to get my 5-0 stuff brought forward](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m25s)

[and moving because I want to start](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m30s)

[working on those okay so pull up master](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m34s)

[so the other thing I might do real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m36s)

[is I might go disable that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m42s)

[flaky test that's giving me crap](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m46s)

[um because am I still on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m51s)

[I'll probably back up master real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m53s)

[oh hush now hush now Visual Studio I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m55s)

[hear you shut up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h07m58s)

[shut up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m00s)

[and what happens if the adorner air is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m04s)

[very long uh so it'll depend a little](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m06s)

[bit it probably](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m08s)

[um it probably gets clipped depending on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m11s)

[your layout](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m16s)

[which is why we have the pop-up option](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m17s)

[because once you move your error message](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m19s)

[into the pop-up it's now outside your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m22s)

[visual tree and can be as big as your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m24s)

[screen resolution allows](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m31s)

[which some people like some people don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m31s)

[and it's one of those it's an option](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m34s)

[turn it on if it makes sense](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m36s)

[but again with all of it it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m44s)

[the the library tries to not be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m48s)

[overly prescriptive](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m51s)

[in in telling you how you should do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m54s)

[things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m56s)

[because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m57s)

[there's always somebody who's going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h08m59s)

[have an edge case that I haven't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m01s)

[considered every time I've tried to put](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m03s)

[in something that's like you should do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m05s)

[it this way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m07s)

[somebody smacks me upside the head says](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m08s)

[no no no I can't do I we can't do that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m11s)

[because of X Y and Z it's like okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m13s)

[great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m15s)

[fine I get it I get it I get it it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m18s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m21s)

[um okay I really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m22s)

[Visual Studio what are you doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m27s)

[I know I changed branches and you've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m30s)

[lost your mind](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m32s)

[but it doesn't take that long to prepare](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m35s)

[a solution](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m37s)

[uh don't save](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m38s)

[if that Dialogue on a different Visual](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m41s)

[Studio instance was slowing this down](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m43s)

[I'm going to be really annoyed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m45s)

[are you actually doing something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m50s)

[are you actually doing something](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m54s)

[because you seem like you're just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h09m59s)

[sitting there not doing anything](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m01s)

[uh die](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m04s)

[okay let's try this again](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m07s)

[open solution this is not a hard](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m09s)

[operation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m12s)

[thinking](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m15s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m24s)

[that's a little terrifying](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m29s)

[I don't know which project you think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m31s)

[you've you didn't load because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m32s)

[that kind of looks like all the projects](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m36s)

[loaded](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m38s)

[okay okay so really what I'd like to do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m40s)

[is I think I'm going to just go disable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m42s)

[the test for the moment just so that we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m45s)

[could get the stuff out the door](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m47s)

[um because this is really annoying](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m50s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h10m54s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m05s)

[we might need to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m07s)

[install that but I don't think that's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m09s)

[overly necessary](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m13s)

[um it's the password box one with the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m14s)

[you just want to get the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m20s)

[that one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m25s)

[you are the one I want to disable](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m28s)

[until at least until such a time as I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m33s)

[can figure out why xaml test does not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m36s)

[want to play nice with this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m42s)

[uh let's see skip](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m44s)

[uh ignoring until I can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m47s)

[figure out why this doesn't work on the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m51s)

[uh GitHub actions Runner](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h11m58s)

[okay so we're just going to do that for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m03s)

[now](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m05s)

[uh great branch](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m06s)

[disabled](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m10s)

[uh sure great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m12s)

[my big head so it's not in the way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m16s)

[disabling uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m19s)

[plate key test](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m22s)

[drag drop push](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m26s)

[uh yeah sure I don't care which remote](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m30s)

[it goes to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m32s)

[boom boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m37s)

[oh this thing is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m49s)

[uh that's right still if I pushed it to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m51s)

[the other one it would have been better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m54s)

[because then it cracked it wouldn't have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m55s)

[lost its mind click the button](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h12m57s)

[create pull request](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m01s)

[technically put it in the Milestone I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m03s)

[guess enable auto merge confirm Auto](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m05s)

[merge](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m07s)

[and a week ago](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m10s)

[I don't go there that'll go there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m15s)

[hopefully that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m17s)

[deals with that problem](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m19s)

[clearly it passes sometimes because the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m22s)

[PRS were able to merge](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m25s)

[and then that one should go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m28s)

[uh Nikolai you may end up needing to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m33s)

[rebase this PR or merge the change in so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m35s)

[that you have that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m38s)

[uh okay speaking of rebase we are going](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m41s)

[to close the solution](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m44s)

[we are going to open this and we are](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m46s)

[going to rebase on master](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m49s)

[I'd like to take 5-0](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m52s)

[and I would like to let's see collapse](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m55s)

[you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m57s)

[I've got way too many local branches](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h13m58s)

[she clean some of these up okay and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m02s)

[we're just gonna straight up rebase](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m04s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m10s)

[boom first conflict](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m12s)

[okay so we probably want to blindly take](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m16s)

[master in almost every situation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m20s)

[there's like 11 conflicts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m26s)

[let's just take Master on everything](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m29s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m34s)

[yeah I think we're gonna take Master on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m42s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m44s)

[can you rebase](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m46s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m48s)

[so I want to go back and look which one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m49s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m51s)

[so is within selected value should be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m53s)

[dead so we I just want to go because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m56s)

[this is the one that was in conflict](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h14m58s)

[so we're gonna go make sure that's still](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m03s)

[cleaned up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m06s)

[then we'll push this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m08s)

[because I've been trying to keep the 5-0](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m10s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m12s)

[first time drinking Mountain Dew I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m15s)

[been trying to keep the 5-0 Branch up to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m17s)

[date](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m19s)

[so that it's not uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m20s)

[not straggling too far behind](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m25s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m28s)

[radiant](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m32s)

[because this was largely just layering](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m36s)

[out all of the obsolete bits](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m38s)

[format some stuff clean up some stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m46s)

[uh we probably have some issues here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m53s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m55s)

[so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h15m57s)

[is within selected value](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m01s)

[just hunt this guy real quick I I assume](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m04s)

[he's dead and we've probably just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m07s)

[accidentally whacked stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m08s)

[uh yeah so that's problematic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m11s)

[that is problematic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m16s)

[yeah because that little closing curly](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m27s)

[brace is going to be an issue](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m29s)

[so I think what we may want to do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m32s)

[is go back here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m36s)

[uh cancel reword let's just look at this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m39s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m42s)

[because I I assume the issue came](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m44s)

[uh uh let's see so that change is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m51s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m54s)

[that that's just expression body members](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m56s)

[that's fine there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h16m59s)

[this is the actual deletion](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m01s)

[that's the deletion the invert property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m05s)

[this is where things get weird](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m10s)

[uh Min property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m13s)

[coherz value callback](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m18s)

[I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m24s)

[think this is where the conflicts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m28s)

[occurred and that's incorrect](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m34s)

[this changed here so 364 is likely a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m39s)

[merge conflict so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m44s)

[I mean uh nope that's not where we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m47s)

[wanted to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h17m53s)

[yeah reading bar oh I'm probably looking](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m00s)

[at the wrong rating bar](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m03s)

[uh that one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m05s)

[three six four nope](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m08s)

[three six four](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m11s)

[so that curly brace is problematic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m14s)

[okay so that format's a little nicer so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m18s)

[that looks](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m20s)

[a little bit better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m22s)

[I'm guessing there is one more thing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m28s)

[that is off because otherwise](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m31s)

[this would be problematic so that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m33s)

[callback is missing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m36s)

[I think that's what we saw is it looked](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m38s)

[like the merge conflict](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m40s)

[wax something that shouldn't have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m42s)

[so let's do this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m47s)

[uh Crete Branch here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m54s)

[I want to go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m58s)

[so this is going to be a good example of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h18m59s)

[I want to clean up this commit so that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m01s)

[it's correct because I've done a rebase](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m04s)

[I've got merge conflicts I know this is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m06s)

[the one that I want to address so I've](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m09s)

[backed up to the one that's problematic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m11s)

[and I'm going to end up amending this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m13s)

[commit as we go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m17s)

[we're going to end up editing this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m18s)

[commit and then we're going to fix the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m20s)

[branch up so that it looks right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m21s)

[so this will be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m24s)

[a good lesson so that change looks fine](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m25s)

[okay so what else so 364 we know is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m28s)

[problematic this deletion is almost](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m31s)

[certainly problematic](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m34s)

[so 293](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m36s)

[Max property coheres Min property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m45s)

[changed coerce](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m49s)

[okay so let's go and look uh 293 or 277.](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h19m57s)

[g277](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m04s)

[okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m06s)

[Max property I'm just trying to figure](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m10s)

[out why these things are set so far](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m12s)

[separated from](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m14s)

[their actual things](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m17s)

[because this really should be up here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m21s)

[in my opinion](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m26s)

[should go there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m29s)

[then property changed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m31s)

[like in general I try to keep these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m34s)

[things together like I don't think these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m36s)

[things should be separated from each](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m38s)

[other and actually we should probably do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m40s)

[change then colors so that they line up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m42s)

[with the order that they are in the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m45s)

[property metadata great](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m46s)

[move that up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m49s)

[okay let's do Max real quick too because](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m51s)

[I saw that that one was wrong](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m53s)

[where did that go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h20m55s)

[uh where is I guess I saw the max value](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m02s)

[when I can just jump to its](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m06s)

[things uh Max Max property change](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m08s)

[callback](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m10s)

[yeah you cut](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m12s)

[go up here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m18s)

[we'll put you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m20s)

[there's the Callback and then the coerce](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m22s)

[is out of there cut](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m24s)

[scroll up to the red](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m28s)

[paste okay so there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m30s)

[so we're gonna come in here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m33s)

[we're gonna do this we're going to take](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m35s)

[this we're gonna go view changes stage](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m36s)

[amend amend previous commit okay so this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m38s)

[is the commit we're chasing and we're](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m41s)

[going to just beat this into submission](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m43s)

[and then we're going to put 5-0 back on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m44s)

[top of it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m49s)

[we've got those](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h21m58s)

[okay let's look at what the the next Air](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m01s)

[is that it's complaining about is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m03s)

[read-only property](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m06s)

[we've got two of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m10s)

[this is a dupe](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m14s)

[just make sure there was nothing weird](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m17s)

[about it type rating bar metadata](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m18s)

[default bull no those are those just got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m20s)

[moved around](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m22s)

[that caused a problem okay so this one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m23s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m25s)

[invalid member declaration](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m26s)

[so we've got this weird thing going on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m31s)

[with this for Loop so 318 level so let's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m33s)

[see what happened here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m40s)

[I believe we just want to take this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m54s)

[and whack all of that so we want the for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h22m57s)

[each in its place](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m00s)

[instead of all that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m02s)

[that's what it previously was](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m08s)

[um this all needs to die here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m12s)

[so I don't think we want any of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m16s)

[changes these are likely just conflicts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m19s)

[so 396](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m21s)

[02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:34,439](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m25s)

yeah so this is

[just a conflict](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m31s)

[we want to take](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m34s)

[this up and delete](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m36s)

[an indent](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m40s)

[okay and then we've got this return](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m42s)

[curly brace double offset](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m45s)

[turn curly brace double offset this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m48s)

[doesn't need to be here anymore that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m50s)

[goes away](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m51s)

[okay that Edition wasn't done](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m53s)

[this convert back should replace](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h23m56s)

[yeah I really want to just revert](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m04s)

[a lot of this so here's what we're going](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m06s)

[to do we're gonna stage all amend amend](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m08s)

[and then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m10s)

[create a revert commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m13s)

[because let me just let me just scroll](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m16s)

[down through the rest of this because I](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m17s)

[think these bottom changes I don't want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m19s)

[any of them](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m20s)

[yeah I don't want any change below line](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m25s)

[442. so we're gonna so we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m28s)

[drop all the changes so we're going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m31s)

[revert the commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m32s)

[leave them pending and so in this case](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m35s)

[what we want to do is we only want to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m37s)

[Stage the stuff that we want to get rid](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m39s)

[of so rating bar button is fine](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m41s)

[um and so we're going to come down here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m45s)

[and what we really want to do is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m46s)

[uh stage selected lines](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m49s)

[uh stage selected lines](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m53s)

[uh actually can I just scroll all the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h24m57s)

[way down](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m00s)

[uh stage selected lines](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m01s)

[okay so we're going to end up throwing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m04s)

[away all of that so then we amend amend](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m06s)

[and then discard above discard now we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m08s)

[look at the commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m12s)

[that should leave us with something that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m13s)

[looks like this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m15s)

[type](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m17s)

[now we come back over to visual studio](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m22s)

[and we see does this compile](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m24s)

[so these two guys should be deleted](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m26s)

[that goes away](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m29s)

[that goes away](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m31s)

[that was the actual change](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m33s)

[what's the air down here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m36s)

[too many closing braces](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m39s)

[right](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m42s)

[file](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m47s)

[let's make sure you actually build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h25m58s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m00s)

[as long as you build I think we'll be in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m02s)

[good shape](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m04s)

[then we'll go continue working on this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m07s)

[this is one of those areas with long](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m10s)

[running branches you end up with these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m12s)

[types of problems and they get annoying](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m13s)

[okay so we're gonna stage amend that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m15s)

[okay build succeeded okay perfect okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m22s)

[so back to get cracked so we've got](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m24s)

[ourselves in this situation right 5-0 is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m26s)

[now I don't know one two three four five](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m29s)

[commits ahead of this one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m31s)

[and this one here has a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m33s)

[uh a problematic commit so what we'd](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m37s)

[really like to do is take this one and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m40s)

[rebase it so if we go here we go here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m42s)

[and we rebase a 5-0 under Foo](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m45s)

[oh hold on abort commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m49s)

[uh uh let's see so but this commit here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m51s)

[is bad this is the one we want to get](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m55s)

[rid of so we really only want to rebase](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m57s)

[one two three four commits and we want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h26m59s)

[these four commits to be rebased on top](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m02s)

[of Foo so we drag here we go interactive](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m04s)

[rebase and we know this is the commit we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m07s)

[don't care about so we're going to drop](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m10s)

[this commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m11s)

[and then rebase the others](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m13s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m17s)

[and now we once again have the nice](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m19s)

[linear history with each of the 5-0](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m21s)

[changes in their own commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m24s)

[everyone's happy there we go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m27s)

[push](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m30s)

[because reasons](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m31s)

[I mean it's a rebate so we kind of have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m34s)

[to force push we can get rid of our food](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m35s)

[branch that I just used as a little](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m37s)

[Anchor Point and now I want to go grab](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m39s)

[my color thoughts one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m41s)

[um and I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m45s)

[so let's create branch](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m48s)

[back up](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m51s)

[and then I want to take color thoughts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m54s)

[because I really just want to go color](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m56s)

[thoughts reset to here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h27m57s)

[uh close one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m04s)

[Visual Studio is holding files and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m07s)

[causing cracking oh wow cracking crashed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m10s)

[bad Kraken don't crash I know I was](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m13s)

[changing files out from under you but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m16s)

[trust me it's okay it's okay I promise](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m18s)

[it'll be fine okay uh reset hard move my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m20s)

[color thoughts there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m24s)

[and then come back down to my backup](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m27s)

[and cherry pick the commit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m30s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m34s)

[and then take color thoughts and push it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m36s)

[and then that'll get that branch in sync](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m40s)

[of where I want it to be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m43s)

[okay because this is the one where we're](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m46s)

[doing the source generatory stuff and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m47s)

[away we go so](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m49s)

[okay those are pushed those are caught](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m51s)

[up I think that's in a better situation](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m53s)

[that gives me the ability to go through](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m55s)

[and look at it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h28m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m01s)

[uh perfect](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m02s)

[okay I may call it there before I dive](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m04s)

[In Too Deep I wanted to get into this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m06s)

[and I may go through and do this I think](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m09s)

[I want to work on getting 5.0 stuff done](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m11s)

[and out the door and then maybe](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m13s)

[contemplate looking at an alternate](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m15s)

[Target like I said when UI](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m17s)

[is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m20s)

[it's the one I want to do but avalonia](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m22s)

[might be better](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m24s)

[we'll see I think it might be a little](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m26s)

[more popular](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m28s)

[so I need to look into Abalone again](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m31s)

[because at one point when I first looked](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m34s)

[at it it didn't have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m36s)

[some of the the drawing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m38s)

[our animation capabilities that we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m40s)

[needed but the other thing is I could](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m43s)

[just lower my standards](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m46s)

[but I I it's come a long way since the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m49s)

[last time I looked at it so it's it's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m51s)

[not likely a problem okay oh sweet and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m53s)

[my disabled flaky test merged which](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m55s)

[means the pipeline passed with it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h29m58s)

[disabled so as much as I hate that uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m00s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m04s)

[real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m07s)

[uh boom](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m10s)

[push](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m12s)

[Force push Force push](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m14s)

[and then color thoughts](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m17s)

[rebase yes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m20s)

[Skip Skip Skip Skip Skip Skip Skip Skip](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m24s)

[Skip Skip skip](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m25s)

[I probably could have done the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m29s)

[interactive rebase and saved myself a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m31s)

[lot of trouble](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m32s)

[why are you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m35s)

[abort](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m38s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m42s)

[uh so we're just gonna I don't know why](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m46s)

[it's giving me such so so much crap go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m47s)

[there](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m50s)

[Cherry Picked the last commit yes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m51s)

[push](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m54s)

[push Force push don't think just push](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h30m56s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m00s)

[now it's very much in sync okay and I'm](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m02s)

[gonna clear out some of these dead](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m04s)

[branches](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m05s)

[so but I do want to get the theming](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m07s)

[stuff in and better because right now we](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m09s)

[are kind of in this awkward place where](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m11s)

[it's difficult to make certain changes](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m13s)

[um and there's a whole slew of bugs and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m16s)

[feature requests of hey it'd be really](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m18s)

[great if I could configure insert color](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m20s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m23s)

[um and I'd like to make that problem](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m24s)

[just die so that we have an easy way of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m26s)

[doing it like adding a brush should be](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m29s)

[as simple as adding it to some source of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m31s)

[Truth and then using it in the template](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m34s)

[it should be no harder than that and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m37s)

[everything should then just flow nicely](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m40s)

[right all the theming related bits](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m42s)

[should just be built for you it should](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m44s)

[be Source generated and everything](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m46s)

[should work that's what I want](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m48s)

[so that's the direction we're going to](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m50s)

[go](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m52s)

[uh uh yeah so I may end up doing that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m53s)

[next week just out of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m56s)

[rather getting sucked into pull requests](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h31m58s)

[as exciting as they are sometimes they](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m01s)

[get in the way of me actually doing](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m03s)

[stuff I want to work on not that they're](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m05s)

[bad it's just](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m08s)

[sometimes I want to go work on the fun](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m09s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m11s)

[so with that thank you everyone for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m12s)

[coming in hanging out uh it was fun for](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m15s)

[anybody who missed I will just pop the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m18s)

[little](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m21s)

[sample real quick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m22s)

[uh uh I don't have it hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m24s)

[hang on](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m27s)

[I intentionally thought I left it open](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m29s)

[so that I could show off my failure](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m31s)

[later](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m33s)

[so for reference this is in one of my](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m36s)

[projects I'm sorry I'm not proud of it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m38s)

[it's a bug I'm gonna go fix it but the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m40s)

[the the the brain teaser here is here's](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m44s)

[the pipeline or the GitHub actions](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m47s)

[workflow if we want to be real specific](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m49s)

[the the bug in question is the unit](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m51s)

[tests are not actually running](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m54s)

[so the question is why](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m56s)

[I'll leave that sitting there for just a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h32m59s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m01s)

[I'll scroll it down I promise](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m02s)

[there's that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m04s)

[and then proof is in the pudding](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m06s)

[if we go and look at the last successful](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m09s)

[run we can go and look](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m12s)

[we can see when we run the tests](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m14s)

[the test did nothing no tests were](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m17s)

[executed](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m19s)

[you can also see there's the build the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m21s)

[publish ended up working just fine and](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m24s)

[the hint here is you see all of these](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m27s)

[restoring commands in the publish](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m29s)

[so what is actually happening here is](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m31s)

[oh dang it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m37s)

[thank you Benjamin](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m40s)

[missed it okay sorry real okay back it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m42s)

[up rewind ignore everything I just said](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m46s)

[switching back](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m48s)

[so brain teaser from today was uh the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m50s)

[GitHub action on the left unit test not](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m54s)

[actually running](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m57s)

[so if anybody wants me to not do](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h33m58s)

[spoilers pause now before I get to him](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m01s)

[three two one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m03s)

[um the so on the right we can see that](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m06s)

[it ran or attempted to run.net test but](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m09s)

[it ended up doing zero tests we can see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m12s)

[there was a.net build command and we can](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m15s)

[see a publish and the hint here is with](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m18s)

[the publishing these restores because in](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m20s)

[theory a net restore shouldn't have been](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m22s)

[needed because the build should have](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m25s)

[done a restore when it compiled it](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m27s)

[so that's the first hint](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m30s)

[um as far as what's going on if we look](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m32s)

[at the the build command we can also see](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m34s)

[that there's not a lot of output here](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m37s)

[not nearly as much as you would expect](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m38s)

[from a.net build command the the answer](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m40s)

[is here is this dash dash version switch](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m43s)

[is dash dash version ends up telling you](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m45s)

[the version that you are running of.net](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m49s)

[and doesn't actually execute the build](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m53s)

[command in the least](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m55s)

[so attempting to specify version this](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h34m58s)

[way no workie do not do that so the the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m00s)

[actual solution is to use uh I don't](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m05s)

[have it open](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m09s)

[grab one](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m11s)

[uh let's see I think we're using Gilder](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m13s)

[as the example](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m16s)

[view code GitHub](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m21s)

[workflows Main](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m24s)

[so the actual solution](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m26s)

[is to do something like this with a uh a](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m28s)

[hyphen P](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m31s)

[which is uh for parameter so this is the](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m33s)

[same as specifying something inside of](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m36s)

[your property group in your CS project](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m38s)

[and then passing the version through](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m41s)

[that way there's more than one way](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m43s)

[inside of a CS project to specify your](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m45s)

[version there's things like version](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m47s)

[suffix as alternate properties as well](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m48s)

[so depending on what you're doing pick](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m51s)

[the one that matches in this case](https://youtu.be/Ir6p-5Be5Y0?t=02h35m53s)
