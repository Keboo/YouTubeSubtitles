[it how how it lands so maybe a stream](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m28s)

[next week assuming I'm enjoying coding](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m31s)

[I've been doing a lot of coding recently](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m34s)

[so um tonight going back to the material](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m36s)

[design flipper control last week got far](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m39s)

[enough to be confused and had a good](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m42s)

[think on it and have some approaches](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m45s)

[that I want to that I want to at least](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m47s)

[try we'll see how far we get um I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m49s)

[going to try to not run too late tonight](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m52s)

[I've uh got a video that's going to be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m54s)

[going Live on YouTube later probably two](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m56s)

[videos actually on the uh get cracken](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h00m59s)

[CLI so that doesn't make sense to you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m02s)

[and when I say CLI just to be clear I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m05s)

[not talking about this thing down here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m08s)

[at the bottom little embedded terminal](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m09s)

[talking about something cooler one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m11s)

[second show it to you oh I can show you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m14s)

[part of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m18s)

[it I can show you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m19s)

[the wonderful marketing page for it and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m21s)

[it is amazing and wonderful so uh quick](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m24s)

[synopsis this is if you are at home](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m27s)

[inside of a terminal doing all of your G](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m29s)

[stuff and you would like to augment that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m31s)

[with some of the more get ceny goodness](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m34s)

[um you know being able to group and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m37s)

[manage repositories at a workspace level](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m39s)

[type situation be able to have some sort](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m41s)

[of like uh Focus view for issues PRS](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m44s)

[that kind of thing this is a tool for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m47s)

[you so video forthcoming should be live](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m48s)

[in the next 24 hours uh it's currently](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m51s)

[December 20th 2023 so if you're watching](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m53s)

[a recording of this after that point go](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m56s)

[check out the YouTube It's it's it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h01m58s)

[there um should be out very very soon](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m00s)

[okay so uh we are going to take our](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m03s)

[flipper control speaking of my beloved](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m06s)

[get Kraken uh step one there's been a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m08s)

[number of things that have gone through](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m11s)

[specifically dependabot updated some](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m13s)

[stuff new get pack or new get uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m15s)

[automatically updated some icon stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m18s)

[great we like icons we're going to just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m20s)

[bring our flipper take two branch rebase](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m22s)

[on Master push and yeah Force push and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m25s)

[yes do it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m28s)

[okay so where we last landed on this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m31s)

[lovely flipper control is we had run](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m35s)

[into a situation where on the so we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m38s)

[we'll back up we'll just catch everyone](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m42s)

[up real quick so flipper control simple](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m44s)

[flipper control in material design they](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m47s)

[have a concept of like a card think of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m48s)

[it as like a a panel or some people call](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m50s)

[it maybe a border or similar right it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m53s)

[a it's a container that holds stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m55s)

[sometimes has elevation set on it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h02m58s)

[um we do elevation with uh aable the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m00s)

[break point for the moment we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m04s)

[elevation with the uh drop shadow effect](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m05s)

[in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m08s)

[WPF um but the idea here is you click it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m08s)

[and it flips I know fascinating that is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m12s)

[the name but the the the interesting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m16s)

[part is this case right here see these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m20s)

[ones are are somewhat easier](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m22s)

[because the controls aren't changing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m25s)

[size and you'll note here the size of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m29s)

[this one looks](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m31s)

[like uh or the the font on this looks](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m33s)

[garbage right most people report blurry](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m36s)

[font that sucks the other big limiting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m38s)

[factor with the current flipper control](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m41s)

[doesn't respond to theme changes that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m43s)

[sucks so we like this better right one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m45s)

[of these sets of text is much more](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m49s)

[readable than the other you can guess](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m51s)

[which one um so we're aiming for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m53s)

[something more like the right but with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m55s)

[the animation that looks more like the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m58s)

[left so that's what we're going for so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h03m59s)

[to get the animation we are leveraging](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m02s)

[the 3D apis inside of WPF they're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m05s)

[somewhat little known apis uh that don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m08s)

[get to see a lot of use because most of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m11s)

[the time if somebody's doing 3D stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m13s)

[they're probably building a game often](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m15s)

[um and so if you're building a game you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m19s)

[are probably pulling in some sort of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m22s)

[game engine because you probably want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m24s)

[some sort of like physics and the other](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m26s)

[stuff that the game engine give you yes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m28s)

[WPF can render the 3D stuff for you but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m30s)

[it's it's kind of like why would you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m34s)

[pick that when you could take something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m37s)

[that's actually built for building](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m39s)

[games can you build simple games in WPF](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m40s)

[yeah I've built little card games and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m43s)

[whatnot with it it's great works fine um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m45s)

[but if you get to something complicated](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m48s)

[where you're like doing 3D object stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m50s)

[you might want something with like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m52s)

[Collision detection and whatnot built in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m54s)

[that might be a thing so yeah so AP eyes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m56s)

[don't see much use but you can do some](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h04m59s)

[cool stuff like make things flip now the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m02s)

[limiting factor here and the the the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m05s)

[bane of the existence of why this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m08s)

[renders like crap is this visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m10s)

[right because when you do a visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m13s)

[in WPF it basically snapshots a UI](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m15s)

[element and gives you a a picture that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m18s)

[you can then go and drop on things um I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m20s)

[I meant to show off Snoop the other day](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m23s)

[because Snoop does this as well so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m25s)

[normally I show everybody grabbing the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m27s)

[uh the crosshairs next to the binoculars](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m28s)

[there's a second set of crosshairs](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m31s)

[because that's not confusing at all next](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m33s)

[to this magnifying glass right if you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m35s)

[drag that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m37s)

[on you'll note you get this um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m38s)

[visualization of it and then more](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m42s)

[importantly you can hit this 3D mode](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m44s)

[right and then you can start to do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m47s)

[maneuver this is this is one of those](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m49s)

[features of WPF that I feel like most](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m50s)

[people don't realize exists and you can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m53s)

[drag this slider here to kind of expand](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m56s)

[it out this is one of those those things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h05m58s)

[that is worth knowing about because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m00s)

[sometimes being able to visualize the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m02s)

[layers is incredibly powerful now you'll](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m05s)

[note something some of this and you can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m09s)

[change the background to make things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m11s)

[either stand out more or less depending](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m13s)

[on what you're doing you'll know this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m15s)

[thing here looks a little weird because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m16s)

[it's like hang on we don't have big](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m17s)

[black things sitting over the top of my](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m20s)

[thing we kind of do um I I probably need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m23s)

[to dig into it a little more but I would](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m27s)

[suspect drawer host and dialog host from](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m29s)

[the main window are probably where these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m31s)

[things are coming from because both of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m33s)

[those things have overlays that um sit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m34s)

[there but you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m37s)

[can make it dance right but this is the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m39s)

[type of stuff that you can do with wpf's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m42s)

[3D things that's great right like that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m45s)

[kind of this is kind of what we're going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m48s)

[for here but the the problem that we run](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m50s)

[uh that we run into here is while going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m54s)

[through and doing this we kind of need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m58s)

[to know how big this is because once you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h06m59s)

[do this you actually have to like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m02s)

[measure the size of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m04s)

[elements and the the problem that we ran](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m07s)

[into is how do you know how big the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m10s)

[other side of the flipper is until](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m13s)

[you've actually rendered it now here is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m15s)

[I have some working theories of things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m19s)

[that I want to just go play with and try](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m21s)

[but I think I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m23s)

[think we can do this with render trans](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m26s)

[I think not the animation but I think we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m30s)

[can use them and abuse them in order to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m33s)

[get a reasonable rendering of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m35s)

[control and capture the visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m38s)

[that's the game plan so stand by one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m40s)

[moment while I figure out which end is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m44s)

[up and where my terminal is because I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m46s)

[have lost it there's my happy terminal](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m49s)

[okay happy terminal uh CD temp uh M WPF](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m52s)

[render test we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h07m58s)

[CD yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m02s)

[uhet](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m05s)

[new](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m07s)

[uh uh that's not what I want that's what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m10s)

[I want pseudo make me a WPF](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m13s)

[app hey uh the base taka welcome hello](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m16s)

[hello we're going to play around with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m22s)

[the WPF visual brush that that that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m24s)

[what we're going to do so rather than](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m28s)

[fight with it inside of all of this 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m29s)

[stuff I'm just going to do it inside of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m33s)

[a brand new app real quick just so that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m35s)

[we can have something simple no extra](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m39s)

[weirdness going on none of that things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m42s)

[we don't need here we're GNA we're going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m45s)

[to do some stuff real quick we don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m48s)

[need unit test we aren't unit testing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m49s)

[we're going to literally just render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m52s)

[stuff straight up and we're probably](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m54s)

[going to even delete the view model who](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m55s)

[needs a view model okay uh uh great so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h08m56s)

[what I would like to do is I would like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m00s)

[to bring in uh let's just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m02s)

[do I think rather than this stack panel](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m06s)

[here we're going to switch this out for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m10s)

[grid grid great uh yeah I don't like any](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m12s)

[of that that all goes away uh don't like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m17s)

[any of that that all goes away why do I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m19s)

[have an empty image control in my](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m21s)

[template that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m23s)

[seems should fix that I think I did fix](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m24s)

[it I think I fixed it and then just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m27s)

[never pushed it uh also dumb uh so we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m28s)

[going to do a couple columns and we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m31s)

[just going to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m33s)

[uh your close copilot you're close](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m35s)

[you're close you got](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m37s)

[50% okay so left side we're going to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m40s)

[something like Border X name uh Target](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m43s)

[control actually you know what let's not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m47s)

[do a border let's do a a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m49s)

[card um or actually I usually call it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m53s)

[MDX don't I what we normally do boom](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h09m56s)

[okay so that just added the XML](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m00s)

[namespace somewhere boom you uh so we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m03s)

[will take a card let's inside of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m07s)

[card let's do a button uh content uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m09s)

[capture](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m14s)

[me okay I've had a little too much](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m18s)

[caffeine I think that's that's probably](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m20s)

[the fundamental plaw here uh let's do a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m22s)

[margin of 20 I just want to put some](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m25s)

[space around these things so that we can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m26s)

[kind of see them line up uh let's see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m28s)

[horizontal alignment center vertic no](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m32s)

[vertical alignment center because I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m35s)

[can't type doesn't mean it's wrong okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m38s)

[and then we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m41s)

[over on the right side we're going to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m43s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m45s)

[a uh let's just put another actually you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m46s)

[know what let's do this uh we'll just do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m50s)

[some row definitions here uh grid row](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m52s)

[definitions come on kop what am I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m56s)

[thinking of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h10m58s)

[ha see I'm still the developer co-pilot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m00s)

[cannot read my mind yet there we go okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m03s)

[so row](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m06s)

[definitions getting close but it's not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m08s)

[going to read my mind yet okay so we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m10s)

[going have a button](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m12s)

[uh visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m14s)

[brush and it's not even going to have a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m17s)

[command skip that grid Row](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m19s)

[one grid column one okay and then we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m23s)

[need a something to put a background on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m27s)

[for the visual brush because when you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m30s)

[get a brush the brush is worthless](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m32s)

[unless it's applied to something and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m34s)

[this is the important thing to note](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m36s)

[because in WPF brushes are things that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m38s)

[you paint with in this case this just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m40s)

[happens to be like a brush that's like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m42s)

[one of those uh temporary tattoos that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m45s)

[you're going to just roll on and kind of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m47s)

[like wallpaper the the thing with so uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m48s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m52s)

[a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m53s)

[border and we'll just set like the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m55s)

[background of it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h11m57s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m00s)

[name a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m02s)

[Target element and this really shouldn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m04s)

[be Target this should be like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m06s)

[source source element boom Target](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m08s)

[element grid column](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m13s)

[one grid row zero I know it's the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m16s)

[default but eh whatever uh okay and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m20s)

[then uh vertical alignment center](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m24s)

[horizontal alignment Center good and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m27s)

[then about my markup](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m31s)

[for because I haven't compiled yet it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m33s)

[because I haven't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m36s)

[compiled okay we got this great we've](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m39s)

[got this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m43s)

[here and we're going to hopefully take a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m46s)

[picture of this and put it here that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m49s)

[game plan that's game plan Okay click](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m51s)

[Handler uh let's see visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h12m56s)

[brush uh brush gets new uh Source](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m02s)

[element and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m08s)

[do that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m11s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m16s)

[huh noting that the brush has a view box](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m19s)

[okay co-pilot you're impressing me what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m22s)

[else do I want to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m25s)

[next absolute okay you're getting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m26s)

[close I mean I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m31s)

[guess okay now you've just lost your](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m34s)

[mind co-pilot we got to put this brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m36s)

[somewhere if we don't put it somewhere](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m38s)

[it's not going to be useful to anybody](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m39s)

[come on co-pilot pay attention pay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m41s)

[attention uh let's see if for copilot I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m44s)

[couldn't remember the name of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m47s)

[element I'm sure you did uh let's see so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m48s)

[we're going to do background gets brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m50s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m52s)

[okay because here's what we want to test](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m55s)

[we want to see what happens when we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h13m58s)

[apply transforms to this Source element](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m00s)

[what does that do to our brush and how](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m03s)

[can we abuse that to get the brush to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m05s)

[what we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m08s)

[want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m08s)

[okay that did absolutely nothing now I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m10s)

[have a strange](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m14s)

[suspicion uh width gets uh Source](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m15s)

[element actual width and Target element](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m21s)

[gets actual height I have a strange](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m24s)

[suspicion that's going to be a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m26s)

[requirement here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m28s)

[because setting the the background with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m30s)

[a brush doesn't actually change uh the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m33s)

[size of element it just says Hey as the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m36s)

[element gets bigger or smaller do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m38s)

[that that did nothing okay come](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m41s)

[here uh let's go here let's go here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m45s)

[let's just infect it okay well there it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m48s)

[is Target](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m50s)

[element and does it have a background](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m53s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m55s)

[set](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h14m57s)

[does have a visual brush but the visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m00s)

[brush appears to be El](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m02s)

[broken okay so what is going on here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m04s)

[what's different about what we did](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m08s)

[here not a lot not a lot because this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m11s)

[a framework element visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m14s)

[brush uh set](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m17s)

[caching](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m27s)

[did set the size of this element because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m29s)

[he is not we look at his actual height](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m32s)

[actual width he has a a size to go along](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m35s)

[with him which is nice it looks like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m39s)

[it's roughly in line with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m42s)

[this 132 204 and a bit 132 204 and a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m44s)

[little bit that sounds about right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m49s)

[looking multiple](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m52s)

[times okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h15m57s)

[so uh Let's do let's do the obvious](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m01s)

[thing ask the Googles uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m04s)

[WPF to brush I remember there's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m07s)

[something weird about this actually](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m09s)

[before we get too carried away the most](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m12s)

[logical explanation is delete everything](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m13s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m15s)

[suggested no offense co-pilot it's just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m21s)

[that I don't trust you see and co-pilot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m23s)

[that's why I don't trust you because see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m26s)

[that it worked now I also see something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m28s)

[weird because are those the same](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m31s)

[size are my eyes playing tricks on me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m36s)

[looks physically](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m40s)

[smaller yeah I think this is actually](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m47s)

[smaller 132](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m52s)

[204 13224](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h16m56s)

[four Noah no no no there's got to be a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m01s)

[padding or a margin or something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m05s)

[something me must [ __ ] with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m08s)

[this H not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m12s)

[that something seems a little](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m18s)

[off cu the rendering size of this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m21s)

[just a little bit off and you can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m24s)

[already see by doing the visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m27s)

[Rush uh box on the right definitely](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m28s)

[looks slightly smaller yeah agreed](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m31s)

[completely](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m33s)

[agreed like it's the the I'll say this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m35s)

[the Border whose background brush is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m38s)

[being set is reporting the same](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m40s)

[size but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m44s)

[yeah those are not the same](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m47s)

[size](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m54s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m57s)

[I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h17m59s)

[wonder Source element does have a margin](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m01s)

[set on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m04s)

[it let's do that real](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m07s)

[quick I I I wonder if there's something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m09s)

[weird going on here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m12s)

[what do we got going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m30s)

[on auto layout](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m31s)

[content so that's the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m39s)

[visual animated properties is seen](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m47s)

[relative transform this is what I was](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m50s)

[kind of hoping to abuse here the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m52s)

[transform that is applied to the brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m55s)

[using relative](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m57s)

[coordinates I don't think there'd be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h18m59s)

[anything weird set on the brush but we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m01s)

[can we can investigate the brush really](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m03s)

[quick and take a look let's dive let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m05s)

[let's go a little spelunking and see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m09s)

[why why might this guy have a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m12s)

[different so it it acknowledges the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m16s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m18s)

[great okay I want I want into the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m21s)

[brush uh how do I I don't want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m25s)

[want it dels thank you okay so alignment](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m28s)

[center uh these are all attached](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m37s)

[properties that are just being inherited](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m40s)

[in so none of those should be doing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m42s)

[anything there a option in these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m50s)

[things it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m54s)

[filters oh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h19m56s)

[oh this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m01s)

[cool I've never known you could do your](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m04s)

[own](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m06s)

[filter](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m07s)

[sets Okay then uh we're going to come](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m10s)

[back and play with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m13s)

[that because I've got quite a few that I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m15s)

[would like to do did not realize I could](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m17s)

[edit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m20s)

[these oh fun because of how it's set up](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m23s)

[you can't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m27s)

[can't click edit filters from once](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m28s)

[you've select it you got to click off](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m30s)

[and back on to get to edit filters](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m31s)

[interesting but if you want to see how](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m36s)

[to do uh filtering inside of uh Snoop](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m38s)

[there now an easy way of doing that okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m43s)

[continuing on I was hoping to find](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m46s)

[something that just filtered because the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m47s)

[the filters in Snoop](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m50s)

[are um pulling things in and I kind of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m52s)

[wanted something that would eliminate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h20m56s)

[uh attached properties so some of these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m00s)

[some of these I might be interested in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m03s)

[in render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m06s)

[mean](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m23s)

[okay actually](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m36s)

[okay looking for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m39s)

[something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m46s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m49s)

[stretch why okay riddle me this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m53s)

[why would setting stretch to fill make](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h21m58s)

[it smaller than setting stretch To](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m02s)

[None something something doesn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m08s)

[jive okay WPS visual brush stretch I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m12s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m15s)

[just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m17s)

[uh I want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m20s)

[understand says it's stretch property](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m24s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m27s)

[explain to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m28s)

[me is scal to fit the title tile because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m32s)

[the contents height and widths are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m37s)

[scaled](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m39s)

[independently might not be preserved](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m40s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m42s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m48s)

[interesting I I feel like I always want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m53s)

[none](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h22m56s)

[you see this this is the other fun thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m01s)

[you can do with visual brushes you'll](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m02s)

[not as this thing changes thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m03s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m06s)

[click um okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m08s)

[interesting so short version is if we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m12s)

[come in here and we change our](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m14s)

[stretch to none that will go a long way](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m17s)

[to making me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m20s)

[happy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m26s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m28s)

[so over here visual brush okay where I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m29s)

[kind of thought we were going to start](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m34s)

[rather than where we were going to have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m35s)

[to work our way into but you know what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m36s)

[close enough close enough okay so that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m38s)

[gets us to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m41s)

[there um both of you have the same sizes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m42s)

[everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m45s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m47s)

[okay oh that's funny when I uh it's even](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m51s)

[the visual brush is even picking up the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m55s)

[Ador ER that uh Snoop puts on it because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h23m57s)

[this red border is an adorner that Snoop](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m01s)

[adds to the elements to show you which](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m03s)

[item you have selected and the visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m04s)

[brush is even picking that up that's so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m06s)

[cool so cool okay so that gets me to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m07s)

[there that gets me to there now the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m10s)

[question is what can I do to the source](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m13s)

[element and still have the visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m16s)

[play nice so for example can I get away](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m19s)

[with doing uh MD card render trans form](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m22s)

[and do something like a rotate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m28s)

[transform uh angle of I don't know](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m30s)

[90° does](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m35s)

[that okay that that so it rotated the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m41s)

[control this one obviously didn't know](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m47s)

[to rotate so that one that one messed it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m49s)

[up um and if I do this with uh render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m52s)

[transform origin and we say rotate about](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m57s)

[the center rather](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h24m59s)

[than so if you don't set the render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m03s)

[transform origin your transforms are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m05s)

[applied from](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m07s)

[z0 where if you set the transform origin](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m11s)

[this is a um a point between zero and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m14s)

[one so people who remember their unit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m18s)

[circle from mathy classes uh so 0.5 0.5](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m22s)

[means halfway across on X halfway across](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m27s)

[on y there we get our way in now we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m29s)

[applying a 90° rotation starting at the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m33s)

[middle of our control rather than up in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m36s)

[the corner and Swinging it down so that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m37s)

[that applies](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m42s)

[there what happens if we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m45s)

[set opacity is zero I assume I know what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m50s)

[happens it goes away](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m56s)

[um I kind of want to just have you sit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h25m58s)

[on top where I don't have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m00s)

[to normally I would just put these on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m01s)

[separate screens but that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m04s)

[for you all who like to watch so uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m05s)

[we're going to just do topmost that way](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m08s)

[I can do it hey Izzy Merry Christmas](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m09s)

[Merry Christmas we are playing with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m13s)

[visual brushes um I I just wanted a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m15s)

[quick demo app where I can play around](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m19s)

[with some ideas that I had in terms of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m21s)

[trying to get a visual brush to render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m24s)

[the way that I want um because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m27s)

[ultimately on our on our flipper we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m30s)

[going to try to land this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m33s)

[thing close to close to where we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m35s)

[going um because at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m38s)

[we kind of want to snapshot this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m40s)

[and bring it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m43s)

[out okay so that doesn't get us quite](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m44s)

[where we want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m48s)

[to really hoping I could abused this a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m52s)

[little bit so can we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h26m55s)

[um can we place the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m03s)

[element because I'm trying to decide if](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m08s)

[there's a way for me to bring the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m10s)

[element visible without making it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m13s)

[visible](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m16s)

[and and have the I want to make the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m18s)

[visual brush behave in a way that it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m21s)

[not designed to behave because I want it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m22s)

[to paint without painting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m25s)

[um so if I come in here and do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m29s)

[new uh we'll just pick on rotate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m32s)

[transform and do another 45](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m35s)

[degrees I think what that gets](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m37s)

[me is a rotation that's now 90+](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m40s)

[00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,919](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m47s)

yeah which is not what I

[want but it's not as far off as one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m54s)

[might](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h27m57s)

[think not as far off as we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m02s)

[might okay so we can apply a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m10s)

[transform to it I probably don't want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m13s)

[to change it now in the material design](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m21s)

[library was it freezing that brush or](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m25s)

[not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m27s)

[making a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m35s)

[brush going through and setting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m41s)

[that um honestly I'm a little curious](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m45s)

[real quick to just go try something on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m48s)

[the plane 3D control I wonder if we can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m50s)

[fix part of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m53s)

[issue just with that change of the brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m55s)

[to set](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h28m58s)

[the um stretch if I do stretch stretch](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m00s)

[none do that and then we come](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m07s)

[down the other visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m11s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m14s)

[uh where is it thought I saw a second](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m16s)

[one well this one that's right the old](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m24s)

[one cheats a a little bit I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m26s)

[curious what this just by setting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m28s)

[stretch none on the old one I I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m30s)

[curious if that somewhat addresses a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m32s)

[little bit of the blurriness I don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m34s)

[anticipate it actually taking care](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m36s)

[of the the reacting to theme but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m40s)

[it a little bit of hope that there may](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m44s)

[be an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m46s)

[alternate solution so let's come down](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m47s)

[here still looks like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m52s)

[crap still looks like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m55s)

[crap be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h29m58s)

[clear yeah be clear](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m00s)

[unintended this side is not clear okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m04s)

[so the stretch doesn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m07s)

[actually get us around that and that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m10s)

[not too](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m13s)

[shocking not too terribly shocking to me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m16s)

[okay so on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m19s)

[our 3 new](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m24s)

[uh let's see here so we had both of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m30s)

[these why did I have a second visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m33s)

[brush on this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m35s)

[side right because I was starting and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m38s)

[ending with both and needed to build up](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m44s)

[a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m47s)

[visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m56s)

[uh so let's let's change these guys up](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h30m58s)

[to also have the same stretch Behavior](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m00s)

[because I I think none is very clearly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m02s)

[the obvious choice here we aren't trying](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m05s)

[to do anything fancy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m07s)

[and given that we were believe creating](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m12s)

[these every](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m15s)

[time uh because the content was hidden](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m17s)

[on keyframe zero so I had nothing to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m20s)

[render yes yes I believe that is a uh we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m22s)

[can confirm that but I believe last time](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m26s)

[that's exactly what we saw is if we get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m28s)

[rid of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m32s)

[the if we get rid of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m35s)

[visibility and have them both show up um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m38s)

[we can get it to behave](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m42s)

[properly um because if we come in here I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m46s)

[believe if we take Sno so just going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m49s)

[take Snoop and directly manipulate this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m51s)

[thing all right so we come in here and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m53s)

[we're going to grab the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m56s)

[the that guy's not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h31m59s)

[visible change the visibility on this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m02s)

[guy to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m05s)

[visible oh it's stupid storyboard is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m10s)

[overwriting me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m14s)

[um but on each of these presenters I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m16s)

[believe that was that was a bit of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m19s)

[problem the issue being and and this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m21s)

[what I was trying to see if we could](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m24s)

[solve is figuring out how to grab](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m25s)

[a a brush of an invisible](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m31s)

[item because that's kind of what I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m35s)

[looking to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m37s)

[do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m39s)

[is that kind of thing is adjust it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m41s)

[accordingly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m45s)

[now here is my other Theory uh of an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m46s)

[idea I want to do so if I scale](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m51s)

[transform this guy right so rather than](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m53s)

[rotation](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m56s)

[just scale it right so if you do scale X](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h32m57s)

[to scale Y 2 right twice as big right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m01s)

[what happens if we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m08s)

[this but I've Now functionally hidden](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m12s)

[the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m15s)

[guy but I am wondering if I can grab](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m18s)

[him and then visual brush him](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m23s)

[and reverse the the transform so this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m27s)

[kind of what I was hoping to do here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m30s)

[with this transform gets new scale](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m32s)

[transform and I I I want to try](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m36s)

[something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m39s)

[stupid right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m41s)

[of so if I have him](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m48s)

[tiny and I snapshot him and blow him up](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m52s)

[by a the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m55s)

[reverse no that doesn't quite](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h33m59s)

[work I was kind of hoping that something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m06s)

[like that could be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m09s)

[a interest that thing doesn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m18s)

[do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m25s)

[really so that hold on I'm confused why](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m28s)

[am I not getting anything out of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m31s)

[it I would have expected to at minimum](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m34s)

[get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m36s)

[the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m38s)

[okay but if okay so I get the small](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m44s)

[one but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m47s)

[why why does this not scale it up by a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m49s)

[factor of 100 or a factor of 100 to big](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m54s)

[now that the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h34m58s)

[problem well that that was one of my](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m02s)

[other thoughts is is just throw it all](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m04s)

[the way to the side and see what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m07s)

[happens I'm I'm surprised I'm getting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m10s)

[nothing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m12s)

[though like I I I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m13s)

[huh the transform to apply to the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m21s)

[brush default is the identity](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m24s)

[hey Z long time no](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m28s)

[see we're doing battle with our old](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m31s)

[friend The Flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m33s)

[control I think I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m35s)

[losing it's very likely that I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m38s)

[losing it's w that's interesting that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m44s)

[the if I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m46s)

[apply I must not be understanding how](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m51s)

[works because I would have assumed that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m52s)

[the VIS visual brush would](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m56s)

[render oh hold up what's this relative](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h35m58s)

[transform maybe I'm just using the wrong](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m06s)

[property hang on hang on hang on let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m09s)

[let's try](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m11s)

[that because IID assumed the visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m13s)

[brush would grab the the element at its](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m15s)

[shrunk down](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m18s)

[size the people actually use the flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m20s)

[I suspect no given the bugs that are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m22s)

[with it but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m25s)

[I'm kind of hoping that I can change](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m28s)

[that if I make it not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m29s)

[suck because I personally avoid using it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m31s)

[in a lot of cases unless all I'm doing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m34s)

[is like images or something I I don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m36s)

[like it for a lot of cases like it works](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m38s)

[fine if you're doing some sort of like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m40s)

[um just rendering pictures for example](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m43s)

[if you're doing a little card game for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m47s)

[example playing for that that that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m48s)

[works interesting okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m51s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m55s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h36m58s)

[bizarre okay so let's now now I'm just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m08s)

[now I'm just confused let's do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m11s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m14s)

[this okay so this guy has](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m17s)

[changed but we we might want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m21s)

[to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m23s)

[exactly that is that is interesting so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m25s)

[this thing at okay so if I scale it up](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m29s)

[twofold right this guy here and if we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m33s)

[look at his](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m35s)

[background he does have a visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m37s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m42s)

[um if it works it looks better I have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m47s)

[three haps to use it on yeah see that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m50s)

[that's the idea is I I would like it to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m51s)

[be function](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m55s)

[width](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m58s)

[height um so if I make the height double](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h37m59s)

[like uh what is that 260 something or](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m03s)

[another a little bit and the width I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m05s)

[don't know 405 410 something like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m09s)

[that oh clicking the button is going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m15s)

[shrink it down that didn't change I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m17s)

[curious how I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m21s)

[getting fact that I'm getting this kind](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m22s)

[of rendering on this me both hope and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m24s)

[fear that I don't know what I'm doing um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m27s)

[hope that my solution might be possible](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m30s)

[okay so let's let's try this let's do a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m33s)

[translate transform okay that was the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m37s)

[other the other possibility so if we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m39s)

[like x = minus](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m43s)

[50 right uh I think it stopped working a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m48s)

[while ago yeah it did and honestly I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m51s)

[don't know if it's ever been in a great](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m54s)

[State because the the underly 3D stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h38m56s)

[has been that way since I took over and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m00s)

[it there's been some minor fixes and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m03s)

[whatnot that have gone into it but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m05s)

[nothing major the underlying structure](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m07s)

[of it has existed the way it has for a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m10s)

[while okay so we're going to take this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m12s)

[off we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m14s)

[relaunch and grab this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m20s)

[guy ah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m25s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m30s)

[that's that's very](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m32s)

[interesting that is very interesting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m37s)

[so if I render transform it into the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m41s)

[middle of La La](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m44s)

[Land I might just be able to capture it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m51s)

[and here's the thing with the new](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m54s)

[structure this visual brush is only](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h39m57s)

[visible during the animation once the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m00s)

[animation completes the visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m03s)

[goes away and the actual you know WPF](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m05s)

[control with all of its native rendering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m08s)

[is going to be in its place so this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m10s)

[doesn't need to look perfect it just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m12s)

[needs to be close enough to fool the eye](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m15s)

[while the thing's in the middle of an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m17s)

[animation so it can be a little off and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m19s)

[be okay because I'm noticing there's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m22s)

[some subtle differences here along the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m24s)

[the drop shadow](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m27s)

[effect but okay okay okay I'm liking I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m29s)

[liking where this is going so I heard](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m33s)

[negative La La Land which in my case La](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m34s)

[La Land is negative](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m37s)

[10,000](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m40s)

[so nowhere clearly won't be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m42s)

[rendered actually you know what let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m45s)

[just make absolutely](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m47s)

[certain there that should be far enough](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m49s)

[that even with my two monitors three](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m52s)

[monitors no only two to the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m54s)

[left that's nowhere close to rendering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h40m58s)

[area](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m04s)

[oh okay okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m08s)

[so Theory](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m12s)

[Theory we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m15s)

[could okay so so let me I'm I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m19s)

[talk I'm going to talk this through and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m21s)

[then your job is to talk me out of a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m23s)

[crazy idea](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m25s)

[okay crazy idea crazy idea so here's our](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m26s)

[new](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m30s)

[one uh nope this is our old](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m31s)

[one uh still the old](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m35s)

[one this is the new one okay so if we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m38s)

[look at the new one the big difference](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m41s)

[with the new one is we've actually got](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m43s)

[uh two cards front and back content and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m46s)

[this is how we get the better rendering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m48s)

[is they are not contained within the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m50s)

[plane 3D they are siblings of the plane](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m52s)

[3D right so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m54s)

[when you click the plane 3D becomes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m56s)

[visible does the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h41m59s)

[animation it disappears leaves the the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m00s)

[actual card in place behind it poof as](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m03s)

[long as the the rendered visual brush is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m06s)

[pretty close the user might see a slight](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m09s)

[jump but that is by far better than what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m10s)

[we've got today in my opinion a a small](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m13s)

[potential glitch and I think we can get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m16s)

[it down to where it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m18s)

[imperceptible okay so when the flip](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m20s)

[occurs I'm thinking we take part front](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m23s)

[content part back content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m27s)

[apply uh a layout or no not a layout](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m31s)

[transform a render transform that's of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m34s)

[type translate transform we set it to ye](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m36s)

[off and La La Land so it goes for a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m39s)

[hike and then we grab the visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m44s)

[on that so we can make the control](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m47s)

[visible me see let me think that through](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m51s)

[we make the control visible](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m53s)

[and then we capture](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m56s)

[this and once we capture](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h42m59s)

[it then we should be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m03s)

[good yeah because I think that's what we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m09s)

[saw before is before we weren't able to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m12s)

[capture it because it wasn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m15s)

[visible and therefore wasn't working](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m19s)

[properly I think that makes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m23s)

[sense um let's change let's change this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m27s)

[up a little bit because we had uh this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m30s)

[guy here starting ending content blah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m34s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m36s)

[blah uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m38s)

[okay collapse up some of these here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m41s)

[so unflipped to flipped this is the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m45s)

[starting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m49s)

[Direction so before this was dealing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m50s)

[with toggling the visibility of the the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m53s)

[3D plane this is toggling the visibility](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h43m57s)

[here I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m05s)

[wondering do we have any guidelines from](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m07s)

[Google on this control that's a good](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m10s)

[question I I don't know if we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m11s)

[um this is one that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m16s)

[is this is one that is kind](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m25s)

[of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m28s)

[different um and I think it was probably](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m31s)

[brought in a little bit of feature Envy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m35s)

[of some other material](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m37s)

[design uh libraries because a lot of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m40s)

[controls](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m42s)

[aren't real](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m44s)

[specific um I think it would probably be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m46s)

[in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m49s)

[cards](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m51s)

[uh or is it under](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h44m54s)

[motion probably under](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m00s)

[motion yeah because they care more about](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m05s)

[their easing functions](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m07s)

[than than anything and I I think what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m10s)

[happened is this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m13s)

[was I I think this control came about by](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m19s)

[trying to implement one of these things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m22s)

[here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m25s)

[here screen forward](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m26s)

[back because I don't think flipper is an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m30s)

[actual control I think it flipper was an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m33s)

[implementation of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m36s)

[wanting to acquire](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m38s)

[something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m43s)

[exit short version I think the answer is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m51s)

[no](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m54s)

[like I said this thing has existed since](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m57s)

[long before I've been on but I have seen](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h45m59s)

[other material design libraries](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m01s)

[Implement similar type of animations now](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m03s)

[they may not have specific controls for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m07s)

[it but having that that kind of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m09s)

[concept I've seen um used](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m13s)

[before okay so we would like to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m16s)

[take so this guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m24s)

[here we don't want to go](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m28s)

[to uh no this is fine because this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m31s)

[going from front to back the difference](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m35s)

[is is we would like this thing to be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m38s)

[applied visibly at at times](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m39s)

[zero but we would also like to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m43s)

[apply and I think what we do here is we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m47s)

[just preemptively set](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m50s)

[the um the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m52s)

[transform because you can give these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m54s)

[guys names ahead of time so card and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h46m56s)

[we're going to do uh render oh I can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m00s)

[remember my examl render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m05s)

[transform we're going to do render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m09s)

[transform I guess we don't really need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m11s)

[to set an origin for this doesn't really](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m13s)

[matter uh let's see uh translate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m16s)

[transform and you'll see people](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m20s)

[oftentimes do a transform group and all](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m21s)

[of that stuff I don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m24s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m26s)

[Overkill okay so and then we can either](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m29s)

[reference it by going through this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m32s)

[property or we can reference it by name](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m34s)

[I think I'm just going to give it a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m36s)

[name that seems much easier because you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m38s)

[can technically go grab the part front](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m41s)

[content grab its render transform cast](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m43s)

[the value in render transform to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m46s)

[translate transform blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m47s)

[that's but I think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m49s)

[do is we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m51s)

[do here front](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m54s)

[content uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m57s)

[transform and then we're going to come](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h47m59s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m01s)

[to uh back](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m03s)

[content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m07s)

[transform okay so then up here what we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m09s)

[would like to do is we would like to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m13s)

[come over here and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m16s)

[say back content is becoming visible](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m19s)

[immediately but back content trans](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m23s)

[form uh and it's what is it translate X](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m26s)

[is what it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m30s)

[called The X oh no it's just X okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m34s)

[we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m40s)

[do may do X and Y long term but for now](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m41s)

[we're just going to do X to make my life](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m44s)

[not thinking](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m46s)

[hard um and we at so at Key times Z](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m47s)

[we're going to set this to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m51s)

[negative uh la la l](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m53s)

[land yeah negative 1 million I say that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h48m56s)

[should be good enough and then people](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m00s)

[are going to invent screens and have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m02s)

[monitors at coordinate resolutions that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m04s)

[are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m06s)

[insane but I guess it really doesn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m09s)

[matter as long as the coordinates are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m11s)

[big enough to get me outside the bounds](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m15s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m17s)

[window who's going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m19s)

[have you'd have because usually when you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m21s)

[run into window bounds problems it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m24s)

[because the windows maximized that would](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m26s)

[require a monitor with a resolution of 1](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m28s)

[million pixels this thing to be all the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m32s)

[way on the yeah it's not possible we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m34s)

[going to say not possible okay and then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m37s)

[we're going to go here and at keytime 4](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m39s)

[he's going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m42s)

[magically whoop just jump right right to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m44s)

[zero so he's going to go from middle of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m47s)

[nowhere to back onsite no thinking okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m49s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m56s)

[guy doesn't need to move](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h49m57s)

[anywhere I don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m00s)

[think he might he might actually so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m03s)

[let's leave](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m07s)

[him let's leave him as he exists we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m09s)

[going to get rid of the hidden but let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m12s)

[bring in one of these guys here for him](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m14s)

[as](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m17s)

[well separate these up so I can keep](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m18s)

[track of what I'm doing so this is going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m20s)

[to be the front content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m21s)

[transform and so he is going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m24s)

[to immediately jump to negative 1](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m28s)

[million as well because I don't need him](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m31s)

[around I just want him gone as well](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m34s)

[because the plane 3D is the one that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m36s)

[like the whole point is he's the one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m39s)

[becoming visible to take](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m41s)

[over um so sending both of them to La La](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m43s)

[Land sounds](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m47s)

[great and then at the end of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m49s)

[animation he can come back to zero but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m52s)

[he's going to come back collect so it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m54s)

[whatever okay now I think we replicate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h50m58s)

[this Behavior Down Below on the other](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m02s)

[flip](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m05s)

[Direction uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m07s)

[here so we're going to collapse these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m13s)

[because I don't want to think about](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m16s)

[these too much okay so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m16s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m19s)

[one so this is the guy that we we need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m21s)

[to invert right so he's going to go here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m24s)

[once again during the animation both the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m27s)

[content gets sent to la la land area and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m31s)

[then I think the translate the the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m39s)

[animations this gets easy right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m42s)

[because we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m46s)

[don't we don't hide or collapse either](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m48s)

[of the controls during the animation](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m51s)

[like what we were doing before we were](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m53s)

[doing hidden or collapse instead we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m55s)

[translate them out of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h51m57s)

[here yeah yeah let's let's try it what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m00s)

[could go wrong what could go wrong what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m05s)

[could](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m07s)

[go](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m24s)

[okay we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m34s)

[this that's not a good](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m37s)

[sign is it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m40s)

[doing cannot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m46s)

[animate oh because it's an object](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m51s)

[animation okay woo woo](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m53s)

[okay a little confused there for a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m55s)

[second okay hold on hold on it's because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m57s)

[I'm an idiot because I'm an idiot don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h52m59s)

[worry](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m01s)

[uh the X property is a double not an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m03s)

[object so we want double animation using](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m06s)

[frames](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m10s)

[uh and I I don't remember what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m12s)

[the yeah it's it's very picky about](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m16s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m24s)

[is it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m33s)

[the double key](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m39s)

[frames](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m42s)

[uh move window origin yeah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m46s)

[see I mean we joke but I may actually](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m51s)

[declare a constant so that that negative](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m54s)

[1 million can be can have a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h53m57s)

[name actually just yesterday I was doing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m00s)

[a code review for a colleague and a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m02s)

[sizable percentage of the comments that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m05s)

[I left on the pr was hey can we give can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m06s)

[we give these magical values some names](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m10s)

[because there is like and it I I left a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m13s)

[comment on there I'm like I don't care](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m16s)

[if it's a code comment or if we declare](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m17s)

[a constant and give it a name I was like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m19s)

[at the end of the day when I'm reading](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m21s)

[this code and I see a magical number](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m22s)

[sitting there I'd like to have some idea](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m24s)

[of like where it came](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m26s)

[from at at something which it wasn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m29s)

[like it was a a big discussion I did the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m31s)

[code review and it was like oh yeah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m34s)

[definitely of course like that was just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m36s)

[kind of an oversight while I was doing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m37s)

[it okay I cannot find the right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m38s)

[type um double key frame collection oh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m42s)

[it's just double key frame](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m46s)

[okay uh and then oh actually we can just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m50s)

[do have a feeling that will just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m53s)

[work what are you squawking](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h54m59s)

[about not be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m01s)

[added double key frame collection does](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m04s)

[not accept values of key frames](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m07s)

[uh G to disagree with that one pretty uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m10s)

[vehemently in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m14s)

[fact pretty pretty confident here that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m22s)

[this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m24s)

[uh takes double key frame](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m26s)

[okay I'm feeling I'm feeling dumb and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m30s)

[I'm feeling lazy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m32s)

[um let's call it la la la and x and make](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m36s)

[it in Min that's actually not a bad idea](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m39s)

[that should be uh far enough outside the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m43s)

[range of what's reasonably possible like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m46s)

[it's one of those if anybody actually](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m49s)

[gets to there like I don't know what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m51s)

[they are expecting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h55m59s)

[oh got it it's because double key frame](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m00s)

[is an abstract base got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m04s)

[got it got it okay so don't be an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m06s)

[idiot we'll just do discreet because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m09s)

[that's all we care about right okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m12s)

[this guy comes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m15s)

[here and we're going to do this and then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m17s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m22s)

[comes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m23s)

[and the one above as](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m35s)

[well actually we're just going to go](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m38s)

[bing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m41s)

[then that out of here uh let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m49s)

[see uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m53s)

[double animation that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h56m55s)

[one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m00s)

[there](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m02s)

[okay a lot of work for something very](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m03s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m17s)

[uh okay Moment of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m23s)

[Truth](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m28s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m30s)

[yes okay that didn't work that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m35s)

[okay one of them worked I probably have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m39s)

[something backwards that's okay that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m42s)

[means it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m45s)

[possible oh yeah I do have something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m50s)

[backwards cuz I can see during in the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m53s)

[animation it's doing something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m55s)

[weird doing something very weird okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m57s)

[here's what we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h57m59s)

[do oh oh I am so happy right now so so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m00s)

[happy booah that means this flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m06s)

[control doesn't have to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m09s)

[suck um so happy okay screen to GIF if](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m12s)

[people haven't seen this tool like okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m17s)

[let me so so Pro tip uh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m22s)

[here uh wi get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m25s)

[search uh screen to GIF hang on if](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m29s)

[anybody if like this is this is an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m34s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m36s)

[Tool](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m37s)

[uh it's it's it's out there hang on I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m40s)

[think it's I think it's not two I think](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m43s)

[it's yeah this guy here so if anybody](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m47s)

[wants it it is wind get in install that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m51s)

[magical ID you're Off to the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h58m56s)

[Races and also the the developer builds](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m02s)

[this if you love it Go support him like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m06s)

[he's awesome this is a wonderful tool](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m08s)

[okay so we're going to debug](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m11s)

[this by just screen recording this we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m13s)

[going to see how this works and we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m16s)

[GNA go](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m18s)

[whoop whoop stop okay and we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m20s)

[grab the little editor and I want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m25s)

[just look at what happens here when I do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m26s)

[this okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m31s)

[so so the so there's the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m33s)

[click okay there's the click and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m38s)

[sometime between there and there both](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m40s)

[controls go to La La](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m42s)

[Land and we will note that something's a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m44s)

[little off and that our our content here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m47s)

[appears to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m51s)

[be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m53s)

[we got a size jump here that's going on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m55s)

[that I'm not sure I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=00h59m57s)

[like and it's I I suspect the size jump](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m02s)

[is related to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m05s)

[the the The Flipper control itself is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m07s)

[increasing in size to account for the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m11s)

[the bigger control that's coming so I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m15s)

[think what's happening is as soon as we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m17s)

[make that uh this green edit thing uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m20s)

[visible it's increasing the size of our](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m25s)

[flipper bloating the size of this and I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m27s)

[think what we may want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m31s)

[do I think we want to change the timing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m33s)

[of this so that he doesn't become](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m36s)

[visible until halfway through if we can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m38s)

[help it if we can help it because it'd](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m41s)

[be nice if right as that animation gets](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m43s)

[vertical if that's when we do the split](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m47s)

[me try that okay so there's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m50s)

[that and you know this thing's just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m53s)

[snapshotting so it's not it's not a like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m56s)

[if we play this guy back like you can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h00m58s)

[tell this is not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m02s)

[a it's definitely dropping](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m03s)

[frames like this is not a it's not a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m06s)

[clean animation but good enough for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m08s)

[debugging purposes because it shows me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m11s)

[exactly what's going on okay so that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m12s)

[shows there and then I'm also noting on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m15s)

[the back side of this flip I'm I'm now](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m17s)

[once again seeing this resize so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m20s)

[something's off there because I should](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m22s)

[be seeing the other control at this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m25s)

[point we want it to change to that one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m27s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m30s)

[wrong and then we get to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m32s)

[there so something's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m35s)

[backwards and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m37s)

[then we have this guy here and then when](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m40s)

[we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m43s)

[click so as soon as we click boom and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m45s)

[then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m48s)

[gone and then everything and then we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m50s)

[back to the beginning](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m53s)

[okay so something's backwards](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m55s)

[something's backwards first of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h01m57s)

[all a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m01s)

[working save point working idea I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m03s)

[realized my My Big Fat Head's in the way](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m06s)

[I'll move this over there people can see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m07s)

[this right a working idea so we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m09s)

[gonna commit that that real quick just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m13s)

[just so that just so that it's there](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m16s)

[we've got a working idea now how to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m17s)

[figure out how to fix](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m20s)

[it okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m22s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m27s)

[bring okay so this is the unflip to flip](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m34s)

[so this should be the first](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m37s)

[animation okay and I think we're happy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m39s)

[with when the plane 3D comes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m42s)

[visible I don't think I care about this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m47s)

[as much](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m52s)

[yeah we had tried to do this binding](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m57s)

[thing for it last time and that that has](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h02m59s)

[proved to not be overly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m01s)

[relevant so I think we ignore that for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m04s)

[the moment we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m06s)

[have visibility being set and then the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m09s)

[rotation as it animates](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m12s)

[through because we have to do the 9090](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m15s)

[flip which is fine like it occurs so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m17s)

[fast nobody sees it okay now down](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m21s)

[here the back content so the The](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m26s)

[Disappearing and coming back this much](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m29s)

[works](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m32s)

[great I'm wondering what happens if](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m35s)

[I I make this a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m40s)

[two I'm wondering I'm wondering if this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m45s)

[works because I'm I'm partially scared](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m49s)

[that I'm going to get bit halfway](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m52s)

[through to the animation because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m54s)

[it it's cached something so there is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h03m56s)

[that that that part mildly concerns me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m00s)

[but we'll see how that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m03s)

[goes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m05s)

[um this one doesn't really](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m10s)

[matter but I think we can do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m16s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m23s)

[and I'm curious what happens here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m25s)

[because we have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m27s)

[now because I think we might have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m30s)

[something backwards in our 3D code as](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m32s)

[well because and this is starting and it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m35s)

[um I think we need to not call this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m40s)

[starting and ending we need to call this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m41s)

[unflipped and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m43s)

[flipped probably do a rename](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m46s)

[here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m53s)

[see how that goes we we should probably](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m56s)

[rename those to to flipped and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h04m57s)

[unflipped um I though I realized the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m01s)

[plane 3D is whatever it's it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m03s)

[technically the fact that this is being](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m06s)

[used as a flipper this thing is kind of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m07s)

[an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m09s)

[arbitrary animation plane that like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m10s)

[inside of uh your app today you can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m13s)

[actually leverage this the the plane 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m16s)

[control slap your own controls inside of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m19s)

[it and start applying these these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m21s)

[properties the fact that we're using it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m23s)

[for a flipper is kind of arbitrary so I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m25s)

[don't know what you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m27s)

[call](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m29s)

[this and maybe that's part of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m32s)

[issue maybe that's part of the issue you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m37s)

[swap them at any point we don't and I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m40s)

[wondering if if maybe that's what I've](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m42s)

[done wrong in in all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m44s)

[because I I poached This Plane 3D thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m47s)

[so the old one worked around the idea of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m51s)

[you would set the the children of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m55s)

[plane 3D and it and once you set the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h05m58s)

[child in zaml it would go through and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m01s)

[remove the child from the visual tree do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m04s)

[all this brush stuff kind of fake it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m06s)

[being there with adding visual children](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m08s)

[and doing measurements and all that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m10s)

[stuff so it it was doing wacky wacky](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m12s)

[stuff um but all of that was basically](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m15s)

[working um because of this right right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m21s)

[because plane 3D was a parent of these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m24s)

[two content controls so the the actual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m27s)

[swapping between the content controls](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m29s)

[was occurring by showing and hiding](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m32s)

[these content presenters and then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m35s)

[relying on the visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m36s)

[brush um to to update accordingly um the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m38s)

[problem is is this whole grid is now put](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m43s)

[inside of a visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m46s)

[brush is functionally why we have issues](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m48s)

[with the rendering text looking like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m51s)

[garbage and why it doesn't respond to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m53s)

[theming changes is why I didn't want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m55s)

[put them inside of it I want these](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h06m58s)

[things to be siblings and I want to feed](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m01s)

[a reference to them in so that we can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m04s)

[visual brush them](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m07s)

[in unflipped and flipped should use](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m10s)

[opposite controls](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m13s)

[agreed agreed but that's where I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m17s)

[thinking I I'm wondering if this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m19s)

[actually needs both](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m21s)

[or if a much better API is for this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m24s)

[thing to just have a single control and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m26s)

[US swap out what it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m28s)

[the like I'm wondering if rather than](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m32s)

[two properties if what this thing really](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m34s)

[should just be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m36s)

[is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m38s)

[um like plain](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m40s)

[content because really what this guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m43s)

[does is he has a 3D AIS similar to how](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m45s)

[Snoop is able](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m49s)

[to um do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m52s)

[maneuver right because Snoop](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h07m56s)

[has uh I go 3D Snoop has the window as a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m00s)

[a single element on its 3D plane that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m07s)

[you can then rotate around and look at](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m09s)

[and I'm wondering if that's if that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m12s)

[really what we should do is we should](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m14s)

[have the plane 3D control exist but have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m16s)

[it only taken a single element because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m19s)

[right now it's starting to be hardcoded](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m22s)

[do the flipper and I I'd like to think](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m23s)

[about it other](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m25s)

[ones uh private framework content for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m26s)

[currently visible](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m29s)

[one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m33s)

[um the current one I don't think is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m34s)

[private I assume that's what you're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m37s)

[referring to the current plane plane](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m38s)

[3D it's currently public in the library](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m41s)

[it's just it's difficult to use and I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m44s)

[don't anticipate people actually using](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m46s)

[it um it's largely been there to support](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m48s)

[it but and it's based upon the best](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m52s)

[technology that 2007 had to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m55s)

[offer but I am I am proposing scrapping](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h08m58s)

[it in favor](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m01s)

[of this new one but I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m03s)

[that this guy shouldn't have starting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m08s)

[and ending content he should just have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m10s)

[content and I'm thinking that's probably](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m17s)

[better](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m22s)

[is let him have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m24s)

[both things and then rotate around](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m27s)

[them I think that's I I think that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m31s)

[probably better because we don't need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m34s)

[any of this stuff anymore that makes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m35s)

[this a whole heck of a lot easier](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m37s)

[because now we get down to this idea](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m39s)

[of I don't need to do a lot of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m43s)

[this because I only need this one bit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m49s)

[okay so let's let's try that let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m55s)

[try functionally axing ending](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h09m58s)

[content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m03s)

[um I think we're going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m09s)

[this we're going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m14s)

[this means this doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m18s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m22s)

[this doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m27s)

[exist this doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m34s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m41s)

[means](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m43s)

[uh consisting of the backside and two](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m45s)

[lights I don't think we need this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m48s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m52s)

[and then I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m55s)

[think don't need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h10m57s)

[that I think this is all we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m01s)

[need I'm not even confident we need that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m05s)

[anymore we do need that still](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m07s)

[okay and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m10s)

[then as a test what we are going to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m13s)

[is we are going to unregister this and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m15s)

[we are going to swap out the starting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m19s)

[content property](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m22s)

[halfway through the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m24s)

[animation yeah I think I like this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m29s)

[mildly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m33s)

[better so this is going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m36s)

[be basically](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m39s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m47s)

[that don't know why Visual Studio isn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m49s)

[updating figur it out Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m51s)

[um but we want to go here so actually at](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h11m56s)

[zero we would like starting content to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m01s)

[be set to the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m04s)

[front uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m06s)

[at](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m10s)

[two we would like to change it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m12s)

[to uh ending](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m17s)

[content or back content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m20s)

[and then at four we can go to null again](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m24s)

[that's perfectly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m26s)

[fine we want this and then we want to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m29s)

[the opposite order on the other uh going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m33s)

[the other direction on the other](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m37s)

[direction we basically want to do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m39s)

[and make this a zero and this a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m43s)

[two and then I want to check what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m49s)

[trigger triggers when we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m53s)

[the this guy's property](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m56s)

[change I want to make sure he calling](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h12m59s)

[update](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m03s)

[rotation validate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m07s)

[measure I don't know when this is going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m11s)

[to get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m13s)

[reinvoke we're gonna I don't know how](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m16s)

[often this is going to fire](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m20s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m22s)

[oh it does fire on starting content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m27s)

[property change so it should fire for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m31s)

[each](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m33s)

[chain okay okay we might be okay we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m34s)

[might be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m36s)

[okay might be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m38s)

[okay okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m40s)

[test immediate crash excellent I was](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m43s)

[worried this would be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m45s)

[easy um the update](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m47s)

[3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m52s)

[this isn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m54s)

[check uh starting content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h13m57s)

[is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m01s)

[content I think we're going to rename](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m03s)

[that thing down](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m05s)

[anyway that'll that'll do the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m13s)

[bounds I I I think this is going to get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m19s)

[closer I think we're going to be very](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m22s)

[very close](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m24s)

[here so that didn't quite do what I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m36s)

[expected at least in terms](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m41s)

[of rendering this properly because now](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m45s)

[we're in a we're in a worse State than](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m48s)

[we were](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m50s)

[before I am thinking that I would like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m52s)

[to test this control a little bit more](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h14m56s)

[in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m00s)

[isolation](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m03s)

[so let's let's do this let's spend a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m09s)

[mild amount of time giving us a better a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m11s)

[better](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m14s)

[testout that's I think that's what I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m16s)

[want to do give](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m18s)

[myself a test page to play in that's a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m21s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m24s)

[nicer nicer area Okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m26s)

[so JY morning how we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m30s)

[doing we are once again making progress](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m33s)

[on our flippy floppy control and it is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m36s)

[working we have a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m39s)

[solution that we at](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m41s)

[puzzled puzzled by me or puzzled by](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m49s)

[something else uh let's see see uh 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m51s)

[test I I don't know what to call it and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m55s)

[I'm right now I'm too lazy to think of a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m57s)

[good name um and then I just want to add](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h15m59s)

[it into](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m02s)

[my list of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m03s)

[pages uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m07s)

[here generate demo items](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m12s)

[yeah uh web browser in a draw poost is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m15s)

[showing when hidden](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m18s)

[ah uh where](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m21s)

[are you using the builtin WPF web](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m23s)

[browser or is this like web view 2 I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m26s)

[don't know if it's going to matter but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m29s)

[you are likely bumping into the WPF](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m31s)

[airspace](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m33s)

[issue](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m36s)

[um okay so the WPF one so there is there](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m38s)

[is a fundamental problem with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m43s)

[um controls that have their own window](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m48s)

[host](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m52s)

[um and so what is what is likely](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m55s)

[occurring so inside the the drawer host](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h16m58s)

[there's the the the animation bits but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m01s)

[it does I believe before I put my foot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m03s)

[all the way in my](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m06s)

[mouth if only I knew where to find the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m07s)

[uh animation control for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m10s)

[this have it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m18s)

[generic might have it just in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m21s)

[generic default where is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m25s)

[it um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m28s)

[host let's see there's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m42s)

[Ripple](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m45s)

[line all Direction](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m47s)

[indicator color Zone your host](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m50s)

[uh does that does that do this that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h17m56s)

[acity oh it could be the opacity going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m03s)

[to zero so inside of WPF there's a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m06s)

[handful of things that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m08s)

[um are optimized to not render controls](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m11s)

[visibility opacity and I think the size](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m15s)

[going to zero are some of the common](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m18s)

[cases where a control won the the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m21s)

[rendering won't spend any time rendering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m23s)

[it the problem being is the the web](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m25s)

[browser control and oftentimes people](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m28s)

[will get this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m31s)

[um with it used to be a bigger problem](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m33s)

[with like direct X controls when people](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m35s)

[would put them directly in WPF is they](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m37s)

[don't participate in the WPF rendering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m40s)

[and so they are rendered on top of all](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m44s)

[of your](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m46s)

[zaml which is what people will](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m47s)

[affectionately refer to as the airspace](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m49s)

[issue functionally they right on top I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m51s)

[the airspace above it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h18m55s)

[um there is a handful](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m00s)

[of yeah so you'll](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m04s)

[see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m10s)

[um yeah the this guy here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m14s)

[is basically the exact uh problem s um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m19s)

[and it's not limited to just browser uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m25s)

[it's a it's a common issue so I suspect](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m28s)

[inside of the drawer host what you are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m31s)

[probably seeing is it showing up for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m33s)

[0.56 seconds give or take a little bit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m36s)

[so when you say just for a second I'm](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m39s)

[going to go with just a little more than](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m41s)

[half a second is my would be my working](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m43s)

[theory that you see it show up but then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m46s)

[once the opacity gets all the way to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m48s)

[zero uh for being hidden or shown uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m51s)

[yeah 0.56 seems right I'm willing to bet](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m54s)

[that's what's happening is during the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m57s)

[animation there's not a way because it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h19m59s)

[not participating in the the rendering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m01s)

[engine WPF is only considering do I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m04s)

[render this thing at all or not and so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m07s)

[during the animation it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m10s)

[visible right up until it goes through](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m12s)

[what you what you may want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m15s)

[do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m17s)

[is uh delay show or hide it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m19s)

[um assuming it's possible so there are a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m24s)

[couple common workarounds for the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m28s)

[airspace that I've seen people do one is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m30s)

[not actually too uncommon of this visual](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m32s)

[brush trick is if you can tie into the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m35s)

[appropriate events in your UI to know](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m38s)

[when to show and hide](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m40s)

[it at the point you want to render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m41s)

[something on top of it you visual brush](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m44s)

[it then render the thing on top and then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m46s)

[when the thing goes away you bring it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m49s)

[back and basically SW swap it in and out](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m50s)

[which is it's not great right and it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m53s)

[becomes really obvious if your web](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m56s)

[browser is showing something that's like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m57s)

[animated or similar um because it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h20m59s)

[really bloody obvious once you've](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m02s)

[snapshotted it that that's what's going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m03s)

[on um but the drawer host does have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m05s)

[events that you can tie into for knowing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m08s)

[when drawers are opening and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m11s)

[closing um so that may](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m14s)

[be something you could](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m17s)

[do in terms of being able to uh show or](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m19s)

[hide](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m24s)

[it but it it is kind of obnoxious the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m25s)

[other thing that you'll see pop up a lot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m28s)

[that people will reference with airspace](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m30s)

[is Dwayne](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m32s)

[need](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m37s)

[uh it might be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m40s)

[it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m44s)

[yeah this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m47s)

[is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m51s)

[this is mitigating it at an advanced](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m53s)

[level let's put it this way](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h21m56s)

[um this is actually not too far unlike](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m00s)

[the the dirty trick that we're doing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m04s)

[with the visual brush of sending the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m05s)

[thing to La La](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m07s)

[Land](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m08s)

[um but this is functionally taking the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m11s)

[window moving it off screen and then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m14s)

[forwarding the rendering back](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m16s)

[onto um a WPF layer so that it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m18s)

[participates properly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m21s)

[yeah and yeah abusing the layered](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m25s)

[windows so if you want to if you want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m27s)

[do all of this I will warn you I have](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m29s)

[used this on apps in the past um if CPU](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m31s)

[and performance are at all a limiting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m36s)

[factor for you use this sparingly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m38s)

[because it does put a little bit extra](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m41s)

[load](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m44s)

[um on on your rendering and I think he](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m47s)

[calls that out in some of his render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m50s)

[thread considerations](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m51s)

[so don't just blindly slap this thing in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m53s)

[in everywhere it should be used in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m56s)

[intentionally like most things um but I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h22m59s)

[think those are the common ways I've](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m02s)

[seen people do it the other way I've](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m05s)

[seen people do it is design around it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m06s)

[like I was building an app where I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m09s)

[needed to pop the web browser um and the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m11s)

[other thing hang on let show one more](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m14s)

[thing or thing while I'm while I'm here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m16s)

[uh you will probably run into to issues](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m20s)

[with the the rendering of some stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m23s)

[with the built-in control like it's not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m26s)

[bad and it gets better depending on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m29s)

[which version of Windows you're deployed](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m30s)

[onto um if you can web view 2 is a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m32s)

[much much nicer browser control to play](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m37s)

[with um it doesn't come with any of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m40s)

[old IE garbage stuff along with it um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m45s)

[that you can sometimes pick up in WPF](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m48s)

[apps especially if you're targeting like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m51s)

[framework or whatnot this is a much more](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m52s)

[modern browser](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m55s)

[control so if you are if you able to and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h23m56s)

[it and it is uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m01s)

[reasonable](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m03s)

[um all a preview channel of Microsoft](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m05s)

[Edge](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m08s)

[no step two cannot be a requirement](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m10s)

[because I'm using it in an app and I do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m13s)

[not have this um I think the key part](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m14s)

[here is the minimum required version of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m17s)

[edge I think we are well past this uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m20s)

[where is my](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m25s)

[about uh](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m30s)

[help uh that's not useful I want to I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m36s)

[want to see what version I'm on I think](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m39s)

[I think we are well past](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m41s)

[this without](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m44s)

[Microsoft yeah so I am currently on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m47s)

[version 120 blah blah blah so the key](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m49s)

[thing here is in order to leverage it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m53s)

[you have to be on a version of edge that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m55s)

[is this or](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m57s)

[greater um which I think is G most](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h24m59s)

[people if they are at all updating their](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m04s)

[Windows like this may have been an issue](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m06s)

[several years ago when this came out I I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m08s)

[imagine it's going to be real hard to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m11s)

[find a user that has too old of a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m13s)

[version](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m16s)

[here so but again doesn't solve the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m17s)

[airspace issue but it does give you a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m20s)

[nicer browser so you get a a web](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m22s)

[interaction that doesn't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m27s)

[suck yeah no problem um glad to try to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m30s)

[shed light on on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m34s)

[confusion uh let's see so we were](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m37s)

[building this guy real quick so we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m39s)

[going to call](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m42s)

[it uh that's not how you spell 3D 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m43s)

[test uh I don't care about any of this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m46s)

[stuff honestly I don't care about any of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m50s)

[looking](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h25m56s)

[going to do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h28m48s)

[and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h28m51s)

[leverage that and then this guy let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h28m54s)

[see do we put the preview on the left](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h28m58s)

[and the controls on the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m00s)

[right a sure fine we'll do that um and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m02s)

[we're going to turn visibility on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m06s)

[because that would be dumb to turn it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m07s)

[off and then on the right we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m09s)

[do I don't know stack panel sounds great](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m11s)

[grid column](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m14s)

[one right and we'll just do vertical](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m16s)

[alignment center and we're just going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m19s)

[load some stuff up so I am looking for a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m20s)

[slider I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m24s)

[guess uh minimum is going to be I think](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m25s)

[zero and no minimum I want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m30s)

[be90](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m36s)

[maximum uh I want to be 90 because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m39s)

[that's kind of again I just I want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m42s)

[play with being able to move this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m44s)

[around and I would like to bind its](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m46s)

[current](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m48s)

[value binding to element name uh part](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m50s)

[plane 3D and we are going to do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m54s)

[rotation](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h29m59s)

[why um actually we should probably do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m02s)

[this in the opposite direction probably](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m04s)

[better to go here and then do uh X](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m07s)

[name](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m14s)

[uh so you spell rotation with an R last](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m18s)

[I checked rotation starts with an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m22s)

[R um then we're going to bind this guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m26s)

[to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m29s)

[Value okay um yeah I think that's better](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m35s)

[and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m40s)

[then iy buy tway by](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m43s)

[default I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m46s)

[matters CU we're we're really only going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m49s)

[to be as this guy changes going back and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m51s)

[forth okay and then we need to give this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m54s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m56s)

[a a thingy play with for his content um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h30m58s)

[let's grab just for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m03s)

[fun go to that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m05s)

[flipper it's on the cards page we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m08s)

[just going to grab the same](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m11s)

[control](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m15s)

[um uh new](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m19s)

[I just want to grab this little bit of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m23s)

[content yeah we're going to grab this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m30s)

[bring this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m34s)

[over and we are going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m35s)

[do do a stack panel](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m40s)

[here we are going to move this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m45s)

[down](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m50s)

[we're going to paste this here so we're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m52s)

[going to have the real content here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m53s)

[alongside](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h31m56s)

[the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m04s)

[um I should probably rename this to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m07s)

[material design rather than WPF to make](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m10s)

[it match the rest of the demo out then](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m11s)

[it's only a rename in one place okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m14s)

[this is going to go](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m16s)

[here uh let's see we're going to do name](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m17s)

[uh uh flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m21s)

[content and this guy's starting content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m24s)

[is going to be flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m27s)

[content now we're just going to format](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m28s)

[that so I don't have to think too](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m31s)

[hard so we will have this guy in two](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m36s)

[places top and bottom we will have a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m39s)

[slider that lets us rotate his thing and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m41s)

[then we can play with this see how it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m45s)

[goes uh yeah so let's change](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m48s)

[our startup](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m54s)

[thing to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m56s)

[be uh rather than cards we'll do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h32m58s)

[3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m02s)

[test](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m03s)

[go just to save a mild amount of time](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m05s)

[when we're launching the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m08s)

[app that way we can start to play around](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m09s)

[with just the plain 3D control outside](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m12s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m14s)

[flipper and get it working properly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m15s)

[apparently that did not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m18s)

[work](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m20s)

[okay so that did not do what I expected](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m25s)

[uh most notably did not render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m29s)

[anything so let's just see I assume this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m31s)

[is the real one and the other one](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m34s)

[is uh lost to the wind flipper content](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m37s)

[there there is the plane 3D it has a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m41s)

[height of zero and a width of 51 that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m44s)

[a it's a great start um being completely](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m47s)

[and utterly uh useless so awesome uh the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m52s)

[content is appropriately](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h33m58s)

[bound okay I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m02s)

[start then is rotation](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m06s)

[y changing as I drag](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m09s)

[this like it should be doing what I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m17s)

[want um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m19s)

[okay what have I what have I messed up](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m22s)

[in my setup](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m24s)

[here okay rotation y starting content Z](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m26s)

[Factor that's all](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m30s)

[good](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m33s)

[uh let's try something like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m35s)

[height](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m38s)

[01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:53,040](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m44s)

uh about width uh

[two](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m50s)

[it greatly concerns me that this guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m53s)

[didn't get immediately booted down](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m54s)

[considering they're inside of a stack](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m57s)

[panel we're going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h34m58s)

[relaunch oh oh oh oh I accidentally](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m12s)

[clicked on the email button and it CI my](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m15s)

[mail client that is not what we want](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m18s)

[okay um okay so that's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m20s)

[better](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m27s)

[okay I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m34s)

[mean yes and at the same time very much](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m36s)

[no but I am noticing that this thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m41s)

[here was anticipating being inside of a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m43s)

[card and it's no longer inside of a card](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m45s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m50s)

[let's do that real](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m52s)

[quick the previous one was anticipating](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m55s)

[being wrapped in a card inside of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h35m58s)

[flipper and now this one is no longer](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m00s)

[some of this rendering looking weird is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m03s)

[because of that we'll move the flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m05s)

[content up to the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m08s)

[card that will and then we'll just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m10s)

[format all that stuff because I'm too](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m12s)

[lazy to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m14s)

[think and let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m15s)

[relaunch](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m20s)

[and I'm I'm curious why I lost](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m22s)

[color like that usually that's an](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m27s)

[indication](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m30s)

[of of a brush not being](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m34s)

[found](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m42s)

[that's and this is kind like this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m43s)

[kind of giving me what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m46s)

[right is I want it to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m47s)

[go right CU secretly what's happening is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m50s)

[we go this way we jump over to here and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m52s)

[then we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m55s)

[go boom that way it looks like it looks](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h36m57s)

[like a full flip but secretly it's not a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m01s)

[full flip half flip got](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m04s)

[twice um okay so let's fix this guy here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m07s)

[uh horizontal alignment](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m12s)

[center](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m20s)

[okay I'm increasingly not trusting hot](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m24s)

[reload uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m29s)

[card make sure that yeah horizontal](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m32s)

[alignment](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m35s)

[center that's going to get us to where](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m37s)

[we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m39s)

[want that did properly update but it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m43s)

[not finding the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m46s)

[brushes and it's not sized properly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m47s)

[something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m52s)

[is something is very very wrong](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m53s)

[here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h37m57s)

[um if I take this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m01s)

[away I assume it's just going to size to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m04s)

[zero again and we're going to lose](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m06s)

[it at least I assume that's what's going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m11s)

[to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m14s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m20s)

[yeah it's size to zero and we lose it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m22s)

[that's not helpful um let's invert the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m25s)

[order of these guys first of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m27s)

[all and then we're going to move you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m31s)

[down to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m33s)

[here probably not helping anything that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m34s)

[a stack panel wants to collapse its](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m37s)

[content down as small as small as](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m40s)

[possible um I am going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m42s)

[to I'm going to just do this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m46s)

[uh with wi is going to be uh binding](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m49s)

[to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m54s)

[uh uh element](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m56s)

[name uh probably not call this flipper](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h38m59s)

[content 3D cont oh we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m05s)

[can't flipper content sounds great](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m08s)

[um and I want this to be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m13s)

[actual width so why I don't have to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m16s)

[think too hard I could keep hard coding](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m19s)

[things or I could just write a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m22s)

[binding done with it okay so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m25s)

[that I think that will make a difference](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m30s)

[because now this guy is going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m33s)

[size](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m35s)

[format um he's now going to size](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m38s)

[appropriately for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m40s)

[me there so he has appropriately sized](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m43s)

[but he also appears to be completely](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m47s)

[black](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m50s)

[which I have to take as a indication](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m51s)

[that so you know what let's do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m56s)

[this uh rientation](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h39m59s)

[horizontal I'm increasingly not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m05s)

[trusting I'm thinking the edit and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m08s)

[continue](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m10s)

[is all kinds of messed](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m11s)

[up when my class is named um with a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m18s)

[three at the beginning so I should](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m22s)

[clearly change](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m23s)

[it maybe we'll call it like plane 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m29s)

[test or](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m31s)

[something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m32s)

[um okay so this is not finding the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m35s)

[brushes for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m39s)

[animating right that's what we are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m43s)

[thinking is wrong](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m45s)

[or we've completely broken](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m48s)

[it based on the other changes that we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m52s)

[made because the other changes that we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m55s)

[made here were in](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h40m59s)

[the plane 3D new we tried to whack off](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m01s)

[all of this ending content stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m05s)

[too and it's very](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m08s)

[plausible that in doing this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m12s)

[group we have broken something important](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m17s)

[so let's put this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m21s)

[back until we have it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m23s)

[working uh let's see let's just I don't](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m26s)

[know a discard](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m30s)

[selection I think I still only want the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m37s)

[if for starting content because I'm not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m39s)

[going to set the ending content the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m41s)

[ending content is going to be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m43s)

[null so we're going to have to deal with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m45s)

[that but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m48s)

[I think we just deal with it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m52s)

[here we just do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m54s)

[this there let's try that see if let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h41m59s)

[see if this gives us a better](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m01s)

[experience because I think this might be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m07s)

[a little bit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m10s)

[nicer you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m18s)

[across uh let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m24s)

[see aha okay so Pro tip this when you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m26s)

[delete stuff don't assume it's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m32s)

[meaningless um let's see I like the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m35s)

[horizontal a little bit better of this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m37s)

[but that means I need to change this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m39s)

[from horizontal to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m41s)

[vertical](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m47s)

[and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m49s)

[uh we're going to put in a separator](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m52s)

[here and I I intentionally want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m54s)

[do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h42m58s)

[um uh rectangle](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m01s)

[margin of I don't know let's do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m04s)

[50 zero so I'm intentionally not putting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m08s)

[margin on either of these controls](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m12s)

[because we're rendering these things](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m13s)

[with visual brushes I want to eliminate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m15s)

[any possibility of margins or similar](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m17s)

[things on the control themselves](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m19s)

[affecting this and giving and giving me](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m22s)

[reason to waste time chasing my tail](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m24s)

[just because there was a margin](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m26s)

[somewhere I'm just going to put a blank](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m28s)

[control between](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m29s)

[them as a poor man's margin okay](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m31s)

[so okay so we clearly have some amount](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m36s)

[of rendering problems here](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m39s)

[but God it and that and because of the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m49s)

[lights you can see those lights in the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m52s)

[3D scene the um one of them's basically](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m54s)

[on my head looking straight down so as](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h43m59s)

[this thing turns to the right you can](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m01s)

[see how it kind of starts](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m02s)

[shadowing fading out and then from](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m06s)

[here so that that gets me to there so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m11s)

[then if](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m16s)

[that's if that's now working](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m17s)

[without leveraging the ending](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m21s)

[content how close is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m26s)

[our flippy flippy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m29s)

[control](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m35s)

[not so it's not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m37s)

[changing at least it's not doing what I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m41s)

[expected to be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m44s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m47s)

[okay but the nice part though is this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m48s)

[is now more or less](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m52s)

[working there is something interesting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m57s)

[to be said because it definitely looks](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h44m59s)

[like yeah we're once again getting into](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m02s)

[that fun sizing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m04s)

[problem something's off with the way it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m07s)

[sizes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m09s)

[these very weird like I wonder how much](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m14s)

[of this blur would go away if whatever](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m17s)

[was scaling this would knock it off um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m19s)

[we did already turn off the brushes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m22s)

[stretch](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m24s)

[right yeah brushes are already stretched](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m26s)

[off there could be something weird going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m33s)

[on here with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m35s)

[these that binding height](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m39s)

[property and there could be something](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m46s)

[going on there but I kind of doubt it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m48s)

[kind of doubt](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m52s)

[it um there is a scale and a rotate](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m54s)

[transform being applied](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h45m58s)

[here where is the scale transform get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m04s)

[values](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m08s)

[from right](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m11s)

[there I wonder on the the starting point](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m14s)

[if this is launch if the starting width](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m18s)

[and height if these aren't coming out at](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m22s)

[one I wonder if that's part of](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m25s)

[it width](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m33s)

[height so there are logical](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m36s)

[things but it's interesting because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m44s)

[width is being set to 200 height height](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m47s)

[is being set to 256 but I don't think](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m50s)

[that's I don't think that's the rendered](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m54s)

[height is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h46m56s)

[it get descendant bounds for sizing and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m00s)

[centering since desired size includes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m03s)

[layout white space whereas get descended](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m05s)

[bounds is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m07s)

[tighter I believe that but I'm also](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m09s)

[wondering if it's not desirable](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m13s)

[here uh let's see get this blah](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m17s)

[blah and then the rotate transform](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m25s)

[has no rotation actually](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m31s)

[applied well I guess that depends](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m36s)

[on](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m40s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m49s)

[new so what is the the size here because](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m53s)

[this thing is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m57s)

[clearly set to render](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h47m58s)

[at if we look at this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m03s)

[guy uh see flipper content 256 200 so](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m07s)

[the that does seem to be correct what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m12s)

[does this guy at 256 200 but you'll note](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m15s)

[the red is out out](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m18s)

[side the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m21s)

[bounds like it it's like or I should say](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m24s)

[the red it is drawing outside the red](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m27s)

[bounds interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m35s)

[interesting because this rectangle](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m38s)

[should have a fill](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m40s)

[brush right and if we want to delve The](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m43s)

[Fill](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m47s)

[brush and we look look at the fill](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m48s)

[property](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m51s)

[here uh no](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m52s)

[stretch stretch is set to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h48m55s)

[none interesting okay so something's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m01s)

[something's a little up with the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m04s)

[sizing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m06s)

[um that doesn't matter to me at the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m11s)

[moment what matters to me is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m15s)

[that we should be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m18s)

[swapping this guy](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m22s)

[out with new children and just to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m24s)

[confirm if I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m28s)

[take let's just do the La La Land test](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m30s)

[real quick if I take this guy and I give](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m33s)

[him](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m37s)

[a uh M material](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m38s)

[design card and we do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m42s)

[a uh uh transform](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h49m45s)

[that's a good](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m18s)

[question I could probably turn on clip](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m20s)

[to bounds on the plane 3D my fear would](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m23s)

[be is then it would cut it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m27s)

[off so yeah so this guy so this guy's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m31s)

[perfectly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m34s)

[happy um we can try the clip to bounds](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m35s)

[on this guy real quick and just see what](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m38s)

[he does I don't know how the 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m40s)

[stuff deals with](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m44s)

[that um let's see](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m47s)

[clip to bounds](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m51s)

[on yeah so there's the there's the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m53s)

[problem with clip to bounds is you get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h50m58s)

[Behavior so can we clip yes but we](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m00s)

[probably explicitly don't want to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m03s)

[because we're trying to get into](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m06s)

[situations where it can do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m07s)

[this so we kind of want to let it do its](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m12s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m18s)

[you](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m22s)

[know I'm kind of curious I I know I had](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m30s)

[played with it](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m33s)

[before just staring at this position is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m36s)

[making me wonder how possible this is to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m39s)

[do without the 3D](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m41s)

[stuff it seems like there should be a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m47s)

[means by](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m50s)

[which given a flat rectangle and a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m52s)

[regular Matrix transform that this would](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m55s)

[be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h51m56s)

[doable I don't know if I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m00s)

[attack that now because we you also lose](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m02s)

[like the the lighting source and that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m05s)

[kind of stuff that the 3D modeling stuff](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m07s)

[gives](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m09s)

[you but I don't know how actually like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m11s)

[lighting sources I don't think are that](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m15s)

[important for people who are just](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m17s)

[interested in this this animation like](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m18s)

[that's functionally all we're looking to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m20s)

[do is this animation and I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m21s)

[if if that would be](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m28s)

[achievable like it might](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m33s)

[be seems like it might be so I may play](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m39s)

[around with that a little bit okay let's](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m43s)

[get this checked in because this is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m45s)

[better than where we were um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m48s)

[um and we're going to put this in place](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m53s)

[uh let's see adding demo page app to](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h52m56s)

[test the plane](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m01s)

[3D uh need to figure out if we can swap](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m06s)

[the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m13s)

[content good flip and I think the answer](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m15s)

[is yes](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m18s)

[I think the answer is](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m21s)

[yes that's going to get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m26s)

[pushed okay and I think that might leave](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m30s)

[me with a nice natural ending spot um](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m33s)

[for those people who weren't here at the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m38s)

[beginning uh there is a](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m40s)

[video I'll have a sneak um on the get](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m44s)

[augment your your Dev experience uh the](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h53m59s)

[the git Kraken CLI is not a replacement](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m03s)

[for git.exe at all um it is explicitly](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m05s)

[not that um but it is a augmentation for](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m08s)

[people who like to live in the terminal](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m12s)

[stuff with it so I've got a video I](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m15s)

[think it's like 22 minutes long](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m18s)

[something like that um kind of going](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m20s)

[through all of the various features and](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m22s)

[how to leverage it and I didn't hit](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m23s)

[everything but I I hit what I think are](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m26s)

[highlights uh so that will be coming out](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m29s)

[shortly there may be something that I do](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m32s)

[related to Cloud patches but so far](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m35s)

[every time I've played with them they've](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m38s)

[it the there there's a reason they're](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m40s)

[still in preview I'll put it that way](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m43s)

[they're cool when they work and it's not](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m45s)

[that hard for me to break](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m48s)

[um it seems like a lot of my flows tend](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m50s)

[to not fall into the happy case so but](https://youtu.be/jmEoS3L0WnY?t=01h54m53s)
