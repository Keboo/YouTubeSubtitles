[absolute hoot I I have thoroughly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m36s)

[enjoyed putting together this material](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m38s)

[Um at the build conference I even got to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m40s)

[with wrong one hang on this guy Anders](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m45s)

[So for people who are unfamiliar Anders](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m50s)

[Hillsburg is often referred to as the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m52s)

[father of C Uh he is very brilliant Uh I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h02m55s)

[four programming languages to his name](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m00s)

[um Deli Turbo Pascal C and Typescript So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m03s)

[he currently runs the TypeScript team Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m08s)

[but he originally did the C# team So I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m10s)

[got to I got to chat with him for a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m13s)

[little bit And I also got to chat with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m14s)

[Matt Stoensson who's currently running](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m16s)

[the C team So it was great It was lots](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m18s)

[of useful information And then I had um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m22s)

[Fred who is a member of the C team uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m25s)

[captive in a booth with me at Build for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m28s)

[several hours which was awesome So I I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m30s)

[had lots of fun I was just tickled to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m34s)

[death and very excited the entire](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m36s)

[conference I don't know what it was Like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m38s)

[I don't know that the build conference](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m40s)

[was much different than build](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m41s)

[conferences in the past but for some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m43s)

[reason this time around I enjoyed it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m45s)

[more So for what it's worth like I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m47s)

[enjoyed it more Um on the note of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m50s)

[build conference if people are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m53s)

[interested in stuff to to look at so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m54s)

[this playlist here from Microsoft is all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h03m56s)

[of the the dev tools and net related](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m00s)

[stuff from Build Now there's obviously a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m02s)

[lot of uh really uh interesting sessions](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m05s)

[that were in here Now a couple things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m09s)

[I'm going to point out The ones here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m11s)

[that are like the the 15minute sessions](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m14s)

[I enjoyed these a lot while I was at the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m18s)

[conference They weren't necessarily in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m20s)

[the big rooms They they had their um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m22s)

[expert area with a lot of booths and a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m24s)

[couple theaters in that big main room](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m27s)

[And these were basically like 15-minute](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m29s)

[lightning talks But I found that these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m31s)

[lightning talks were really dense](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m33s)

[information-wise Like the presenters had](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m36s)

[to try to cram as much as they could](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m38s)

[into a 15minute block And there was some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m42s)

[absolute gold in some of these Right So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m45s)

[if I can call out just a few that I that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m49s)

[I thought were were very good The MCP](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m51s)

[one if you're at all interested in um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m54s)

[agent communication um or building MCP](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h04m57s)

[servers that one was great And again](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m00s)

[these talks are dense in information um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m02s)

[with the expectation that even though](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m05s)

[they can only scratch the surface if you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m08s)

[want to go deeper um go and look into it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m10s)

[This no projects with C the .NET run](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m13s)

[this one is actually really cool Um this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m16s)

[this is one of the features that really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m19s)

[excites me for uh .NET 10 So you can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m20s)

[grab preview bits uh and play with some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m25s)

[of this stuff but some of the the bits](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m27s)

[aren't actually expected to come no till](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m29s)

[November And there were demos where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m31s)

[people were literally grabbing nightly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m33s)

[bits and so stuff went wrong right in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m35s)

[addition to AI not always behaving the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m38s)

[way you want it's people were running](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m40s)

[nightly builds and things went haywire](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m43s)

[Like I'm always surprised that they do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m46s)

[this Like I went and did one of the labs](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m48s)

[and it was clear that the lab had](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m51s)

[changed between like and I I know that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m53s)

[they had people intentionally go through](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m56s)

[every lab test all the steps make sure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h05m57s)

[everything was perfect right the problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m00s)

[is then everybody cuts out a release](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m02s)

[right at build And so it's like you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m05s)

[tested your lab with all the stuff prior](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m08s)

[to build and then all the releases hit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m10s)

[And it's like there was stuff that was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m12s)

[broken and a lot of it I think was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m15s)

[related to the simultaneous release on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m16s)

[all of this stuff Oh Izzy it was great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m19s)

[It was great I like I'm talking MS](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m21s)

[builds at the moment because this was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m23s)

[this was absolutely amazing I I have not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m24s)

[gotten through this entire playlist](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m27s)

[myself Some of these I I was able to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m28s)

[attend in person Um this learn how to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m30s)

[write C better in 15 minutes This is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m33s)

[useful but it's not as useful for people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m36s)

[who have kept up to date on latest C#](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m39s)

[features a lot of pattern matching some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m41s)

[stuff like Mads was great I actually sat](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m43s)

[in the front row and was cheering them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m45s)

[on Um but like it's good but there's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m47s)

[nothing revolutionary in the in this one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m51s)

[right it's it's mostly trying to get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m53s)

[those developers because there was a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m55s)

[shockingly large number of developers at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m57s)

[the build conference that were still](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h06m58s)

[running old .NET framework stuff and the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m00s)

[big question was hey how do I update](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m02s)

[right because Microsoft teased out their](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m05s)

[new co-pilot enabled upgrade assistant](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m07s)

[which is awesome right it was it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m09s)

[really cool But the problem was that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m11s)

[upgrade assistant and its current state](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m14s)

[does modern.net to modern.net So think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m17s)

[net 5 to net 9 That's great but that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m20s)

[not the hard upgrades that people are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m24s)

[struggling with right like that is not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m26s)

[like usually if you're already on net 5](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m28s)

[getting to net 9 in a lot of cases is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m31s)

[changing a five to a nine right there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m34s)

[there's other stuff with analyzers and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m36s)

[similar things that come in and gets it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m38s)

[play So it's like it's not I don't want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m39s)

[to um I don't want to underell how nice](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m41s)

[the tool is but it wasn't the problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m43s)

[people were really struggling with right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m45s)

[a lot of people were trying to figure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m47s)

[out how do I get from .NET Framework to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m48s)

[modern.NET](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m51s)

[like what's my upgrade path there um and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m52s)

[there's not great answers The C-Pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m56s)

[infused one they did say uh net](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h07m57s)

[framework support is on the road map and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m00s)

[forthcoming](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m02s)

[When DBD but it they did say on the road](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m04s)

[map and forthcoming So that for anybody](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m08s)

[stuck on .NET framework the good news is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m10s)

[there may be a nice AI help way because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m13s)

[doing those migrations is not really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m16s)

[exciting code like at at my job we help](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m18s)

[a lot of big companies migrate old stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m21s)

[to modern stuff because you know they're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m24s)

[they're out of support things are dead](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m26s)

[whatever right and they need they need](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m28s)

[somebody to help do it and it's not it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m29s)

[not a trivial like you can't usually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m32s)

[reax your way to victory on those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m34s)

[situations It's a little it takes a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m35s)

[little more thought but there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m38s)

[boilerplate And so even if the co-pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m40s)

[can do you know 50% of it that's that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m42s)

[like that's a huge number of dev hours](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m45s)

[we're saving And that's awesome So that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m47s)

[that's kind of what we what it's it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m50s)

[looking at right now Um and definitely](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m52s)

[worth going if you're at all interested](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m54s)

[in Typescript Um this talk from Anders](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m56s)

[another one that I that I sat in on was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h08m59s)

[excellent as well Especially if for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m02s)

[anybody who is familiar there was a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m05s)

[little bit of a we'll say flare online](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m07s)

[because the the TypeScript compiler they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m10s)

[they recently announced that they were](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m13s)

[rewriting it in Go and there was all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m15s)

[kinds of craziness that went into it Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m18s)

[and I like Anders did interviews a lot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m22s)

[of people threw in why why didn't they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m26s)

[use C# blah blah blah Like there was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m27s)

[stuff going all over the place It's like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m29s)

[the guy who literally invented C# didn't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m31s)

[pick C right but like I I have to really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m33s)

[respect Andrew's decision because like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m38s)

[in this talk he outlines kind of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m41s)

[criterias that they were going to um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m43s)

[that they were looking for in what they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m46s)

[were wanting to support and why Go was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m48s)

[the best fit given those criteria right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m52s)

[like C it is an amazing language that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m54s)

[you can do a ton of stuff with But there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h09m56s)

[are reasons that different programming](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m00s)

[styles and types like sometimes a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m02s)

[functional language solves things better](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m04s)

[And if depending on the type of problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m08s)

[you're solving that might be a better](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m10s)

[choice And it's like his argument kind](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m12s)

[of boiled down to here's the problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m14s)

[we're solving We're building a compiler](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m16s)

[right we're not building apps or other](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m18s)

[things like that We are building a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m21s)

[compiler It needs to have the following](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m22s)

[behaviors We want to maintain X Y and Z](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m24s)

[to make maintainability of the code and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m27s)

[people who are familiar with the repo so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m29s)

[they won't just throw away all that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m30s)

[knowledge right like there was extra](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m32s)

[stuff went in there Uh is it an offline](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m33s)

[AI helper uh probably won't be able to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m36s)

[be allowed to use any of that on my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m38s)

[machines Uh might be the beginning of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m40s)

[Skynet Um there are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m43s)

[You know what let's actually look Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m47s)

[I uh the I don't know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h10m53s)

[I don't know that the the the so the the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m00s)

[co-pilot infused one is not because it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m03s)

[needs co-pilot which requires being able](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m06s)

[to reach out to I I I can only imagine](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m09s)

[an army of various systems backed by](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m12s)

[Azure AI or similar um but the old](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m14s)

[school upgrade assistance](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m18s)

[This is this is also the one So yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m21s)

[this is a beautiful example of Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m23s)

[sucking at naming Um they they have two](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m26s)

[tools that are in active support right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m30s)

[now Both called upgrade assistant Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m32s)

[that's not going to confuse anyone So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m36s)

[this one I think the name I heard](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m40s)

[several people use was like classical](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m41s)

[upgrade assistant right this one can run](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m43s)

[offline but this is more of like an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m46s)

[expert system level stuff right it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m48s)

[going to it like it'll help migrate your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m51s)

[stuff forward It'll bring your CS Proj](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m54s)

[up to modern SDK format All of that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m56s)

[lovely stuff that you kind of would](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h11m58s)

[expect in in a forward migration like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m00s)

[that You get that kind of stuff with it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m02s)

[So this one I believe can run entirely](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m05s)

[offline once once it's downloaded and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m09s)

[whatnot Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m11s)

[don't quote me on that I was hoping](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m15s)

[there would be something in here that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m16s)

[would actually show it because this was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m18s)

[actually one of the tools that I push](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m20s)

[people towards when they when they say](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m22s)

[they had .NET framework code that they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m23s)

[were looking to migrate because this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m25s)

[thing has a report that it'll give you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m26s)

[that will show you how like what your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m29s)

[dependencies are and how far away are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m32s)

[you from being able to rev to to a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m33s)

[modern version of .NET like what what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m35s)

[are the risk areas to look at the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m37s)

[co-pilot infused one Yeah not an offline](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m39s)

[u related option which is disappointing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m43s)

[Um very disappointing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m46s)

[but yeah it it does come back down to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m49s)

[the idea of it's it uses um your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m51s)

[existing GitHub copilot license So as](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m54s)

[long as you have a license there you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m57s)

[should be good to go Um this one here uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h12m59s)

[Mads Christensen not to be confused with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m03s)

[Mads Thorensson as many people do Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m05s)

[this one I am actually this is on my my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m08s)

[watch list of things to go back through](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m11s)

[and do because I want to um this one for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m12s)

[Visual Studio as well as Nougat These](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m15s)

[both look very exciting to me Um this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m18s)

[this was the closing keynote on Thursday](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m24s)

[This one's just funny frankly Like so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m26s)

[Scott Hansselman is usually entertaining](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m30s)

[regardless of what he is in right like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m33s)

[so it's good there Um I also felt like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m36s)

[because the first two days keynotes were](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m40s)

[very much we'll call it hype train Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m42s)

[this one I felt like brought the AI](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m46s)

[message into reality right like here's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m49s)

[the hype Like the first two keynotes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m52s)

[were here's all the hype and then this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m53s)

[one was okay now we're going to actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m55s)

[do one of the most important tasks that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h13m58s)

[humanity needs Retrieve a pop off of a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m00s)

[table and deliver it to a human Right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m03s)

[that is a very important task One that I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m04s)

[thoroughly support I I support AI being](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m07s)

[able to deliver me a Mountain Dew That](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m10s)

[is that is an important task They used](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m13s)

[Coke It's fine I can repurpose it But it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m15s)

[like I I no spoilers It's funny to watch](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m19s)

[and it shows the current state of a lot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m22s)

[of the AI stuff So there are things that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m25s)

[are really cool and also I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m27s)

[accurately portrays the current state of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m29s)

[where things are Yeah or a pizza That's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m31s)

[true Like we do need something to that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m34s)

[the Mountain Dew can wash down So I I'd](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m37s)

[accept a pizza](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m39s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m41s)

[yeah CS project less monoliths Yeah it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m43s)

[it is it is interesting I I don't know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m46s)

[that they will ever go project less the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m48s)

[the the net run the bare C part of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m51s)

[part of the idea here C occasionally](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m55s)

[gets feature envy um from other](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h14m58s)

[languages and this is something from](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m00s)

[like uh Node or Rust or or other ones](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m03s)

[where your build scripts are written in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m07s)

[the language that you're looking to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m10s)

[compile which is kind of a cool thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m11s)

[that you can do where like I can just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m14s)

[you know cargo build and if I find the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m17s)

[right rust file It It builds the thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m19s)

[and what I can put in there is just Rust](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m22s)

[which is like it it's kind of a nice way](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m25s)

[of being able to do that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m28s)

[Now not saying that you have to do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m30s)

[this way um but that was one of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m32s)

[driving factors is trying to make it so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m34s)

[that people who are familiar with those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m37s)

[types of systems and want to structure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m39s)

[their things to feel a little bit more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m41s)

[that way so that they have that same](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m43s)

[kind of um way to do it But uh Damian](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m46s)

[also](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m50s)

[uh demos in this session a really like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m52s)

[they have an upgrade path and this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m54s)

[one of the things I think they've done](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m56s)

[poorly in the past is they'll introduce](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m57s)

[a new feature and the problem is is if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h15m59s)

[you once you once it times comes time to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m02s)

[grow up and and do a a real app that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m04s)

[beyond demo where it's like well okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m06s)

[now you got to do all the stuff It's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m09s)

[like that's fine but that leaves kind of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m10s)

[a bad taste in your mouth It's like why](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m13s)

[don't I have a nice upgrade path right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m15s)

[so it's one of those situations where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m18s)

[this one they actually have an upgrade](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m20s)

[story for which is he demos and it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m22s)

[pretty cool So I won't spoil it but it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m25s)

[is pretty cool and it makes me very](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m27s)

[excited for uh .NET 14 right so that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m28s)

[that one is very much um on the list I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m33s)

[will warn you there's like 56 different](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m37s)

[ones in here Um Hanselman and Tab I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m39s)

[unfortunately was working the booth at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m42s)

[the point this one went on but this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m44s)

[on you can see I've started This is on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m46s)

[my list of ones to get to because one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m48s)

[Hanselman's entertaining and two uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m51s)

[Steven Ta I think is considered the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m53s)

[foremost expert on everything like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m56s)

[performance and uh TPL and similar like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h16m59s)

[the man's brilliant like and he does he](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m03s)

[has no concept of what a blog post link](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m06s)

[should be for people who have seen his](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m08s)

[blog post you know what I mean like they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m10s)

[are insane Um yeah Let's see I quite](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m13s)

[like the packages bit instead of putting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m17s)

[that in the CS Pro That way any unused](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m19s)

[ones can be stripped out easier Yeah And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m22s)

[and that's the thing is it's because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m24s)

[there's a nice upgrade story It seems](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m26s)

[like we're clo we're getting towards](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m28s)

[that point where it's like you can you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m30s)

[can structure it the way you want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m32s)

[because we already have a little bit of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m34s)

[some packaging stuff and uh some of it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m36s)

[um I I wanted to compare it to the the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m39s)

[syntax that they had put into the net](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m42s)

[interactive because I think it's fairly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m44s)

[close to that because that's something](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m46s)

[that's very similar uh in a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h17m48s)

[an MCP server actually interact with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h19m52s)

[Playright was pretty slick It especially](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h19m55s)

[for people who have spent a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h19m58s)

[time fighting with UI tests It was kind](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h19m59s)

[of cool Like it was it was it was kind](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m02s)

[really cool 15-minute lightning talk](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m18s)

[where he did Playright with Aspire](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m21s)

[Uh and and it was basically I want to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m25s)

[UI testing with Playright I have an app](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m29s)

[I'm going to host it in Aspire I'm going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m32s)

[to use Aspire as the host to be able to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m34s)

[spin up my whole infrastructure locally](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m35s)

[to get it running so I can run my test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m37s)

[against it It was a really nice](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m39s)

[demonstration of kind of putting all of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m40s)

[the pieces together Uh and a great one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m42s)

[Uh 81 degrees at the moment in Arizona](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m45s)

[Cool for the it uh to be the Ring Bears](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m47s)

[Yeah Yeah exactly It'll be awesome](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m51s)

[Oh boy Most important question Izzy you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m55s)

[worry me when you lead like that But](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m57s)

[yeah I think those ones are some of are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h20m59s)

[some of my favorite Did they mention any](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m01s)

[WPF updates um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m02s)

[there were So did they announce them on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m06s)

[any stage i think the answer is no There](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m09s)

[was no direct WPF booth There was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m12s)

[technically a Windows desktop](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m14s)

[development booth and there was a .NET](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m17s)

[booth Um I was in the .NET booth and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m19s)

[there was I think three people that came](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m23s)

[up to talk WPF and only one that did it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m25s)

[while I was there which was very](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m28s)

[disappointing to me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m29s)

[Um because the the number of WPF updates](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m31s)

[are are fairly low Like they do have a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m38s)

[in uh so on the what's new andnet page](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m40s)

[the is this going to get me there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m43s)

[this is here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m47s)

[Um one of these has there is a small](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m51s)

[amount of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m54s)

[yeah what's new in WPF and net 10 So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h21m57s)

[this is the this is the sum total of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m00s)

[everything that is expected to be in WPF](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m04s)

[and .NET 10 So on one hand and this was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m07s)

[one thing to to point out to people like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m09s)

[Microsoft has said that they are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m12s)

[committed to WPF that it is not going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m14s)

[away and they there are updates Now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m16s)

[admittedly you look at these there's not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m20s)

[a lot of updates here The team working](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m22s)

[on this is kind of small right a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m24s)

[the stuff is they're they're updating](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m27s)

[their default theming to fluent which is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m28s)

[great unless you're using my material](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m30s)

[design library in which case it's like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m32s)

[eh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m33s)

[but you know a couple a couple nice](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m35s)

[little things around the clipboard not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m37s)

[binary formatter going away great like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m40s)

[fixing some some bug stuff great like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m43s)

[for the most part if you're doing WPF](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m47s)

[development the short version is if you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m49s)

[rev to net 10 you're going to pick up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m50s)

[all of the thenet improvements that are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m53s)

[that are in the BCL which is usually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m56s)

[good You're going to pick up all of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h22m58s)

[the compiler and performance](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m00s)

[improvements there which is good right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m01s)

[like those ones always come through And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m03s)

[there might be a handful of small WPF](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m06s)

[things that you notice](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m08s)

[And that that's a that's about it right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m10s)

[so they they cleaned up some of their](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m13s)

[performance because remember WPF was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m15s)

[released the same year Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m17s)

[released generics So WPF was built](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m20s)

[without generics because it wasn't done](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m23s)

[yet](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m26s)

[So like there's been a lot of stuff in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m27s)

[there like uh around performance and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m29s)

[boxing and similar So some of these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m32s)

[things it's like great right like that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m33s)

[I don't doubt that they got a nice](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m36s)

[little performance bump by by scrapping](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m37s)

[all of the boxing operations that we're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m40s)

[going through Yeah And all the new](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m42s)

[syntactic sugar 100% 100%](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m44s)

[And I don't know if you you saw it Izzy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m47s)

[but my talk uh on Tuesday This is my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m49s)

[this is my my first demo CS Proj like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m53s)

[just going to point this out Net 10](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m57s)

[target framework lang version one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h23m59s)

[It's going to be fun I like I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m03s)

[have a hoot It's it it's going to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m06s)

[epic Um so couple I I I actually took](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m08s)

[pictures while I was at the build](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m13s)

[conference So I one of the things so for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m14s)

[anybody who's thinking of going to a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m18s)

[Microsoft conference one of the things I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m19s)

[usually tell people is prioritize](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m21s)

[if you are in person prioritize things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m25s)

[that you can't stream later online So I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m27s)

[oftentimes don't necessarily attend a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m30s)

[huge number of the sessions unless I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m32s)

[have a reason to like because there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m34s)

[something different about the sessions](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m37s)

[watching the recording versus being in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m38s)

[person There's 100% something different](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m40s)

[So if it's something I really care about](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m42s)

[I'll attend the session Or if I have a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m44s)

[reason to like want to try to connect](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m45s)

[with the speaker I I'll I'll definitely](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m47s)

[go to the session because those are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m49s)

[things you can't do after the fact](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m51s)

[online right but if it's just I want the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m52s)

[content from the session yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m54s)

[probably skipping it and doing something](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m56s)

[else One of the things that Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m57s)

[offered there was certification test So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h24m59s)

[I went and took uh a cert test and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m00s)

[passed So woohoo Yay That was fun Um so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m02s)

[I have another on my name Um one of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m08s)

[things that they set up they set up an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m10s)

[because it's Microsoft's um 50th](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m12s)

[anniversary this year right so uh if we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m15s)

[back up 50 years that's 1975 I was not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m18s)

[born yet Uh but they had set up this uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m22s)

[oh thank you frozen Fusion Yeah it it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m28s)

[was good Like so for people maybe I'll](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m30s)

[I'll comment on this for people who](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m33s)

[haven't done a Microsoft C before here's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m35s)

[here's the things to know about uh the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m38s)

[like so a 104 so like for example this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m43s)

[is the one I did as your um as your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m46s)

[administrator associate so level](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m50s)

[intermediate this is so first thing to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m52s)

[know about Microsofts](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m55s)

[you cannot treat the number like a 104](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h25m57s)

[as like the same way you would treat](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m01s)

[like a college class cuz or university](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m03s)

[classes right cuz in the US our](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m06s)

[university classes like 100 levels are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m08s)

[your first years 200 levels are your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m10s)

[second years 300 levels are your third](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m12s)

[years and 400s are your fourth years](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m14s)

[That's generally how it goes right um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m16s)

[Microsoft clearly hasn't gotten the memo](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m20s)

[on that And some like you will note this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m21s)

[is a 100 level thing but it's inter](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m25s)

[intermediate](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m27s)

[So like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m29s)

[the their numbering scheme is wacky So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m31s)

[just keep that in mind But I if you if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m34s)

[you want to go through and do it the the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m38s)

[one thing to note the system that they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m40s)

[go through gives you access to Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m41s)

[Learn It is not a full browser If you tr](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m44s)

[if if Microsoft Learn has a link that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m47s)

[would take you outside of Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h26m49s)

[are just buzzwords that don't logically](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h27m49s)

[there there's a bit of that kind of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m01s)

[say not by much enough to pass but there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m11s)

[was there was not a there was not nearly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m16s)

[not a very big buffer but I but I passed](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m21s)

[it Um but it is worth going through and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m24s)

[um being familiar with all of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m28s)

[systems And I went in and took this on a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m31s)

[whim Like I was like I do enough of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m32s)

[stuff dayto day I think I have a good a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m35s)

[good handle on most of this Uh I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m39s)

[rubbish at tests I It depends too on how](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m42s)

[quick you can look stuff up I think some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m45s)

[of it what I would say is if you do the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m47s)

[practice test and you get somewhat](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m49s)

[familiar with how they've organized](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m51s)

[Microsoft learn you can do pretty like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m52s)

[in some ways it's how quickly can you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m56s)

[search Microsoft learn without Google](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h28m58s)

[right you can't s you have to use the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m00s)

[built-in search so if you know how to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m02s)

[that and glean information quickly you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m04s)

[can get through a lot of it because I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m06s)

[use probably like 75% of the the service](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m09s)

[that I was being quizzed on and the rest](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m12s)

[of it I'm like I'll just go and look it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m14s)

[up like ARM templates I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m16s)

[hardly ever use ARM templates This is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m19s)

[not an area of strength for me And I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m22s)

[sitting there and there was questions](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m24s)

[about what does this function do inside](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m25s)

[of an ARM template I'm like I got no](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m27s)

[freaking idea Um now I can guess based](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m29s)

[on the name that it's but there was one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m32s)

[I'm trying to remember what it was It](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m34s)

[was it was a function around like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m35s)

[getting the index of a count or](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m36s)

[something and it was asking effectively](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m38s)

[the question was is this zerobased or](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m40s)

[one based I'm like this is such a stupid](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m42s)

[question I don't know One I would](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m44s)

[probably just run the template and look](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m46s)

[whether I got a zero or a one but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m48s)

[ultimately I just hunted Microsoft learn](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m52s)

[to find it So but if you're interested](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m54s)

[they are very worthwhile They do make](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m56s)

[you renew every 12 months but the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h29m58s)

[renewal test is stupid easy It's like 20](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m00s)

[questions full open book in your browser](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m03s)

[Like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m06s)

[if you can Google you can you can pass](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m08s)

[the renewal Like it's it's hard to fail](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m10s)

[Um and I think they let you do that one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m12s)

[or two times before they make you retake](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m15s)

[a full test And the the updated](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m17s)

[questions are usually focused just on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m19s)

[what's changed in the last year So they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m21s)

[try to keep things updated which is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m24s)

[which is nice right so did a cert test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m25s)

[They did not they they they're like "Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m29s)

[do you want a picture?" And I said yes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m31s)

[before realizing what the question](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m33s)

[actually was Because though the nice](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m35s)

[lady took my phone to take a picture](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m38s)

[box of these happy new year streamers](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m41s)

[and they were about to like shout the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m43s)

[same way like they do sometimes in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m45s)

[restaurants when you tell them it's your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m47s)

[to look like 1975 These are sleeper](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h30m59s)

[just artificially buzzed it But like it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m14s)

[was cool You got to go through if you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m17s)

[knew a little bit of basic Um it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m19s)

[quite helpful which I did basic a very](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m21s)

[got me a like a you know a poor man's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m38s)

[learn to program with basic type It it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m41s)

[was more gy than than it was actual](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m44s)

[programming but it kind of taught some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m46s)

[of the basic CS concepts Um and I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m47s)

[sitting there scratching my head trying](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m51s)

[to remember what the heck I had learned](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h31m52s)

[motorcycle shop of all places but they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h32m36s)

[found out I knew tech and so I became](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h32m38s)

[introductions to actually doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h32m51s)

[something on a Unix system because every](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h32m53s)

[getting partial properties So rather](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h37m59s)

[than needing to decorate a field with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m01s)

[the observable property you can actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m04s)

[decorate a partial property with the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m06s)

[observable property attribute and get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m08s)

[the same thing So that's kind of nice if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m09s)

[feel rather than trying to explain to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m11s)

[people the difference between properties](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h38m13s)

[I love it So it's always cool So we had](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m28s)

[a great chat Um because the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m31s)

[unfortunately the session I spoke at was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m33s)

[a community session So it wasn't 5'12](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m36s)

[H I love it We have another word for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m42s)

[that It's called six](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m44s)

[Uh but yeah so the community session I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m46s)

[was at was all all basically sharing the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m48s)

[perspective of what does it mean to be a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m51s)

[Microsoft MVP So me and three other MVPs](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m52s)

[kind of presented our stories of how we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m55s)

[became MVPs And it was one of those we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h39m57s)

[weren't really sure like what like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m00s)

[because they had left a decent chunk of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m03s)

[time at the end for Q&A and that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m05s)

[always weird because if nobody comes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m08s)

[with any questions it just feels awkward](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m10s)

[because then you just kind of end early](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m13s)

[and so it's like oh man and so but like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m15s)

[Justin the the guy who is uh one of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m19s)

[people who oversees the MVP program he](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m21s)

[he did he was he was great great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m23s)

[moderator um and he had kind of come](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m25s)

[with some some leading preparatory](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m28s)

[questions and whatnot just to make sure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m30s)

[that there was something to fill the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m32s)

[time if we needed and we didn't need any](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m33s)

[of it Like we had people asking lots of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m34s)

[questions People stuck around later to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m37s)

[talk It was really shocking to me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m39s)

[because our session I didn't realize](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m41s)

[this was going to overlap with lunchtime](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m43s)

[So people actually delayed getting food](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m45s)

[to come listen to us talk which I was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m47s)

[flattered about because frankly I don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m49s)

[know if I would have given up food in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m51s)

[exchange for listening to me speak Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m52s)

[but I can listen to myself talk pretty](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m54s)

[much whenever I want So with that said](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m56s)

[it it was actually really fun So there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h40m59s)

[was I I think it it was kind of hard to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m02s)

[tell 20-ish people maybe um like because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m04s)

[we were near the community area had like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m08s)

[a lot of tables and chairs So it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m11s)

[kind of unclear how many people were](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m12s)

[watching and paying attention versus](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m15s)

[just present So that was a little](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m17s)

[awkward I had a couple colleagues come](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m19s)

[in um and and listen They said it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m21s)

[great So I'm going to believe them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m24s)

[because I have no reason not to But yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m26s)

[so like uh I can't stand listening to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m29s)

[myself ever Don't don't ever don't ever](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m32s)

[do do streaming Izzy because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m35s)

[unfortunately that's what a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m37s)

[streaming is is sometimes just listening](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m38s)

[to yourself talk Um and sometimes I feel](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m40s)

[like I just need to get it out of my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m44s)

[system](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m45s)

[But yeah so that was that was that was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m47s)

[the build conference from from my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m49s)

[perspective So I I'll share this link](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m50s)

[again This is the playlist You can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m52s)

[obviously go and find a lot more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m54s)

[sessions on a lot of other things In my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m56s)

[opinion and if you're watching my stream](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h41m59s)

[these are the sessions that are most](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m01s)

[applicable to the stuff that I like to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m04s)

[do right c developer tools There's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m07s)

[obviously a bunch of MCP related stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m10s)

[uh and similar that are that are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m13s)

[littered throughout here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m16s)

[Um but it is it was very much a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m18s)

[worthwhile session I'm still surprised I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m22s)

[don't see Jeff Fritz's session in here I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m24s)

[may have to go hunt that one down Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m27s)

[because that that one was very very good](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m29s)

[I the only thing I was a little and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m33s)

[and I went up to him and talked to him](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m36s)

[afterwards If you if you find it and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m37s)

[watch it I will warn you because he uses](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m39s)

[various cities in his sample You know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m42s)

[Seattle Chicago where he's from And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m44s)

[he said Spokane](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m46s)

[and I'm and I was a little disappointed](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m49s)

[because it's Spokane where I'm from So I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m51s)

[like I realize he was in Washington](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m54s)

[state He's not from Washington State](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h42m57s)

[Like usually like where I'm from there's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m00s)

[a lot of uh Native American names of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m02s)

[landmarks cities roads etc And so oftent](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m06s)

[times that's how we pick out who the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m08s)

[locals are is like some of them just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m11s)

[like the letters and the sounds don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m15s)

[line up Like they just don't And so it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m18s)

[becomes real easy to pick out who got it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m21s)

[right and who got it wrong Like Spokane](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m23s)

[like it's spelled Spokane Like that is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m26s)

[how it is spelled I get why people do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m29s)

[but it's one of those it's just off](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m32s)

[Cordelane Pere like all of these ones](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m34s)

[are are various ways that we like to uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m36s)

[test who the locals are It's always fun](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m39s)

[to be able to do that So I I went up I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m41s)

[went up to him afterwards I'm like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m44s)

[feedback." And I got a he he he we joked](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m47s)

[about it It was all good But yeah it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m51s)

[it was like "Oh man that one thing just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m54s)

[and I'm sure like me and a colleague I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h43m58s)

[think might have been the only two](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m00s)

[people from Spokane that were in the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m01s)

[co-pilots like I've teased this out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m14s)

[before this GitHub co-pilot uh global](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m16s)

[boot camp that um uh Intelllettech is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m19s)

[doing I'm the primary presenter So if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m22s)

[you're sick and tired of listening to me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m25s)

[talk this is not the event for you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m27s)

[because there will be a lot of that Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m28s)

[but we have opened it up online as well](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m31s)

[So if you are interested um whether if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m35s)

[if you're in person even better right uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m39s)

[but if you'd rather just do it online as](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m41s)

[well that is an option Um do note that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m44s)

[these times are Pacific Standard Time So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m47s)

[this is going to be uh coming up later](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m51s)

[in June So 3 hours of working through](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m54s)

[GitHub copilot um AI assisted coding Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h44m58s)

[this is it We intentionally kind of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m03s)

[waited well one Microsoft wanted it in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m05s)

[June but the the timing of it was very](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m08s)

[intentional to have it come after build](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m10s)

[That way all of the announcements from](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m12s)

[Build could kind of be brought in as](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m14s)

[part of this Right So um which there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m17s)

[there's a lot of cool stuff that that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m21s)

[came from the AI stuff um in build I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m23s)

[think the thing that most excites me is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m26s)

[just the so the agent mode of co-pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m28s)

[in Visual Studio I think is probably one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m31s)

[of my my favorites In fact I might just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m34s)

[I can just show this So like earlier](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m36s)

[today I had I had a situation where I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m39s)

[had written a GitHub action right and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m42s)

[but I was wanting to do something](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m46s)

[similar but in Azure DevOps I literally](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m48s)

[just brought the file and said "Hey](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m50s)

[Copilot convert this."](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m52s)

[And it it like it it to be clear it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m55s)

[didn't get it right but it got it like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h45m58s)

[80% right which was signi which saved me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m01s)

[a significant period of time because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m05s)

[that was 80% I just had to spot check](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m06s)

[rather than having to fix So like that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m09s)

[that is there Um if you have get up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m12s)

[co-pilot and you can you can grab the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m15s)

[free tier stuff as well Uh 2 a.m to 8](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m17s)

[a.m Maybe I should get my camp bed for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m20s)

[office on that day Izzy I like I will](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m23s)

[say this from if if it were at 2 a.m](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m26s)

[that would be a hard cell for me to get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m30s)

[up that early I I I would give you a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m31s)

[pass for not coming Like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m33s)

[I initially we were only doing in person](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m37s)

[and then we had enough requests for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m40s)

[online We're like you know what let](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m42s)

[we're set up for streaming We might as](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m44s)

[well let's try to make this happen right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m46s)

[like they've been for a while we had](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m49s)

[constant AV issues around our streaming](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m52s)

[stuff And I'm not saying that they've](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m55s)

[solved all of them but they've solved a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m56s)

[good chunk of them And so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h46m57s)

[it's we're much more likely to have a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m00s)

[good a good recording of it uh to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m02s)

[able to go through and do as well So So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m06s)

[that that much is is exciting So um but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m08s)

[the so the big thing right if the for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m14s)

[co-pilot right and let me move myself](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m18s)

[out of the way so I'm not blocking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m20s)

[because darn it I don't know what is up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m22s)

[with Visual Studio I don't know why this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m25s)

[is controversial solution explorer on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m26s)

[the left co-pilot chat on the right I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m29s)

[don't know why this is hard like this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m32s)

[the way it feels very natural but yet](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m34s)

[apparently I'm in the minority I don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m36s)

[understand why I think this is normal Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m38s)

[but the the ability to be able to go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m42s)

[through and leverage um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m44s)

[Copilot inside of Visual Studio just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m48s)

[like you could inside of VS Code is one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m50s)

[of the the big](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m53s)

[uh big changes So this uh oh you're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h47m57s)

[saying no Izzy Was that to my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m00s)

[positioning in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m02s)

[i I don't know I don't know why Like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m05s)

[this is this is the way it is meant to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m07s)

[be It feels natural I I realize it's not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m09s)

[the default and I am I am in the uh uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m12s)

[abnormality right um but having access](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m16s)

[to copilot in here you've got access to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m20s)

[uh various models of whichever one you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m24s)

[want to use again it's tied to your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m26s)

[GitHub copilot uh subscription so for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m28s)

[example](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m31s)

[um but there is a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m32s)

[like there is a get started for free I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m38s)

[don't remember exactly what it is It's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m40s)

[like 2000](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m41s)

[GitHub copilot bin solution explorer on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m43s)

[the right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m45s)

[H](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m49s)

[I I will say it is it is getting and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m50s)

[actually had a long debate with with u](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m54s)

[my boss o over it recently because my my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h48m57s)

[opinion is that like I think AI is is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m02s)

[overhyped I I I and I that that closing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m06s)

[keynote from uh Scott Hanselman](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m11s)

[uh and uh Mark uh Rkininovich I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m15s)

[probably butchering his last name I can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m18s)

[never say it properly Um I think gave a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m19s)

[very accurate picture and I realized](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m22s)

[yeah Scott and Mark uh learned to live](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m24s)

[right um I yeah keynote uh I think they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m28s)

[gave an accurate picture of the current](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m33s)

[state of where AI is at And I think it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m35s)

[is an amazing tool that developers](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m38s)

[should absolutely learn learn to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m41s)

[leverage But it's just that it is a tool](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m43s)

[like the I I I am not sold on the idea](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m47s)

[that it's going to replace developers](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m50s)

[and all of that stuff I think there are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m53s)

[times it has saved me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m55s)

[significant time and effort which is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h49m58s)

[great Like that's what a tool should do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m00s)

[Um and I think it has taken a a a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m03s)

[several classes of problems that were](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m07s)

[previously difficult to impossible and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m09s)

[made them trivial like there is a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m12s)

[cases of things that we can now do that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m16s)

[we couldn't do prior which is great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m18s)

[right like they have commod commoditized](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m21s)

[comm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m24s)

[made it a commodity I don't know the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m27s)

[right word um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m28s)

[yeah shoehorning into everything is a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m32s)

[massive problem yeah completely agree](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m34s)

[Mini 4G like I I think I think in that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m35s)

[regard it is it is a a bad solution](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m39s)

[solution right like we joke with a lot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m44s)

[of our clients that nobody needs another](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m46s)

[chatbot Like no nobody wants that Right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m48s)

[now leveraging AI to to to like looking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m51s)

[at your existing workloads and and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m56s)

[workflows and saying "Okay is there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h50m59s)

[anything in this workflow that we did](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m01s)

[because you know maybe parsing parsing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m04s)

[the intent out of a document was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m06s)

[previously hard right or extracting key](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m08s)

[bits of data from this was hard because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m12s)

[we couldn't do it in an expert systemy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m15s)

[type way like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m17s)

[examining your existing workflows to see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m20s)

[where where it might actually provide](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m21s)

[value I think that's a good use of it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m24s)

[right like we've got a system that we've](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m26s)

[been building where where it parses](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m28s)

[documents that are somewhat arbitrary](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m29s)

[but it pulls out key key values that it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m32s)

[needs from it to and then surfaces those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m35s)

[up to the user It's like great Like that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m38s)

[is it's not another chatbot It's not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m40s)

[like the user still in the loop They can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m43s)

[you know they can review the document](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m46s)

[and they can do all this stuff to double](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m47s)

[check but it saves on them having to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m48s)

[scan and try to find it right the AI has](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m50s)

[already kind of picked out and gone "Ooh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m53s)

[ooh I think this is this is this is the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m54s)

[thing right?" It's like good right make](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m57s)

[the user more efficient but don't don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h51m59s)

[just shove it everywhere And I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m01s)

[that's the thing is if it's approached](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m03s)

[that way](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m05s)

[with the human still being the key thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m07s)

[there it's not replacing developers It's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m10s)

[it's elevating developers Like I spent a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m12s)

[great deal of time putting together a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m15s)

[presentation um last week Um and there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m16s)

[was a lot of just boilerplate stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m20s)

[where I'm like h I don't want to do like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m21s)

[there I had a task where it was like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m24s)

[okay we've got all of these user stories](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m26s)

[in an Excel spreadsheet we need to get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m28s)

[these on to a nice uh nice graph and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m29s)

[grouped according to this and I'm like h](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m33s)

[I don't want to like I would have much](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m35s)

[preferred to hand that over to like M365](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m38s)

[copilot and said just do this make it so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m40s)

[right like I think that's good use of AI](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m44s)

[but a lot of the stuff that people are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m47s)

[shoehorning in is not good use of it and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m49s)

[again making people more efficient and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m53s)

[faster that'd be great like if I could](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m55s)

[have finished that presentation a little](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m57s)

[bit quicker so I could have gone back](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h52m59s)

[and spent more time coding I would have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m00s)

[been happier Like that's what I want AI](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m02s)

[to do is take the crap away from me Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m03s)

[yeah my biggest bug bear is in the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m08s)

[coding versus debugging layout uh by](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m10s)

[default are too different and a bit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m12s)

[jarring when it swaps uh midplay Oh yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m14s)

[yeah yeah The Visual Studio layout So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m17s)

[you can So I agree and I actually wish](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m19s)

[that Visual Studio didn't have different](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m23s)

[layouts for debugging versus editing I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m24s)

[wish I could tell it just have one but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m27s)

[you can change them both And I generally](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m30s)

[will change them both And I will like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m32s)

[I'll move the solution explorer over](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m34s)

[I'll hit debug It'll move back to the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m35s)

[right I'll be annoyed I'll while](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m37s)

[debugging I'll drag it back to the left](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m39s)

[and go "Haha back to normal My world is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m41s)

[complete." Cuz yes I I agree Like it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m44s)

[it's annoying Like I I get why they did](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m47s)

[it but I feel like that different layout](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m50s)

[for debugging versus editing like I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m52s)

[trying to remember when that got](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m54s)

[introduced in Visual Studio It was old](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m56s)

[It was really old because I the very](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h53m59s)

[first version of Visual Studio I ever](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m01s)

[touched was Visual Studio 2003](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m02s)

[which is I think the second or third](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m05s)

[edition of Visual Studio that was there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m08s)

[Um but like that was the first one and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m11s)

[think it existed all the way back then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m15s)

[trying to remember like it's been in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m18s)

[there for a long time and I'm I am](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m20s)

[wondering if that it's it's things like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m24s)

[that where it's like I would love to see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m26s)

[them revisit some of like those old](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m28s)

[assumptions and say is that still is the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m30s)

[is the reasons we did this still valid](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m33s)

[or not right or are we just doing it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m35s)

[because that's what we did before so but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m39s)

[yes I will say I I do think Copilot is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m42s)

[very useful ful and can be very helpful](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m45s)

[for certain tasks and having AI work on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m49s)

[a task like they demoed assigning um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m53s)

[bugs to co-pilot which was cool right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h54m57s)

[like it it like it's nice that you can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m01s)

[go and assign tasks](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m03s)

[I do question](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m06s)

[because in their demo they had these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m08s)

[well-written tickets now some of us are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m10s)

[fortunate enough to work with you know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m14s)

[PMs that write well-written tickets](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m16s)

[Based on my experience I think that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m19s)

[maybe about half the companies in the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m21s)

[world have well-written tickets And it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m24s)

[only because they have some PM who does](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m26s)

[a really good job that like that that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m29s)

[usually the the make or break it right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m32s)

[you got a PM that knows how to write a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m34s)

[will a really good ticket They've got](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m36s)

[enough tech knowledge to write it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m38s)

[correctly technically speaking right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m40s)

[because that's the thing is I think the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m42s)

[idea that you can assign a ticket to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m44s)

[co-pilot to work on assumes that there's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m46s)

[enough information in the ticket for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m48s)

[co-pilot to be able to do the right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m50s)

[thing right and I don't know that that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m51s)

[always true Like some tickets absolutely](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m54s)

[like that I there's been several](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m58s)

[projects I've worked on where the PM](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h55m59s)

[would file tickets of oh I want this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m01s)

[text changed over here right those are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m03s)

[the types of bugs I would love to just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m05s)

[feed to the AI and say yeah I trust the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m07s)

[AI to go change the text on a button](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m09s)

[That's fine right even localized it can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m11s)

[probably figure itself out Like it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m14s)

[should be okay right maybe not But you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m16s)

[know we'll review the PR after after it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m19s)

[does its work rather than you know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m21s)

[worrying about it up front That's fine](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m22s)

[But I I do question how valuable that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m26s)

[will be because it assumes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m28s)

[yeah my PMs have not got a clue and are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m31s)

[more able to organize the pub visit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m35s)

[regardless of success](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m37s)

[Yeah And that's that And that was the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m39s)

[thing that got me thinking when when](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m41s)

[they demoed it is like this is a cool](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m42s)

[demo and it demos really slick like like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m45s)

[the demo they set up So if anybody wants](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m49s)

[to see it go watch uh Satia's keynote](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m51s)

[presentation Um and the because Satia](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m55s)

[comes out and I'm trying to remember the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h56m59s)

[lady that came out after him Um but like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m01s)

[watch the whole thing end to end because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m03s)

[they cuz they they do it kind of in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m05s)

[parts Um but it it made for a sick demo](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m07s)

[Like it was an awesome demo don't get me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m12s)

[wrong but it did get me thinking of like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m15s)

[practically where would I deploy this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m18s)

[when would I leverage this as my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m20s)

[solution would this be something that I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m22s)

[would go through and do and I just don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m24s)

[know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m26s)

[I don't know how many places I have I I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m28s)

[think maybe about half](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m32s)

[would I trust the the PM's description](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m34s)

[for the AI right like the because the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m38s)

[running joke I I think for for people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m40s)

[for a while has been you know AI won't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m42s)

[take our jobs until people can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m44s)

[accurately describe what it is that they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m46s)

[want right like that it's like yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m48s)

[garbage in garbage out Like the AI can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m52s)

[kind of smooth over some rough edges but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m55s)

[but if you tell it to go right when what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m57s)

[you actually needed was left like I I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h57m59s)

[don't see it solving those types of pro](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m03s)

[like it's got enough trouble just trying](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m06s)

[to do the right thing once it's got](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m08s)

[enough information I like it's not going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m09s)

[to it's not going to 180 on you to land](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m12s)

[in the right thing Like it might it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m16s)

[might 180 when you don't want it to but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m17s)

[I highly doubt it 180s and lands on the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m20s)

[correct answer ever like that's that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m22s)

[not really plausible](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m24s)

[So So yeah So with that said that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m28s)

[co-pilot boot camp I I think that was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m31s)

[that's one of the key things that like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m34s)

[I think this is something that people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m38s)

[absolutely should learn how to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m40s)

[because this is an awesome new tool that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m42s)

[can greatly improve your life](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m45s)

[But I but I think that's as far as I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m48s)

[willing to go at Now admittedly that's a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m50s)

[pretty big statement right brand new](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m53s)

[development tool like this this is like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h58m56s)

[better than like some new IDE stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m02s)

[right like this is a big deal being able](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m05s)

[to have this kind of this kind of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m07s)

[insight and information Um and in the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m09s)

[really happy cases being able to task it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m13s)

[and say "Yeah go convert my YAML to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m15s)

[DevOps because I don't want to think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m18s)

[about this too hard right like I've](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m20s)

[already figured out the hard stuff Just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m22s)

[change the syntax for me." Right i don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m24s)

[want to go look up you know what's the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m26s)

[right syntax for this in DevOps Just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m28s)

[make it happen right and it did a really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m30s)

[shockingly good job I was a little](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m33s)

[disappointed it flattened because I had](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m35s)

[I had done all my new lines to to line](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m38s)

[things up properly and it removed those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m40s)

[and got them all in one line I'm like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m42s)

["Dang Nabbit." And I had to go put my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m43s)

[CLI commands back because you know an a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m45s)

[command that has like 30 parameters I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m47s)

[don't want that on one line I'd like to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m50s)

[break that up so I can actually read it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m51s)

[like a human Um AI couldn't care less](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m53s)

[about what I want and then proceeded to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m56s)

[flatten it And I'm like "Dang Nabbit."](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=00h59m58s)

[So I put it back But again it got most](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m00s)

[of the way there It did a good job And I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m02s)

[was like well that's good But yes there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m06s)

[is a free GitHub co-pilot And so this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m08s)

[going to be for that talk what what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m10s)

[people are going to be if people want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m13s)

[follow along they are going to ex be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m16s)

[expected to have their own GitHub](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m18s)

[copilot account whether that be a free](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m20s)

[one or a paid one My fear is that people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m23s)

[will have a free one and have like prior](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m25s)

[burn through too many tokens to get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m28s)

[through everything That's my fear So if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m30s)

[you're watching this and you're you're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m33s)

[planning on coming don't sign up for a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m34s)

[free account and then go burn all your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m36s)

[tokens Uh would I want a DevOps YAML a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m38s)

[do API at zero](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m42s)

[h](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m46s)

[what would So would do API just invoke](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m48s)

[API because I will say if it's an Azure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m51s)

[API you can get away with it with the um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m54s)

[the AZ REST stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h00m57s)

[If it's not an Azure one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m00s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m04s)

[oh ASDO API Oh got it Right Azure DevOps](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m05s)

[API Yeah Well one the Azure DevOps API](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m10s)

[is kind of a pain in the butt to use](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m12s)

[We're doing a bunch of migrations for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m14s)

[people right now and working with the a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m15s)

[lot of it A a lot of it calling its own](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m18s)

[APIs Yeah As in call its own APIs Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m22s)

[And you can do some of those because we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m26s)

[actually have Azure DevOps pipelines to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m28s)

[migrate people's Azure DevOps whether](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m32s)

[that be Azure DevOps to Azure DevOps](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m34s)

[because sometimes people are just you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m35s)

[know moving from one instance to another](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m37s)

[or sometimes they're moving to GitHub or](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m39s)

[they're coming from GitHub or whatever](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m40s)

[what have you Like we do a lot of those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m42s)

[kind of migration things for people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m43s)

[because it's a pain in the butt to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m45s)

[well I will say that it is a pain in the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m47s)

[butt especially if somebody says I want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m49s)

[all the history like that's really if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m52s)

[they just say I want the data overcross](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m54s)

[that's a lot easier than I want the data](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m56s)

[with all the change history that makes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h01m58s)

[it a lot harder that makes it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m00s)

[significantly harder](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m02s)

[but yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m04s)

[so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m07s)

[yeah this yeah this is the demo that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m09s)

[they did delegate like a boss you know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m11s)

[But](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m15s)

[I wonder I wonder do I have it do I have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m18s)

[it enabled for like the material design](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m20s)

[project can I go and do this right now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m22s)

[can I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m25s)

[Can I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m27s)

[No I don't have it set up I was going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m30s)

[say I I think you have to have an org](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m32s)

[thing with it with it enabled](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m33s)

[See I have a load of scripts in order to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m37s)

[get correct build number and versions](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m39s)

[from builds matched on GitHub branches](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m41s)

[Yeah I think that's that's fairly common](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m43s)

[for a lot of people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m45s)

[I need to look this up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m48s)

[This is assign myself Let's put I want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m55s)

[to I want to look this Okay so couple](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h02m59s)

[things I was gone PR stacked up Things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m02s)

[in progress](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m06s)

[Um and I wanted I'm I'm annoyed that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m07s)

[this one's still outstanding but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m10s)

[let's see Uh let's let's go through and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m13s)

[get some of these things done This we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m16s)

[can do right like here's something I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m19s)

[want GitHub to do I want GitHub](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m22s)

[Copilot to review PRs So I don't need](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m26s)

[this button anymore Like I think for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m29s)

[like for this open source project the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m32s)

[risky things that I have in here is I do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m35s)

[have a PAT in the pipeline as a secret](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m38s)

[that has the ability to push to the repo](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m43s)

[It can't deploy but it can push](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m46s)

[And the the the only reason I turn this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m49s)

[on is because without it in theory](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m53s)

[somebody could xfill that secret right i](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m55s)

[basically I turn this on and I go in and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h03m58s)

[check and I make sure yep not trying to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m01s)

[xfill a secret Good Approve workflows to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m03s)

[run Right That's the whole that's the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m06s)

[entire check that I'm making And I wish](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m09s)

[like I would be even okay if co-pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m12s)

[like even if I just had the controls to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m16s)

[say you know what if this thing isn't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m18s)

[touching the pipelines or anything](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m20s)

[related to them it's probably not trying](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m21s)

[to xfill a pipeline secret Like there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m24s)

[are other ways they could do it right it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m26s)

[doesn't have to be in the YAML because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m28s)

[in theory if it got put into an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m30s)

[environment variable you could write](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m31s)

[some code in a test and Xfill it there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m33s)

[Like there's other ways you could do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m34s)

[right like there are ways to Xfill the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m36s)

[secrets](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m38s)

[and we would not want somebody to Xfill](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m40s)

[the secret because you know they'd have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m42s)

[push permission to the repo and then I'd](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m43s)

[have to go regen the pat That'd be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m45s)

[annoying right so that's the whole](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m46s)

[reason for that button I want Copilot to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m49s)

[flag those Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m51s)

[yeah And that the the issue the issue I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m55s)

[ran into is the on GitHub they they run](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h04m58s)

[the the token that the the actions run](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m03s)

[with Um you control at the repo level](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m06s)

[whether it has read or write and by](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m10s)

[default it only has read permissions and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m11s)

[you can grant it write permissions That](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m13s)

[is a that is a that is an option as well](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m15s)

[But any action uh while an action is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m18s)

[running if the user is the generated](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m22s)

[system token the actions that you are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m26s)

[running will not trigger downstream](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m29s)

[actions right without explicit calls and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m31s)

[whatnot And so in in some of the cases I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m33s)

[was wanting like for example when it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m37s)

[pushes the the icon updates right I want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m38s)

[it to open the PR and I want the active](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m42s)

[it opening the PR to trigger the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m45s)

[automation to run the builds to then set](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m47s)

[automerge to let it complete right which](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m50s)

[is great that's what I wanted and the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m53s)

[easiest way I found to do it is just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m55s)

[genad](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m56s)

[so that the the user that's opening the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h05m58s)

[PR is my system is my you know service](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m01s)

[account effectively](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m04s)

[so that it will autocomplete the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m06s)

[autocomplete will trigger the the build](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m08s)

[and tests so that the autocomplete meets](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m11s)

[its check so that it can complete all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m13s)

[the way through](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m15s)

[So okay what was this thing actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m17s)

[doing set the vertical uh is there is no](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m20s)

[effect when](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m23s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m25s)

[since the vertical alignment of part](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m27s)

[toggle is center there is no effect when](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m29s)

[setting uh vertical alignment](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m33s)

[Oh right because this thing has a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m40s)

[vertical alignment of center](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m42s)

[the content al it means the content](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m45s)

[alignment is always going to be there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m47s)

[There's no way to align the content say](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m49s)

[right or left](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m50s)

[Got it Good catch](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m52s)

[That is a good catch Put this in labels](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h06m57s)

[That's That's a bug fix It looks like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m02s)

[enable automerge Confirm automerge](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m04s)

[Got an approval Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m08s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m11s)

[Code inspection shows some errors](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m14s)

[regarding design instance in the demo](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m15s)

[apps this PR Oh sweet sweet sweet sweet](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m17s)

[sweet sweet](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m20s)

[Yeah So this was almost assuredly when](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m24s)

[we converted over to a shared project](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m27s)

[and this is just design time issues So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m30s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m33s)

[So we're going to approve this and this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m40s)

[is going to be yet another one here So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m42s)

[let's see This is going to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m44s)

[demo app and that's probably good enough](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m47s)

[Throw it in the milestone](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m51s)

[approve and run](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m53s)

[and then enable auto merge Enable auto](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m56s)

[merge Boom boom boom Bippity bop booya](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h07m57s)

[Rock and roll](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m00s)

[Uh dark mode not working anymore What](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m02s)

[oh let's Okay so one Jorus is very good](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m08s)

[And so if he says it's not working the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m15s)

[demo app dark mode is not applied](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m18s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m20s)

[UI stays in dark mode](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m24s)

[Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m27s)

[I screwed this one up This is Oh I bet](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m32s)

[you I I bet you already know what the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m35s)

[fix is This This This was my fault](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m36s)

[This was my fault I bet you it's a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m40s)

[deletion of a line Yep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m43s)

[Yep This was This was me screwing this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m47s)

[up because Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep I did](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m51s)

[this I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m54s)

[Yep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h08m57s)

[Okay this is one of those areas where I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m08s)

[kind of want to put in a a ZAML test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m10s)

[against the demo app just to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m13s)

[just to fix this So let's see This was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m17s)

[demo app Slap this in the milestone We](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m19s)

[may kick this milestone loose because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m22s)

[this has got a lot of stuff in it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m24s)

[Getting big fast](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m27s)

[Okay Add template binding padding](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m31s)

[Let's see here Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m35s)

[so pulls the padding up Template binding](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m40s)

[it down there Template binding it there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m43s)

[Pulls it up to the center Let me just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m45s)

[make sure that these go inside of it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m47s)

[Like this is a beautiful example of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m51s)

[it's one of those you want your custom](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m54s)

[styles to be as configurable as possible](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m56s)

[but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h09m59s)

[like I think sometimes people forget](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m01s)

[that sometimes things just straight](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m02s)

[hardcoded and rightfully should be right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m04s)

[but things like padding yeah it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m08s)

[probably something that we want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m10s)

[enable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m11s)

[because if a control has a padding](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m12s)

[property on it like this chip if this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m15s)

[padding property isn't consumed anywhere](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m17s)

[in the template with that template](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m19s)

[binding setting it has no effect which](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m21s)

[is exactly the use case we have here I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m23s)

[just want to make sure of where this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m26s)

[going into So this is outline chip I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m28s)

[think that's fine I don't think there's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m31s)

[any more below this I think yeah that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m32s)

[the end of them Okay I thought that was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m36s)

[all of them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m37s)

[This is great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m39s)

[Okay So that goes there That goes there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m43s)

[And this is a this feels more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m46s)

[enhancementy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m49s)

[Um and I'm going to actually flag that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m51s)

[as a release note item](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m53s)

[because that feels like the type of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m56s)

[thing that has bitten other people in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h10m58s)

[the past](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m00s)

[Legend how are we doing welcome to the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m03s)

[stream](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m06s)

[Good to have you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m08s)

[Okay Tree list view selected items](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m11s)

[That's the one that we looked over](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m13s)

[before That thing's merging](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m14s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m19s)

[Uh let's see This guy needs to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m22s)

[rebased and done So we're going to go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m25s)

[through and let's take care of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m27s)

[T-Unit thing and hopefully put this down](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m29s)

[Okay So let's let's get my master](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m32s)

[updated](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m34s)

[Okay And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m36s)

[uh where's my local branches i think I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m40s)

[have a boy Vay I got to clean up my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m43s)

[local branches I got way too many local](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m45s)

[branches](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m48s)

[Uh yeah So let's go here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m50s)

[and then we'll rebase it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m54s)

[And why is my nightbot so aggressive](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h11m59s)

[can get that guy turned off because it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m08s)

[is it I feel like it has been more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m10s)

[problematic than helpful tonight Yeah I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m12s)

[Um here let's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m33s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m36s)

[there So we'll there that should](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m40s)

[Where is the button](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m44s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m51s)

[Where's the button to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h12m56s)

[maybe I'm just an idiot Uh well that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m05s)

[should turn it all the way off Okay Well](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m07s)

[there That I think is going to uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m10s)

[coal branches Yeah that is exactly what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m14s)

[we need here I um I have a few too many](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m17s)

[I have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m20s)

[way too many Uh but let's let's get this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m22s)

[guy cuz we need him We've got a conflict](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m25s)

[mostly because I've touched every test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m29s)

[file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m31s)

[So let's see here We probably just want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m35s)

[to take the master side of the fence](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m38s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m41s)

[well we definitely need this line](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m46s)

[regardless of what the other ones do Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m49s)

[I think what I can do though is let's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m52s)

[just do Oh did those in the wrong order](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m55s)

[Let's back this out Let's take this side](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h13m59s)

[of the fence But then let's come down](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m01s)

[here since we know that it's just going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m04s)

[to be arguments and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m05s)

[fix this Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m08s)

[on the right Wait a minute Why is it not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m11s)

[doing the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m13s)

[Oh there's a bug there There's a bug](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m15s)

[there Hold on Let's back out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m18s)

[There's a bug there The multi-cursor](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m24s)

[support does not work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m26s)

[That is um I will file that bug with get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m31s)

[kraken in a moment There we go See now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m36s)

[the emotes are working better I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m38s)

[apologize for that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m40s)

[I think I took all of the defaults when](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m44s)

[I set up the Nightbot stuff and it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m46s)

[probably a good example of the defaults](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m49s)

[not being uh appropriate Let's see So we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m50s)

[want the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m54s)

[So once again I want this but I want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h14m58s)

[await them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m01s)

[because assert equal](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m05s)

[expected value get value That's probably](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m08s)

[better Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m10s)

[continue the rebase](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m13s)

[What did I do here uh let's see here So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m17s)

[we want this side of the fence](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m21s)

[No we want to assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m27s)

[Yeah So that's the that's the change](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m33s)

[Okay So I clearly one of those commits](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m36s)

[was partway through my rejax find and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m39s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m41s)

[There we are Okay So wake up Wake up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m43s)

[Visual Studio It's time It's time for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m46s)

[you to go to work Time for you to go to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m48s)

[work Let's start with this Do we compile](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m51s)

[the very first test is the compiler](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m54s)

[happy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h15m57s)

[i can go on the left now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m02s)

[Go go go Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m07s)

[Visual Studio noises](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m10s)

[You know that's something that they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m13s)

[haven't had in Visual Studio There used](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m15s)

[to be sound effects in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m17s)

[There used to be sounds for some of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m20s)

[these things And then at one point in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m21s)

[time they teased out something that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m24s)

[would do a u like a build failure or](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m26s)

[similar JC welcome welcome welcome](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m30s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m35s)

[so we're going to fix these up cuz these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m37s)

[are probably all just tests that have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m40s)

[been written assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m43s)

[uh is equal to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m49s)

[bananas](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m53s)

[assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h16m56s)

[is equal to bananas There we go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m02s)

[What's your problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m06s)

[oh this is not an a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m08s)

[this is not a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m13s)

[a asynchronous thing but Oh sweet This](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m17s)

[thing just converted properly Oh I love](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m20s)

[it I love it I love it I love it I love](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m22s)

[it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m24s)

[Okay So that that worked out there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m26s)

[Then at some point we're going to run](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m30s)

[all these tests I actually I I converted](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m31s)

[a a project over earlier today uh in my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m33s)

[day job to using](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m37s)

[uh MTP so Microsoft testing platform Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m40s)

[because my colleagues were probably like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m43s)

["What is MTP?"](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m45s)

[because you know all of the uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m47s)

[excitement around MCP and Microsoft](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m50s)

[figured MTP wouldn't confuse anybody](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m53s)

[It's like I ve guys](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h17m56s)

[you are going to make yourself hard Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m00s)

[yeah but I I did not convert them to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m03s)

[Tunit because that would have been that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m06s)

[would have probably been a bridge too](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m09s)

[far Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m10s)

[but getting them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m14s)

[I teleporter](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m16s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m19s)

[Like I will say though T unit I think is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m21s)

[my new favorite testing framework I if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m24s)

[we get time I want to go through and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m26s)

[convert over my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m29s)

[myn net templates I may I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m32s)

[decide that like all of my .NET](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m35s)

[templates I'm going to add MTP2 because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m37s)

[there's no reason not to just turn it on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m39s)

[for all your test projects The only](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m41s)

[disadvantage](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m43s)

[like for new projects absolutely turn it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m45s)

[on from the beginning go If you have an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m47s)

[existing project you depending on what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m49s)

[your uh test framework is you may have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m52s)

[to do a little bit of work like XUnit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m55s)

[you can't be on XUnit V2 you have to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m57s)

[on XUnit V3 So there like dep if you've](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h18m59s)

[got a big investment elsewhere it may](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m02s)

[not be a trivial switch but a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m04s)

[them it's rev the package turn the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m06s)

[properties on let's see got a pack](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m08s)

[question for you sweet after recent](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m10s)

[update the locator uh param to update](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m12s)

[manager can't be null uh which shows the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m14s)

[problem if you update pack to latest](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m18s)

[what changes should be made uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m20s)

[uh no in this case legend uh Nikolai is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m24s)

[one of my other maintainers so this link](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m28s)

[I trust because I recognize his GitHub](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m29s)

[ID Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m31s)

[So yes this was an intentional change](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m37s)

[that got made So my partner Kayn and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m39s)

[were discussing the issues with Velopac](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m42s)

[and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m45s)

[we had some debate There was a long](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m47s)

[debate Um and it it came down to Eye](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m49s)

[Loger was a a big motivator behind it My](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m52s)

[opinion logger is simple and trivial](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m55s)

[However I am not your average developer](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h19m59s)

[and the uh there was a big debate about](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m02s)

[how to expose logging and we kept](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m05s)

[getting bug reports from people who](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m07s)

[couldn't get the logging right and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m09s)

[couldn't give good error logs when](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m11s)

[things went wrong And so we eventually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m14s)

[decided you know what we are going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m18s)

[fix the problem of not getting good logs](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m20s)

[when things go wrong And so now there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m23s)

[a single log So the the big change and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m26s)

[the driving factor behind this is now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m29s)

[there is a single log file If something](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m30s)

[goes wrong if you provide the log file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m33s)

[we can usually say exactly what went](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m35s)

[wrong and why That's the goal Now we may](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m37s)

[still miss a log statement here or there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m40s)

[or whatnot but that was the end goal And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m41s)

[it was like but we had to scrap Eye](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m43s)

[Loger to make that happen And so it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m45s)

[like I didn't like it because I like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m47s)

[eyeloger and I think it's trivial but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m49s)

[other people didn't and couldn't and we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m51s)

[kept getting bad bug reports So anyway](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m54s)

[that was the motivation behind the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m57s)

[change Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h20m58s)

[okay So let's see Check for update async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m01s)

[Uh check for default Velopac locator](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m07s)

[update manager and the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m10s)

[let's see here After recent update the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m14s)

[locator parameter update manager can't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m16s)

[be null](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m18s)

[Yes Well hold on So just to be clear let](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m20s)

[me Is this the right repo yeah this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m24s)

[the right repo Uh scrap this I'm on a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m27s)

[detached head Uh yeah shut up Uh I want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m30s)

[to check out this commit Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m35s)

[right So this uh let's see check out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m42s)

[this commit I guess I could have just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m45s)

[jumped to master too So I assume](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m47s)

[uh what would be the effect on the local](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m50s)

[tree population i know Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m53s)

[JC uh can you just confirm uh 1251 is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h21m58s)

[that the release that you're referring](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m02s)

[to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m03s)

[that's that's the latest one we kicked](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m05s)

[out So I assume that's the right one but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m07s)

[I just want to make sure I'm actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m09s)

[looking at the the version that matters](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m10s)

[to you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m12s)

[um cuz I I may challenge part of that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m14s)

[assertion](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m17s)

[But let me let me jump in here real](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m21s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m23s)

[Update manager I'm I've actually been in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m25s)

[the process of writing Okay perfect I've](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m27s)

[been in the process of writing docs So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m29s)

[if you if you troll the the docs repo](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m32s)

[you will you'll see some some samples of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m35s)

[forthcoming stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m39s)

[So I I've just been quietly pushing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m41s)

[branches and just not saying anything](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m44s)

[It's been great Uh okay So the the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m46s)

[locator](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m52s)

[should be nullable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m55s)

[like so you should be able to pass null](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h22m59s)

[in Now you're going to end up with this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m01s)

[velopaclocator.curren](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m04s)

[Um and this guy so the there is there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m06s)

[the potential that there that there's a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m11s)

[bug here because there was a discussion](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m12s)

[on Discord](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m14s)

[um of somebody who was calling out a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m16s)

[potential problem but we were waiting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m19s)

[for more information because we can't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m20s)

[reproduce the issue and we think there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m23s)

[might be a bug in their app code This is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m26s)

[one of the drawbacks because Velopac](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m28s)

[puts the update flow in your hands It](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m29s)

[means sometimes we get bug reports and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m32s)

[the problem is somebody's usage of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m33s)

[library not the library itself So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m35s)

[another reason why we like that log file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m37s)

[Um but Velopac app build is expected to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m40s)

[set this current right so it's expected](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m44s)

[to get through here If you end up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m47s)

[calling something like create default](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m49s)

[for platform and you call this before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m50s)

[your call to Velopac app build which is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m53s)

[something that should happen as early in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m55s)

[main as possible](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m57s)

[So you shouldn't be calling this before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h23m59s)

[this but I've seen people do weird](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m01s)

[things Um that's one possibility but you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m03s)

[So if you've done Velopac app build](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m08s)

[early in Maine you should be able to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m11s)

[pass a null here unless there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m13s)

[let me just check Um and it should just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m18s)

[give you a default locator based upon](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m21s)

[your platform That should be the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m24s)

[expectation that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m26s)

[uh inside of here that current gets set](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m29s)

[and current gets set because of an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m33s)

[invocation that looks like this which](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m36s)

[should be tied to whichever platform](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m38s)

[you're on should give you one of these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m39s)

[locators which should find the right app](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m42s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m45s)

[Failing test four days ago Oh man you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m47s)

[guys got tests and everything](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m49s)

[Let's see Four days ago Last week Last](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h24m57s)

[week So it must be this one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m00s)

[What's going on what is going on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m03s)

[um okay Sorry I got to back this up I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m07s)

[can't see the log file like this Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m10s)

[folks settings](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m15s)

[updator get current Air test failed Well](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m19s)

[look at that That certainly looks like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m21s)

[it Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m23s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m26s)

[Uh detour time Detour time Code Copy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m28s)

[Clone](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m35s)

[Paste](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m37s)

[Open repo Let's just go Let's just go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m43s)

[look at this then real quick Let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m46s)

[This guy was which branch one of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m49s)

[dependabot ones Dependabot Nougat](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m52s)

[Uh BF84](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m55s)

[The remote Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h25m59s)

[Uh remote branch doesn't exist Did it um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m04s)

[the tour time yeah exactly Uh JC did](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m09s)

[this thing already merge or did it or](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m12s)

[did it just not merge i'm trying to look](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m15s)

[to see if I see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m17s)

[uh Oh yes BF84 This one here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m19s)

[Interesting Well then it looks like main](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m26s)

[might be good enough So let's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m28s)

[uh I amended branch Got it Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m31s)

[I'm going to pop main then And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m37s)

[see here I think I've opened this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m41s)

[project before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m44s)

[Uh just update Velopac to fail Got it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m51s)

[Well that sounds like an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m54s)

[that sounds like an easy test here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m57s)

[because there there is going to be an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h26m59s)

[updated release uh coming shortly Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m00s)

[dang](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m03s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m07s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m33s)

[Okay sorry about that Okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m38s)

[here Updates](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m41s)

[run pack update](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m45s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h27m56s)

[Okay And then you is there any reason I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m04s)

[can't just blind run all the tests](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m08s)

[are these are they fairly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m11s)

[none okay cool Uh build succeeded DB](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m32s)

[test utils That is not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m37s)

[Come on Find all the tests There we go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m40s)

[There we go This one looks like what I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m44s)

[want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m46s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m49s)

[Settings View model](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m51s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h28m55s)

[okay No Villa pack locator has been set](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m05s)

[Okay there we go So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m08s)

[oh that's why this is failing Oh that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m12s)

[interesting Okay so you're right There](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m15s)

[is a behavioral change](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m17s)

[there is a behavioral change because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m21s)

[before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m23s)

[this works at runtime](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m26s)

[because I'm guessing if I go and look](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m29s)

[you've got a an overloaded main because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m30s)

[this looks very similar to my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m32s)

[template right develop back okay so at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m36s)

[runtime this call will set up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m39s)

[that property but inside of the test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m43s)

[nothing has called to set that up ah so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m45s)

[in this case I I think then what we need](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m49s)

[is there is a how do you do this how do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m52s)

[you do this nicely so Velipac has a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h29m56s)

[uh was it a test locator what do we call](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m01s)

[it test Velopac locator So there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m03s)

[there is a in the locators namespace](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m06s)

[there is an implementation in there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m08s)

[that's specifically there for the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m10s)

[purposes of unit testing so that you can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m13s)

[kind of prepopulate in whatever you want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m16s)

[uh and have it work right that's the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m19s)

[that's the purpose of this guy because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m21s)

[we figured people were going to end up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m23s)

[writing this implementation themsel](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m25s)

[anyway if we didn't give it to them so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m27s)

[we just we gave one in right so there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m29s)

[a test valipac locator in there so I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m31s)

[think what you are looking to do then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m34s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m38s)

[is switch out and leverage that I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m41s)

[trying to look and see where this uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m43s)

[this is just looking at a network drive](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m47s)

[for the update](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m50s)

[application](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h30m54s)

[Yeah because in here what you what you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m02s)

[actually want to do is on the test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m04s)

[projects you want to do uh you know new](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m06s)

[test develop pack locator right and this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m10s)

[this gets around um and obviously then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m13s)

[we have to populate this guy's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m18s)

[constructor because he he takes in some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m19s)

[stuff right of doing the needful and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m21s)

[whatnot All right So um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m25s)

[because if I do that I assume this now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m30s)

[gets me past the failure But you are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m34s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m38s)

[Oh yeah Shut up It's unhappy Not a valid](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m39s)

[version string But I am wondering if the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m43s)

[issue is this line right here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m46s)

[Because as the old saying goes new is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m50s)

[glue](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m53s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h31m55s)

[I'm really tempted to tell you to push](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m03s)

[your update manager and let your DI](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m05s)

[container handle it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m07s)

[because what do we got here right this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m10s)

[is this is my template So it should have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m12s)

[something down here where it's actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m14s)

[setting up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m19s)

[uh configure application services I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m22s)

[assume all your DI stuff is here There](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m24s)

[we are Lovely This is a very well](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m27s)

[organized app by the way JC Nicely done](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m30s)

[Um let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m33s)

[DB singletons and we've got all this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m36s)

[stuff registered I'm kind of I I'm like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m38s)

[this isn't a full solution here but here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m42s)

[I'm just going to write out what I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m44s)

[thinking right um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m45s)

[actually I guess I guess for feature](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m51s)

[parody singleton's wrong like add](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m53s)

[transient right um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h32m56s)

[transient](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m00s)

[update manager right because I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m02s)

[I'm kind of tempted to tell you to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m06s)

[this of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m07s)

[just push the update manager out And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m10s)

[part of the reason for doing that is if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m13s)

[update manager were here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m15s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m18s)

[yeah thank you Copied you in general I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m20s)

[will say it's made it very easy for me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m23s)

[to navigate your application Uh partly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m25s)

[because you know it looks it looks like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m27s)

[what I would expect right because if we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m30s)

[the the problem being is you're going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m32s)

[want a different locator for your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m34s)

[running app than your tests right you're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m36s)

[going to want those to be separate And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m38s)

[by so no matter what value you put here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m41s)

[is either going to be wrong for your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m43s)

[tests or wrong for your app And before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m45s)

[it it wasn't validating this thing on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m49s)

[the constructor](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m51s)

[At least I don't think it was So I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m54s)

[tempted to tell you to do something more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m56s)

[like this So return new update manager](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h33m58s)

[right and then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m01s)

[uh let's just grab this sucker here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m03s)

[right because this works at runtime just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m06s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m10s)

[right and then I would I would go as far](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m12s)

[let's see are you using release URL](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m15s)

[anywhere else private](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m17s)

[Nope That's the only usage of it So I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m21s)

[going to take this guy and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m23s)

[put him over here too Right So if that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m25s)

[goes there this goes here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m28s)

[Right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m32s)

[So that that sets up update manager to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m34s)

[be in your DI container I did it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m37s)

[transient It may not need to be but at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m38s)

[least then it matches the the because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m41s)

[right now you were creating a new](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m43s)

[instance of it every time you create a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m45s)

[settings view model This way it'll only](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m46s)

[be created uh once every time it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m48s)

[needed which is every time it's doing a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m50s)

[settings view model right we can take](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m52s)

[the co-pilot suggestion there We can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m54s)

[probably put it up here to match the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m56s)

[others And then we no longer need this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h34m58s)

[Right This guy is I assume squawking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m00s)

[about read only There we go Right So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m03s)

[this this gets you around there Now what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m06s)

[it's not going to do is it's not going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m08s)

[to fix this should fix running the app](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m10s)

[but it won't fix uh let's see And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m14s)

[we don't need clean up the using there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m17s)

[Don't worry I I will I will send this to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m20s)

[you JC here in just a second when we're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m21s)

[done That way you can that way you can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m23s)

[have it as well Right But then in here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m25s)

[what what's going to end up breaking is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m28s)

[this is no longer going to to resolve](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m30s)

[because well or will it because Autocker](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m32s)

[is going to try but it hasn't been given](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m35s)

[anything to know what to to do on this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m39s)

[because what you're going to end up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m44s)

[wanting to have here is something like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m45s)

[mocker use](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m48s)

[new update manager](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m51s)

[Update manager right and then this guy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m54s)

[is going to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h35m58s)

[fake path right and then you can do uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m00s)

[locator](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m07s)

[gets new test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m09s)

[uh oh no test velopac locator right and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m13s)

[then this guy wants a valid version So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m16s)

[so my app right we're just doing this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m18s)

[for proof of concept 1.1 or 1.0.0](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m21s)

[Right And then packages dur packages I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m26s)

[wonder why packages dur is a required](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m30s)

[parameter That feels like something we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m31s)

[should be able to default Okay I might](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m33s)

[look at that But now this I expect to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m35s)

[actually work Hey Ari nice to see you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m38s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m43s)

[I I because I I think something like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m45s)

[this is is what I would tell you to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m47s)

[But you do raise an interesting concern](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m50s)

[I was unaware of the behavior change cuz](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m51s)

[I like I knew that we the the locator](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m55s)

[change was very much intentional The](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h36m58s)

[change in behavior with the constructor](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m00s)

[was like we obviously knew we were doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m02s)

[it but I didn't think I I I fully unders](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m06s)

[I didn't gro the ramifications of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m09s)

[said change](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m10s)

[But I think something like this is more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m14s)

[akin to what you want to do because now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m15s)

[the the update manager um is in your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m19s)

[control The test fellow pack locator is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m23s)

[in your control and you can now populate](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m25s)

[this in because autocker is dumb right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m29s)

[it doesn't think for itself](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m32s)

[Um it just goes through and does](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m39s)

[type matching unless you do it otherwise](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m41s)

[I am realizing though I could go one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m44s)

[step further](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m47s)

[Is it worth adding in a No I was going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m52s)

[to say because auto mocker does come](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m56s)

[with um behaviors or uh not mock](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h37m58s)

[behaviors resolvers](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m01s)

[and a resolver is just a magical](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m04s)

[callback that you can use So if you find](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m06s)

[yourself doing something like this a lot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m08s)

[I oftentimes will write myself a custom](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m11s)

[resolver and have the resolver do the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m13s)

[needful right like if I've got a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m16s)

[particular behavior it's like yes I did](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m17s)

[a I did a custom DI registration that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m19s)

[kind of fancy in my main app and I want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m22s)

[my test to do something different I'll](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m24s)

[sometimes just shove that into a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m27s)

[resolver and then add that in to my to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m28s)

[my automocker](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m31s)

[um as a a workaround for this But yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m32s)

[Um okay You wanted a PR so let's uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m37s)

[let's fix that real quick because I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m44s)

[didn't fork I just cloned from a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m46s)

[straight um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m48s)

[I clone I I just cloned straight from](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m50s)

[GitHub But we can we can we can do this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m53s)

[So if I go fork](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m56s)

[and create fork](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h38m59s)

[This should only take a few seconds I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m05s)

[don't believe you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m06s)

[There we go And then all I need to do is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m09s)

[add a remote Oh look at that Oh look at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m11s)

[you Look at you go Get cracking Look at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m15s)

[you go Look at you go Okay then we'll](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m17s)

[make a new branch We'll do something](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m19s)

[like uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m21s)

[packac fix](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m24s)

[All right So we'll do this Just going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m26s)

[double check to make sure I did it So I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m28s)

[obviously haven't changed all of the the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m30s)

[things yet but um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h39m32s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m20s)

[where class is class](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m22s)

[here So I think this is actually so I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m37s)

[think the issue here is this is just the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m40s)

[wrong generic](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m42s)

[Uh it just needs to know the class that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m44s)

[contains the method not the return type](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m47s)

[from the method Okay I have a sinking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h41m49s)

[and xunit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h48m51s)

[I think the issue is that this still](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h48m59s)

[exists here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m01s)

[but that's a bad error message](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m04s)

[I think it's just confused because it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m08s)

[This was probably supposed to be T unit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m23s)

[Oh and it had it had to guess](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m26s)

[have been](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m32s)

[Um so this was probably supposed to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m34s)

[Tunit instead](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m36s)

[not XUnit Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h49m38s)

[further I should maybe ask it to find](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h51m50s)

[all the files I screwed up in That might](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h51m52s)

[that might take too long I can probably](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h51m55s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h58m56s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h58m59s)

[test in the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m01s)

[uh with the correct letter in this file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m04s)

[I'll go back to just fix this file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m10s)

[This one it picked up I wonder why it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m14s)

[all of a sudden started struggling with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m17s)

[the other one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m18s)

[Okay keep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m27s)

[let's see Um custom color theme test go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m30s)

[here We're going to clean up some of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m34s)

[this for it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m36s)

[Uh let's see We'll do that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m39s)

[The data source must only have Let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m46s)

[So we're going to do this I'm going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m49s)

[fix for it because I think I can do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m51s)

[faster](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m54s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m56s)

[place all of those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=01h59m59s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m02s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m06s)

[the assert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m12s)

[I don't know what throws exactly is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m19s)

[Throws a sync](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m22s)

[And then what is this thing squawking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m25s)

[about](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m27s)

[oh this is assert throws not throws a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m31s)

[sync](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m35s)

[Oh this one isn't awaitable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m39s)

[Okay Really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m49s)

[void](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m51s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h00m54s)

[only have one matching parameter](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m00s)

[Uh okay we'll have to look at that here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m04s)

[in just a second](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m06s)

[A thread executor is not an attribute](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m10s)

[class Uh yes it is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m12s)

[Okay And then we will just await both of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m27s)

[these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m29s)

[Come in here Await both of these That](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m31s)

[gets me into there That gets me into](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m34s)

[there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m36s)

[This gives me an opportunity to do this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m38s)

[This gives me an opportunity to do this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m41s)

[Just clean that up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m43s)

[Okay You are wanting collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m47s)

[initializer No Okay So method data](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m49s)

[source Did we do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m53s)

[Where have we done a method data source](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h01m56s)

[okay So let's figure this one out See](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m11s)

[assert throwsert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m14s)

[that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m20s)

[So is it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m23s)

[any airs i think my intellisense is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m31s)

[dying on me Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m32s)

[that what it was before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m40s)

[Undo buffer Undo buffer Undo buffer](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m43s)

[Exactly That is ex uh that does exist](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h02m56s)

[We're getting too many invalid errors](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m02s)

[and it doesn't know what it's doing Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m04s)

[let's see if we can get these things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m10s)

[undo Dialog host test next](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m11s)

[See](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m19s)

[please fix this file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m22s)

[I think this is probably the fastest way](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m25s)

[to undo all of my all of my badness is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m27s)

[just let the AI fix it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m30s)

[Just is probably the safest Like and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m34s)

[think again if I if I can help plug the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m37s)

[event again Where'd it go where'd it go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m41s)

[i have it Right So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m44s)

[because I do I do strongly believe that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m49s)

[this like these AIs are a great tool I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m53s)

[think they are overhyped as the industry](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h03m57s)

[killer that some people think they are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m00s)

[but I absolutely believe that they are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m02s)

[an amazing tool because me trying to go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m04s)

[through and figure out what these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m06s)

[letters are individually is not nearly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m07s)

[as fast as the magical AI just doing it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m10s)

[for me Like even if it's wrong it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m14s)

[going to be a lot writer than I will be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m18s)

[Oh look It caught on to the fact that it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m24s)

[was getting these wrong and has fixed](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m27s)

[that too Excellent](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m28s)

[Thank you for not being dumb co-pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m32s)

[I mean you're still dumb](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m36s)

[And you know what we Oh Oh Okay So I was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m39s)

[lamenting this with one of my colleagues](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m44s)

[the other day too is one of the things I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m47s)

[have found is one of the limitations is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m50s)

[my speed and ability to get the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m53s)

[appropriate context and request into the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m55s)

[agent in order for it to do the right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h04m58s)

[thing right because sometimes you have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m00s)

[to you have to give it enough knowledge](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m02s)

[to do the right bit of work and it's not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m04s)

[always trivial to give it that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m07s)

[information and sometimes it takes a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m09s)

[little while It's like well that's kind](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m11s)

[of annoying](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m14s)

[but but we can just talk to it We'll try](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m16s)

[that next We'll just try that next Like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m19s)

[because what's what's more newagy than](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m22s)

[just like I'm going to talk to the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m24s)

[computer and tell it to do it like I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m27s)

[mean it's going slow It's only 250 lines](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m30s)

[down but I'm trying to think of how many](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m32s)

[lines down I would be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m34s)

[It is bothering me that it is dropping](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m37s)

[comments](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m40s)

[So we are we're gonna have to we're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m41s)

[gonna have to watch this thing like a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m43s)

[hawk on the PR](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m44s)

[because it is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m50s)

[it is potentially screwing some of these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m52s)

[up But at least if it gets it most of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m54s)

[the way back](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m56s)

[like that'll be good enough because I'd](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h05m58s)

[really hate to go through and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m02s)

[redo all the work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m04s)

[because that's the alternative right is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m09s)

[I just revert the commit where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m11s)

[everything went wrong and say you know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m12s)

[what start over](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m14s)

[But that would make me sad And I don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m17s)

[like being sad I like being happier It's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m19s)

[much nicer to be happier than sad That's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m22s)

[my opinion](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m24s)

[Uh where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m27s)

[there it is Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m33s)

[Sorry](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m37s)

[Uh yeah sure I wish this thing does this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m39s)

[thing give me the option of split editor](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m42s)

[No I don't I like I want the diff left](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m46s)

[and right I don't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m48s)

[keep I don't want I don't actually want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m50s)

[a split editor Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m54s)

[that gets me close](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h06m57s)

[Okay it once again lost its mind and is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m03s)

[convinced we're an NUnit now Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m06s)

[You're a [ __ ] Thank you Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m08s)

[you know maybe I'm wondering maybe it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m16s)

[would be quicker to revert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m17s)

[Oh do I really want to do that okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m20s)

[let's test that theory Stash these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m23s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m25s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m28s)

[and this is the problematic one So we're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m29s)

[going to go down here Uh revert commit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m32s)

[No](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m36s)

[Okay so we've got all the changes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m38s)

[and some of these we definitely want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m43s)

[not revert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m45s)

[Like this one we don't want to do So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m47s)

[remember we're looking at the back](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m50s)

[because we reverted We're looking at the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m52s)

[inverse of what we're doing So and this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m53s)

[we absolutely don't want either We want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h07m58s)

[to get rid of xunit That's the goal](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m00s)

[We're going to tun This change here is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m02s)

[removing the xunit runner So yep we want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m06s)

[to keep that Put that back We just want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m09s)

[to find So we want to keep that because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m12s)

[that's a mess We want to keep that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m15s)

[because that's a mess Keep that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m17s)

[Uh we uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m22s)

[by keep I mean I want to keep the revert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m26s)

[of it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m28s)

[So any of the things that are the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m33s)

[that I think we hold](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m38s)

[that all looks good Keep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m42s)

[I'm I'm reverting things out of the I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m46s)

[dropping things out of the revert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m48s)

[if they are the good stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m51s)

[We'll just do these ones over because I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m56s)

[don't know what I was doing And someone](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h08m59s)

[should remind me Save and commit often](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h09m01s)

[That way I don't have to throw this away](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h09m05s)

[co-pilot our way to victory I refuse to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m01s)

[say vibe code my way to victory](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m03s)

[because that just has the wrong vibe](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m07s)

[So I think this is where I screwed up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m43s)

[before right is I had regular expression](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m45s)

[turned on and this matches a set We do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m48s)

[not want that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m52s)

[We do not want that at all Right so we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m54s)

[are going to intentionally not have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m57s)

[regular expressions enabled for this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h10m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m05s)

[entire solution Let's just go current](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m07s)

[project Replace all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m08s)

[Right That should fix all of those Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m11s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m16s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m17s)

[what is this constructor accepts I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m22s)

[innumerable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m24s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m30s)

[I don't know what it moved around here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m34s)

[but this has clearly lost its mind But](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m37s)

[this should be assert that A B and C](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m39s)

[election](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m43s)

[is equal to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m47s)

[the collection and then that goes away](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m50s)

[Yes So there was just a lot of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m52s)

[um but this is probably](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m55s)

[we need a set](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h11m59s)

[Oh and this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m06s)

[async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m09s)

[task](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m11s)

[Okay Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m14s)

[now this So where are we tree list view](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m17s)

[tests Okay So let's go here Now now we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m20s)

[can do this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m23s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m25s)

[wait Preview test No Tree list view test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m28s)

[Where are we wpf test internal Oh we are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m32s)

[up here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m35s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m39s)

[Um get you out of here New context](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m41s)

[Uh speech extension](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m49s)

[Sure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m52s)

[Let's do this We're We're gonna We're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m54s)

[going to try this because if I if I can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m55s)

[make it go and do my bidding this will](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h12m58s)

[this will be awesome](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m00s)

[Please update all test methods in this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m04s)

[file to be async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m07s)

[Uh yep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m22s)

[Uh do it Where's the go button](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m34s)

[is it going i am confused](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m43s)

[Is it thinking i'm wondering if it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m48s)

[thinking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m50s)

[Hello pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m52s)

[Okay we're going to race Which one of us](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m55s)

[can get this done faster](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h13m59s)

[I think this is probably what this was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m14s)

[before and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m16s)

[lost its mind](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m21s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m23s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m26s)

[it going now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m28s)

[Thank you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m31s)

[Keep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m35s)

[we'll come back to you in a minute I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m37s)

[going to continue playing with this Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m38s)

[so I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m41s)

[Nope Nope You're you're not helping Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m43s)

[assert that Oh this should actually I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m46s)

[I've got this backwards even](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m48s)

[collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m51s)

[because it's actual expected It's not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m53s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h14m57s)

[That collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m04s)

[use collection expression That's fine So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m06s)

[what are you what are you squawking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m08s)

[about here i'm confused Um is equal to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m09s)

[Yeah that's correct](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m15s)

[Why do I not believe you visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m23s)

[value assertion builder I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m26s)

[with you don't know what you're talking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m28s)

[about](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m29s)

[right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m31s)

[is equal to see it's the same problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m35s)

[here Why](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m38s)

[yeah So this is whatever reax garbage](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m45s)

[past Kevin did he should be fired for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m48s)

[because past Kevin didn't know what he](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m52s)

[was doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m55s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h15m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m01s)

[it should be that should be that And I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m03s)

[sure it saved past Kevin a little bit of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m06s)

[time but why is this failing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m07s)

[insert that treeview collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m10s)

[Right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m16s)

[Oh there's Okay I see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m28s)

[Because the uh Let's see No no no Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m32s)

[no I just want because now that you know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m38s)

[what it is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m41s)

[prefer static readonly fields over](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m45s)

[constant array arguments The call method](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m47s)

[is called repeatedly Oh dear heavens we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m50s)

[are going to suppress that immediately](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h16m52s)

[Yeah I get So th this is actually a good](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m00s)

[thing right so this is one of the I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m03s)

[assume this is a new analyzer Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m04s)

[enabled by default int net 9 So this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m07s)

[something new int net 9 and this is one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m09s)

[of the things that usually bites people](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m11s)

[when they upgrade their net version](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m12s)

[right is new analyzers it's your your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m14s)

[code hasn't gotten any worse It's just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m17s)

[now it's being flagged because if you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m18s)

[had a method like this that was invoked](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m20s)

[multiple times over you are repeatedly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m22s)

[recreating an array instance with two](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m25s)

[items in it every time and that is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m27s)

[wasteful It is much better to only](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m30s)

[create the array once especially if it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m32s)

[just going to have a constant set of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m35s)

[items that don't change and reuse it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m36s)

[Right that's what this is saying However](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m39s)

[this is a test method](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m42s)

[Right so this is not a concern of mine](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m45s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m51s)

[this is a different problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m53s)

[Uh and it's only a problem because of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h17m58s)

[the way this is set up So we're gonna](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m00s)

[we're gonna just fix this be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m04s)

[uh because of the way this is set up I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m08s)

[don't doubt I'm probably going to get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m12s)

[some of these wrong](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m13s)

[Let's see Is equivalent to and then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m16s)

[these become just an array initializer](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m19s)

[Tell it to shut up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m23s)

[Oh it can't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m30s)

[generic innumerable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m34s)

[Interesting Interesting Interesting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m37s)

[Interesting This is one of the few cases](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m39s)

[where it doesn't work Oh that is very](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m41s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m44s)

[I am shocked](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m46s)

[Okay Uh let's see CA goes to the end](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m48s)

[uh I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m54s)

[and then this gets like this and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h18m58s)

[is equivalent to and it just works](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m03s)

[We tell that thing to shut up And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m07s)

[this needs to be test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m08s)

[and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m11s)

[is equivalent to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m15s)

[and then this is just a bunch of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m18s)

[collection simplification](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m22s)

[I'm surprised](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m29s)

[it doesn't understand how to do that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m31s)

[That that'll work This is kind of dumb](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m35s)

[though](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m38s)

[This should be the same thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m41s)

[The fact it's because I I did the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m44s)

[replacement on the the the nested one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m46s)

[without looking at what it was doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m49s)

[because the dot dot is what's called the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m51s)

[spread operator So imagine you're making](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m53s)

[a a sandwich with peanut butter and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m55s)

[jelly You spread out the peanut butter](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h19m57s)

[So the spread operator takes in a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m00s)

[collection of items and spreads them out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m03s)

[You can all also think of it like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m05s)

[fanning a deck of cards out on the table](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m06s)

[right you you spread them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m08s)

[where the uh the items in your array are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m11s)

[each of the individual cards](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m13s)

[right so but that's kind it's stupid to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m16s)

[kind of uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m19s)

[build these things up just to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m22s)

[uh like build an array just to spread](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m25s)

[the items out like Oh it's still that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m27s)

[static](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m31s)

[Do not like that do not like that at all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m33s)

[I am not happy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m36s)

[I am not happy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m39s)

[See](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m42s)

[yeah The fact that this thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m45s)

[I I'm I'm just going to assume that a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m49s)

[bunch of these are going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m51s)

[fail](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m53s)

[Uh collection initialization can be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m57s)

[simplified Can it can it really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h20m58s)

[uh okay getting annoyed with this So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m02s)

[we're going to do this maneuver We're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m04s)

[going to make sure Reax is off](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m06s)

[Okay replace all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m10s)

[That is much better Much better Much](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m14s)

[better Much better These ones I believe](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m17s)

[should be able to be converted Nope Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m20s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m24s)

[is equivalent to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m26s)

[it's making it uh let's see is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m29s)

[equivalent to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m33s)

[this one I think we can do on the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m35s)

[yeah so we want this to be new but we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m40s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m42s)

[want that to be the collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m44s)

[expression right we don't want to spread](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m46s)

[on the the thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m48s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m53s)

[is equivalent to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m55s)

[just make our life a little bit simpler](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h21m58s)

[collection expression collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m00s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m02s)

[very very could](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m04s)

[can't change that one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m06s)

[is equivalent to this one We absolutely](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m09s)

[can because that is an array on the left](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m12s)

[of the equals because when you do these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m14s)

[collection expressions](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m16s)

[the compiler has to be able to know what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m18s)

[the target type is by looking at what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m21s)

[the assignment is going towards Right so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m23s)

[in this case the left side of the equals](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m25s)

[these were passed into a method It's the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m27s)

[parameter type that it uses](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m29s)

[But when it can do it the compiler can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m34s)

[actually build up a very efficient](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m36s)

[collection depending on what that target](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m38s)

[type is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m40s)

[Um sometimes the the the generated types](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m42s)

[that the compiler can build are actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m44s)

[even more efficient than what you can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m46s)

[express in C yourself](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m49s)

[Sometimes the C# team likes to flex a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m52s)

[little bit and say "Yeah look at this We](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m54s)

[can do something insanely efficient](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m55s)

[because we are the compiler." like yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h22m57s)

[you're right Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m02s)

[why](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m06s)

[why am I doing any of this this is just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m10s)

[a list of strings](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m13s)

[So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m16s)

[then I get rid of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m22s)

[Like I am realizing I was doing new on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m27s)

[all of these but I don't think I need to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m29s)

[do new on any of these Like I can just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m30s)

[do this instead](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m34s)

[The compiler knows](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m37s)

[how to sort that out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m39s)

[Yeah So there's probably some back there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m47s)

[that I could go back and make more](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m50s)

[efficient and not have them suck quite](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m51s)

[as badly But](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m54s)

[like all of these these are just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m56s)

[straight up individual lines And I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h23m58s)

[for my talk I actually when we get to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m02s)

[collection expressions my sample is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m04s)

[something very similar um to this where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m06s)

[it just there's a lot of um improvements](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m09s)

[that come like in a lot of cases the C](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m13s)

[team like I joked earlier that they get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m16s)

[feature envy with other languages but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m18s)

[they really do try to make sure that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m20s)

[they are improving the language in ways](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m22s)

[that make sense right and so like there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m26s)

[was there There was one discussion I got](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m30s)

[to be involved in where they were they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m32s)

[were looking at potential new syntax I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m34s)

[trying to remember what it was for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m36s)

[I think it was for the null assignment](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m38s)

[operator that's supposed to be coming in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m40s)

[C14](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m42s)

[And there was a lot of debate about Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m45s)

[no no it was it was these collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m47s)

[expressions because right now some](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m50s)

[collection expressions like dictionaries](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m52s)

[constructor they have overloads on them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m54s)

[that take in So for example if I do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h24m58s)

[dictionary of string string right and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m02s)

[go you know food gets new right there's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m06s)

[an overload here that takes in things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m10s)

[like an equality compare right which is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m13s)

[great except for when I do just the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m15s)

[scrape square braces around the items](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m18s)

[there's no way for me to specify an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m21s)

[equality compare And so the debate was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m23s)

[around](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m25s)

[uh zoom in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m28s)

[Why is it not letting go of my keyboard](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m32s)

[there we go Um the debate was around how](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m36s)

[to actually express that in a collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m39s)

[expression and like because there's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m41s)

[there's plenty of ways that could be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m45s)

[done but the the debate was around what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m46s)

[is what is the right way which is not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m50s)

[nearly as simple of a question to answer](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m52s)

[right and it got even more interesting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m55s)

[because the the simple answer is well](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h25m58s)

[well obviously you just put a comma and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m01s)

[you you express it right at the end of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m04s)

[the set of items](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m06s)

[But that doesn't actually work because C](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m08s)

[is a left to right language Right so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m11s)

[like in English we read words left to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m14s)

[right The compiler reads code left to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m16s)

[right as well And so you can't do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m19s)

[something at the end of the sentence](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m22s)

[that modifies the beginning part of the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m25s)

[sentence because once the compiler's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m27s)

[gone through there's not this back and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m29s)

[forth stuff like it's it's already gone](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m31s)

[past And so figuring out a good syntax](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m34s)

[for that is weird and difficult and hard](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m38s)

[And I think that discussion ended with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m43s)

["Yep we're still thinking on it or](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m45s)

[something about about that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m48s)

[that effect Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m50s)

[null](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h26m55s)

[That](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m00s)

[is null](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m02s)

[I do kind of wonder if I could turn the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m04s)

[AI loose on this at this point and tell](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m06s)

[it to go fix up the rest of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m07s)

[I just I don't know I some part of me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m11s)

[actually enjoys](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m14s)

[some of this typing and thinking through](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m16s)

[this Like I don't know that solidifies](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m17s)

[it in my head when I have the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m20s)

[opportunity to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m21s)

[um do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m24s)

[is empty](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m27s)

[And though this reax garbage is annoying](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m30s)

[me a little bit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m34s)

[I I I I think past Kevin did something](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m36s)

[like this I I don't know but it does](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m39s)

[strike me as something that pass Kevin](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m42s)

[would absolutely do He is that level of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m44s)

[crazy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m47s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m50s)

[Wait And then this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m53s)

[You really want to do a better](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m55s)

[collection expression Great And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h27m57s)

[assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m01s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m04s)

[empty](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m06s)

[This is just so sad](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m09s)

[because I think I had intentionally](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m14s)

[tried to rewrite these so that it it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m16s)

[pulled it across but I I think I didn't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m18s)

[factor in the fact that some of my](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m21s)

[values were like curly braces with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m23s)

[initializers in them So it only handled](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m26s)

[the uh the simple case](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m29s)

[is empty](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m37s)

[Uh await task completed task This is a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m41s)

[stupid line](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m45s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m47s)

[Well we got through one Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m50s)

[Enable Enable Yeah And you can tell I am](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m53s)

[running preview builds of Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m56s)

[So I see that yellow bar a lot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h28m58s)

[I will say though in general](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m02s)

[um Visual Studio is the preview builds](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m05s)

[are very stable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m09s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m12s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m14s)

[equivalent to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m16s)

[okay what is your problem here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h29m27s)

[I don't I don't fully understand what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m20s)

[that thing's telling me yet And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m22s)

[especially since this thing here clearly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m25s)

[works](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m28s)

[Why is it just these early ones that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m34s)

[it's squawking at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m36s)

[Yeah Assert that collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m43s)

[Oh is it is it because it wants the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m55s)

[implicit type conversion can't figure it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h30m58s)

[out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m01s)

[Is that the problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m02s)

[there okay Well dumb but we'll make it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m09s)

[work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m14s)

[Why is Zumit doing this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m16s)

[zumit I think you've lost your mind and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m23s)

[you need to be rebooted](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m24s)

[you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m28s)

[Uh there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m30s)

[Think about what you've done for a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m33s)

[you want to go down](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m36s)

[There Okay There we go There we go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m39s)

[Okay Airl And we continue on with the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m45s)

[other ones](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m48s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m51s)

[uh Let's see here Assert that Yeah this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h31m59s)

[is one of those cases where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m02s)

[this guy is almost assuredly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m10s)

[my reax problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m15s)

[Okay so we're going to clean these up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m19s)

[and let's see if we can actually fix](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m20s)

[this up with the AI because I think this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m22s)

[is something it can handle uh dialog](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m26s)

[host test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m28s)

[We're going to go here and let's pick on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m31s)

[one of the first errors So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m33s)

[where is Yeah we're going to new context](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m42s)

[window it and we're going to go with fix](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m46s)

[the assert nulls](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h32m49s)

[pretty good](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h33m35s)

[Holy cow It is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h34m34s)

[well on a positive note it's fixing them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h34m40s)

[and it appears to be doing them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h34m46s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h34m48s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m10s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m14s)

[you didn't get them all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m17s)

[we're just let let's keep going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m33s)

[False False](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m41s)

[We're going to We're going to let this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m44s)

[guy rock and roll](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m46s)

[See but I made a commit this time So now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h35m57s)

[I can watch it like a hawk](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m00s)

[Or were those assert falses i know I saw](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m05s)

[some in here for](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m07s)

[need the rest of file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m14s)

[Keep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m25s)

[Did it Did it really change six files no](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m29s)

[it only changed one Did it do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m31s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m34s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m36s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m40s)

[that was pretty simple Let's keep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m42s)

[looking down here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m45s)

[It didn't fix them all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m47s)

[There's an assert true Assert true](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m52s)

[There's these Assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h36m55s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m00s)

[what is this one doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m14s)

[task](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m17s)

[Clear this out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m22s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m25s)

[ensure all the test methods in this file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m27s)

[are made async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m30s)

[Okay go fix those because that should](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m39s)

[fix up that here in just a second](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m41s)

[I'm going to move you off to the side](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m44s)

[I'm if I'm if I'm gonna get the full AI](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m48s)

[experience I want it to to do work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m50s)

[alongside me](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m53s)

[Um so I'm gonna move this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h37m56s)

[I'm going to do the real work and let it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m00s)

[think about its life and contemplate how](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m02s)

[to make a method async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m04s)

[Didn't do the whole file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m15s)

[It It changed some but it didn't change](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m18s)

[them all You jerk](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m21s)

[All test methods in data grid assist](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m23s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m26s)

[I'm in dialogue host tests](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m28s)

[Go back I'm in I'm in I got the wrong](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m31s)

[file open It switched when we did a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m34s)

[ensure all methods in this file are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m41s)

[async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m44s)

[I'm realizing that maybe I don't want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m48s)

[all methods but](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m50s)

[Okay let's keep going That'll deal with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m53s)

[that That'll deal with that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m56s)

[Fix that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h38m59s)

[That](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m02s)

[is true](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m05s)

[Wait assert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m10s)

[that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m13s)

[is false](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m16s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m19s)

[Keep](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m27s)

[Oh it's unhappy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m32s)

[Uh overwrite](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m36s)

[probably just threw away some of my work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m38s)

[Oh but it fixed up most the file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m44s)

[except for this one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m47s)

[I may have overwritten in my ACE And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m50s)

[then it actually fixed most of these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m53s)

[Let's see This is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h39m56s)

[needs to be inside of an async block](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m01s)

[which we can make this an async block I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m05s)

[think we can get away with this Um okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m07s)

[That handles that file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m14s)

[That felt like it was faster than normal](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m18s)

[Radiant bar test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m21s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m25s)

[Because this is a weird one This is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m29s)

[going to be This goes here And there's a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m32s)

[comma now that gets added there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m37s)

[right uh so let's go here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m41s)

[and go with rating bar tests](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m44s)

[Uh oh actually commit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m49s)

[Save what we've got](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m52s)

[Great And then we're going to go rating](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m55s)

[bar tests](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h40m58s)

[Uh close out these things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m01s)

[Ensure all test methods in this file are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m06s)

[async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m09s)

[We're going to let that guy go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m12s)

[and rather than fighting with him I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m15s)

[think the better thing is for me to move](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m17s)

[on to a different file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m19s)

[So let's find whatever one comes next](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m22s)

[after rating bar](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m24s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m28s)

[await you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m34s)

[Uh let's see Async task](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m37s)

[I'm once again going to put you on the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m40s)

[side so I can let you go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m43s)

[and then it claims to be done](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m47s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m51s)

[what ones do we have here sta theory](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m55s)

[just becomes test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h41m59s)

[We can do No it's test with Oh shoot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m01s)

[What is this test with the STA thread](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m05s)

[executor What we want it to be I want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m10s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m14s)

[Place some files Reax is off](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m16s)

[Place all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m20s)

[It only killed five but you know what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m22s)

[five less that I didn't have to deal](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m24s)

[with Okay what else is still in this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m25s)

[file is assignable from](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m27s)

[and there's an assert that here is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m30s)

[off I need the comma there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m33s)

[That gets me close](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m37s)

[And I need the comma there And I'm not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m42s)

[actually confident that I've got the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m44s)

[order of these parameters correct But](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m46s)

[the nice part is all these tests were in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m48s)

[a working state before So if I get the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m50s)

[values backwards that'll be an obvious](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m52s)

[test failure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m54s)

[Why do we have this converter here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h42m57s)

[what are you complaining about](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m01s)

[oh it's because it's being cast to an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m04s)

[interface Okay whatever Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m06s)

[I don't know why we had the 10 in here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m17s)

[That feels weird So we're going to get](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m23s)

[rid of it for now and then see what](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m26s)

[comes when it breaks](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m27s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m38s)

[Let's see here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m41s)

[And this can just be collection](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m45s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m47s)

[Uh let's see here And then the rating](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m49s)

[bar test So let's go We're going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m50s)

[turn this thing loose again Uh because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m54s)

[what is it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h43m57s)

[fix the assert not null calls in this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m01s)

[file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m03s)

[Put it off to the side And while he's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m07s)

[thinking about life and the meaning of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m09s)

[happiness and all the other things I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m11s)

[going to go work on this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m14s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m16s)

[And so hopefully this actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m20s)

[uh let's see I got to await that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m24s)

[Wait that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m28s)

[uh is false](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m32s)

[How you doing co-pilot you still](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m34s)

[thinking still thinking Okay You you you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m36s)

[do you co-pilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m39s)

[Okay Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m43s)

[yep Take that Thanks Okay Come back here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m48s)

[Come back here What else is wrong in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m52s)

[this file](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m54s)

[okay Is assignable from](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h44m55s)

[so I don't know what this needs to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m00s)

[because this is effectively checking to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m03s)

[make sure that we get back a linear](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m06s)

[gradient brush](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m07s)

[So let's see Assert that results](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m10s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m19s)

[is it cuz this guy here is trying to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m28s)

[linear gradient brush right that's the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m34s)

[point of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m38s)

[Look at that We make you static](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m42s)

[Yay We'll gain performance in this all](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m45s)

[at the same time Yay for performance](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m47s)

[Uh let's see Collection initializer can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m53s)

[be simplified](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m55s)

[Okay So that gets me to there So really](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h45m57s)

[I think what I want then uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m01s)

[I want it to turn into this right](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m05s)

[okay So we're going to go actually I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m14s)

[think all of them are in the exact same](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m17s)

[form](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m20s)

[We're just going to cut paste And I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m22s)

[think I'm just going to do these by hand](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m24s)

[because I don't see any reason not to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m26s)

[Yeah because all these things are just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m30s)

[hard casting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m31s)

[at the end of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m33s)

[So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m36s)

[probably could have gone as far as to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m43s)

[blind find and replace](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m45s)

[but I kind of want to look at them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m47s)

[Okay so that handles all of those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h46m56s)

[Okay the snack bar test is almost done](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m02s)

[Let's finish this up and then I will](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m05s)

[give it another file to play with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m07s)

[Uh let's see Is false](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m09s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m14s)

[okay Is this one still needing some work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m16s)

[yes But I don't know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m20s)

[Let's have it Let's have it clean this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m24s)

[up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m26s)

[Uh let's see New context](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m28s)

[This one here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m33s)

[Ensure all test methods in this file are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m36s)

[async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m38s)

[I will say that feels very magical doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m44s)

[that Okay let's look at this one Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m46s)

[let's see apply style because this call](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m49s)

[is not awaited](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m51s)

[that it was probably actually a bug in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m56s)

[the original too I don't think Why is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h47m59s)

[apply style async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m02s)

[oh it wasn't async originally It got](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m05s)

[changed with this Oh look at that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m08s)

[Look at that Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m12s)

[let's see Assert What is this assert](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m21s)

[fail](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m23s)

[what this wants](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m25s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m31s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m36s)

[Um this is wrong here This was checking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m45s)

[for style Assert that style](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m49s)

[See style](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m53s)

[is not null](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h48m58s)

[because paste](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m06s)

[That's what we want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m10s)

[Okay So that goes there How'd you do on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m13s)

[How'd you do on your test co-pilot you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m16s)

[good](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m19s)

[boy Good boy Good boy co-pilot You're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m20s)

[you real developer now You're almost a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m23s)

[real developer Um okay Got to figure out](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m26s)

[the assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m30s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m32s)

[is that really the way to do a search](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m41s)

[single](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m43s)

[there no single](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m45s)

[Okay Well that'll work then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m48s)

[Little surprised that feels like that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m52s)

[feels like something that I want added](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m53s)

[Uh okay So what is this guacing here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m55s)

[assert statements must be awaited](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h49m58s)

[Um which then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m05s)

[yeah because we were doing this back](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m08s)

[differently](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m11s)

[Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m14s)

[That fixes those Okay See we are making](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m16s)

[great progress Uh clean the using up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m19s)

[Let's see Clean the using up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m25s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m28s)

[Let's see Aw wait](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m32s)

[That](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m34s)

[we go Go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m38s)

[Should really just run cleanup on the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m43s)

[whole thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m45s)

[Uh I don't remember what the member data](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m48s)

[change was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m51s)

[Oh we punted on this one didn't we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h50m59s)

[may have to go look that one up in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m01s)

[Tunits](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m03s)

[Docs](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m04s)

[Or actually you know what hey Copilot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m06s)

[Let's see Let's get out of agent mode](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m15s)

[and go into ask mode for a moment New](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m16s)

[What is the proper way in TUnit to use a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m21s)

[function to provide the parameters to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m27s)

[this test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m31s)

[in this case I want to chat I don't want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m35s)

[to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m36s)

[let's see how it works Blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m39s)

[Yeah Uh so short version you're an idiot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m50s)

[co-pilot You're already doing it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m52s)

[correctly Uh no](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m54s)

[no no I am not So so that's that's not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h51m57s)

[very exciting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m01s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m03s)

[this is where we now go to the Googles](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m07s)

[uh T unit member](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m09s)

[data source So C-pilot clearly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m12s)

[needs a little little help Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m17s)

[Nope not discussion I want docs](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m20s)

[Where where where are the docs at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m24s)

[tutorial](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m26s)

[yeah Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m28s)

[parallelism examples migration](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m32s)

[Uh where is the test authoring](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m36s)

[datadriven testing method data sources](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m39s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m41s)

[Let's see here Has two arguments If you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m44s)

[pass in one argument this is the method](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m46s)

[name containing your data We assume they](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m48s)

[turn pass in two arguments The first](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m50s)

[should be a type Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m52s)

[If methods are returning](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h52m56s)

[Oh so it doesn't support](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m04s)

[can also accept tupils if you don't want](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m13s)

[to create lots of new types within your](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m14s)

[test assembly](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m16s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m21s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m22s)

[I wonder if it needs a tupole or if it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m28s)

[ne just needs something that can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m30s)

[deconstruct appropriately](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m32s)

[H okay So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m35s)

[uh in this case I think what it wants is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m38s)

[base theme](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m44s)

[color](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m47s)

[color](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m49s)

[right and then these guys here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m51s)

[become](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h53m57s)

[No not quite what I wanted](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m01s)

[Uh let's see Comma](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m06s)

[And then we just do this down the line](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m09s)

[And we have magically inserted](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m14s)

[at](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m17s)

[I mean points awarded T unit for having](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m19s)

[a nice analyzer to flag that it was](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m22s)

[going to fail](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m24s)

[less cool for not supporting the same](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m26s)

[functionality](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m28s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m29s)

[assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m32s)

[theme foreground is not default](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m34s)

[Got it Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m45s)

[we can clean this up and just go with a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m48s)

[delegate and the world becomes a happy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m50s)

[place Yay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m52s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h54m55s)

[Okay So we need to clean this guy up So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m03s)

[what is your problem here assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m05s)

[expected date is equal to blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m08s)

[uh date only](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m12s)

[So let's see Expected date is a date](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m15s)

[time selected time](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m17s)

[I'm missing something assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m22s)

[expected date](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m24s)

[actually I think um this is supposed to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m28s)

[be here equal to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m31s)

[expected date I think that's the problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m35s)

[is it's going the wrong way uh okay and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m36s)

[then the one we just did](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m40s)

[the member](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m43s)

[the member data sourcy stuff](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m46s)

[member data source this guy you go here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m49s)

[and then we just need to fix you And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m55s)

[then you go here and we just need to fix](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m57s)

[you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h55m59s)

[Uh let's see And then you need to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h56m01s)

[async task I should probably be tasking](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h56m04s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h56m22s)

[is a beautiful option Time picker test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h56m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h57m20s)

[reserve](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h57m22s)

[the new lines](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h57m25s)

[See if this works](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h57m28s)

[Here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h57m31s)

[comes the speedy blue line](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h57m37s)

[the new lines](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m18s)

[You jerk](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m20s)

[You absolute jerk](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m24s)

[Um okay So that's those two changes are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m41s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m44s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m46s)

[how how do I tell you to stop i want you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m49s)

[to stop now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m51s)

[Please stop](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m53s)

[Uh cancel](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m56s)

[I would like you to stop doing work now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h58m59s)

[Back off](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m02s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m04s)

[Okay that is fine And I think all I have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m13s)

[to do now is take](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m16s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m19s)

[The bloody long line that you just wrote](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m23s)

[for me Appreciate that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m26s)

[And then if I turn you into that should](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m30s)

[just work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m33s)

[Okay Now let let's fix the new lines](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m35s)

[that it has so eloquently](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m37s)

[botched for me Was so nice of it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m40s)

[You bad co-pilot You're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m45s)

[You had one job to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m48s)

[there Now at least it's readable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m53s)

[Do the same thing here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=02h59m57s)

[Maybe bring that down Bring that down](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m00s)

[There There There](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m04s)

[There just just to make it like](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m06s)

[normally long method names like this I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m10s)

[would scoff at but in this case it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m12s)

[like I need it to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m14s)

[reasonable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m17s)

[Um let's see here This guy wants the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m19s)

[exact same thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m22s)

[Um and this be what I heard is this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m28s)

[became a bar Oh but oh we can do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m30s)

[something really clever here We can do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m34s)

[something really really clever here So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m36s)

[what we can do is we can actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m39s)

[deconstruct this So uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m41s)

[culture info](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m45s)

[culture](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m48s)

[uh bool is 24hour](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m50s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h00m59s)

[bool with seconds](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m01s)

[uh date time date](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m06s)

[uh string time time string We can do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m10s)

[this Then I can delete all of these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m13s)

[and get rid of this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m17s)

[and it should appropriately deconstruct](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m20s)

[this sucker into](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m23s)

[uh it cannot deconstruct](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m26s)

[six elements into five variables](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m29s)

[Okay So what did I do wrong so it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m35s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m38s)

[this is the one I don't care about not](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m40s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m42s)

[I can do that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m44s)

[And then the issue it's going to have is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m47s)

[it wants to assign to these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m49s)

[and that ain't going to work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m53s)

[Um because before it had an array that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m56s)

[it can mutate and now it doesn't have an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h01m59s)

[array to mutate](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m01s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m03s)

[invert the order of parameters](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m07s)

[So date and time string What is this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m17s)

[oh because these are in a different](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m25s)

[order](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m27s)

[Oh because we we kept the expect Oh I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h02m46s)

[we do date](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m28s)

[And then we don't um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m31s)

[realize I needed to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m44s)

[Then that becomes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m46s)

[slight rename of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m48s)

[This becomes time string and this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m52s)

[becomes expected time](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m56s)

[And now it just works](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h03m59s)

[Go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m02s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m05s)

[that got me to there Where are we at on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m07s)

[Okay we got some some issues with net 6](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m17s)

[and some things not being supported](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m21s)

[Okay so what do we got here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m27s)

[uh let's see Calendar tests](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h04m30s)

[calendar info](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h05m02s)

[timeout as much anymore So we can just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h05m39s)

[replace all of these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h05m42s)

[That'll be okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h05m45s)

[That is very much an exunit 2 mentality](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h05m47s)

[Go back over to here Calendar test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h06m13s)

[What's the air any errors left in here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h06m16s)

[oh just some unused using Clean those up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h06m20s)

[That fixes those Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h06m23s)

[uh this does not support floatingoint](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h07m48s)

[math in net 6 or 472 so we're going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h07m52s)

[have to address that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h07m56s)

[uh let's see here Keep going down though](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h07m59s)

[Pilot fix the clock test ones Let's go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m05s)

[check those](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m09s)

[Those now show compiling Great](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m11s)

[What's that enum data one is going to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m15s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m17s)

[We'll need to address it What are you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m19s)

[Do that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m27s)

[Trying to think of how I want to handle](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m29s)

[that enume one That's kind of a weird](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m31s)

[one Uh let's see Assert that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m32s)

[What is this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m50s)

[so this is this should be enume values](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m54s)

[add because a hash sets add function](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h08m59s)

[returns a bool](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m02s)

[And so the idea here is we just are](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m04s)

[adding all of them into a hash set And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m07s)

[if add returns false it means it didn't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m09s)

[add something because of a duplicate](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m12s)

[value In this case the because the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m14s)

[compare being fed into the hash set says](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m18s)

[okay we're going to compare strings and](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m20s)

[we're going to ignore case This is an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m22s)

[easy way effectively to get a distinct](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m24s)

[set of strings that uh uh where it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m26s)

[case insensitive comparison Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m30s)

[and then we're going to add a because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m34s)

[that goes there We already did that one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m46s)

[Clean that up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m50s)

[That up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m54s)

[Are you squawking about here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h09m59s)

[uh should be disposed of with inside of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m02s)

[a cleanup method](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m04s)

[I think it is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m06s)

[It is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m10s)

[Oh that's a T unit](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m13s)

[Interesting So we need a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m16s)

[What is their cleanup way of doing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m20s)

[things](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m22s)

[uh let's see What is their Oh it's going](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m25s)

[to be test life cycle test cleanups](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m28s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m34s)

[so let's see here this is created in a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m42s)

[after test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m47s)

[So we can then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m49s)

[yeah so we want to do this We want to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m55s)

[get rid of that And we don't want to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h10m58s)

[We don't need to do that anymore And I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h11m03s)

[what the fallout from that is I assume](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h14m16s)

[we're going to need to write uh a little](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h14m18s)

[I I wonder can I do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m07s)

[drop you drop you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m13s)

[up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m17s)

[matrix method and I think you support](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m19s)

[class](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m23s)

[enume](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m25s)

[and then enume](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m28s)

[uh get values](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m32s)

[I don't know that that's going to work](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m35s)

[No data source provided](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m39s)

[And the reason I don't know that this is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m42s)

[going to work is because this would need](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m44s)

[to know the generic overload for this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m47s)

[and I don't know how to specify that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m50s)

[I think that would be somewhat](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h15m59s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m01s)

[because this guy here yeah he does](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m03s)

[nothing in the way of getting the](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m06s)

[nothing in the way of actually getting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m12s)

[what we need](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m15s)

[But can I just derive from this matrix](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m18s)

[attribute instead maybe I can drive from](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m20s)

[the matrix attribute instead](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m23s)

[Probably just as easy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m26s)

[And actually I might even be able to go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m37s)

[further than that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m39s)

[Okay hold on hold on hold on Idea idea](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m41s)

[idea idea I think what we can do is we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m44s)

[can do discard changes](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m46s)

[And I think what we can do is we can go](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m50s)

[to the enum data attribute And I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m51s)

[we can do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m53s)

[matrix attribute](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m55s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h16m58s)

[TE En](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m00s)

[because I think what I can do is on this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m19s)

[guy here he wants T objects](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m22s)

[So down here get rid of all of this And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m27s)

[this guy is just wanting a constructor](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m33s)

[that takes a param So in here what I can](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m35s)

[just do is enume get values](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m39s)

[pen](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m44s)

[and literally feed this into the base](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h17m46s)

[Let's see And then we need to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m01s)

[see non-generic method](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m09s)

[Uh why there is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m14s)

[what do you mean non-generic method oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m21s)

[doesn't exist as a generic in all cases](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m27s)

[That was something that was added later](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m31s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m35s)

[so it exists in some but not in others](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m41s)

[Let's back this up What we're going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m45s)

[do is we're going to make this not suck](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m46s)

[So pound if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m49s)

[uh net](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m52s)

[six or greater I believe has the generic](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m55s)

[It's only the four five one that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h18m59s)

[biting me else](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m01s)

[and if](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m05s)

[Yeah So that's fine there And then we're](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m08s)

[going to switch ourselves to 452 And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m10s)

[this is going to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m12s)

[uh enim](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m15s)

[get values](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m17s)

[type of p enume](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m19s)

[uh let's see of type](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m24s)

[I can't type of type](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m29s)

[po okay of type thank you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m32s)

[to array](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m38s)

[now Why you are being unhappy about this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m41s)

[because I didn't do the right number of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m46s)

[closing pension](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m47s)

[initializing can be simplified Sure](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m51s)

[Spread That's fine We can do that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m53s)

[Now I should have an enum data attribute](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h19m57s)

[and I can go enim data](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m02s)

[math operation](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m07s)

[and theory](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m11s)

[No data source provided I don't know](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m14s)

[what that means](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m17s)

[Oh data source provided](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m22s)

[because isn't that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m25s)

[Oh I need to do matrix data source on](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m28s)

[top](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m31s)

[Make it happy Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m34s)

[that works Does mean a little bit of](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m39s)

[duplication but you know what that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m41s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m44s)

[Let's go chase the rest of those down](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m46s)

[Uh let's see collection that doesn't](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m49s)

[exist in this assembly anymore So that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m51s)

[just goes away](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m53s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m56s)

[Uh let's see This is another matrix data](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h20m58s)

[source](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m01s)

[up using](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m07s)

[enume data math operation](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m10s)

[I work there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m14s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m18s)

[let's see here This one](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m24s)

[Oh this one did not need to be made](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m31s)

[async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m33s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m37s)

[I am a little surprised but I I realize](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m42s)

[that these methods throw So that's it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m45s)

[it's sort of a test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m48s)

[Uh where is it complaining](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m55s)

[oh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h21m58s)

[task](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m07s)

[Wait](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m10s)

[Okay that gets me there But I probably](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m13s)

[have now broken](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m17s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m20s)

[Be a bunch of these 20 in fact](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m27s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m30s)

[where else did it get used clock test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m34s)

[Clock picker test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m36s)

[I think most of them are going to be Oh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m39s)

[that's going to be a problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m42s)

[That is going to be a problem](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m47s)

[I don't like that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m53s)

[do not like that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h22m58s)

[Um let's see Before](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m00s)

[test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m04s)

[public async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m10s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m13s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m16s)

[Uh let's see Async](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m18s)

[mask](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m21s)

[Then I'm going to just do this down here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m23s)

[That'll make that Now we can deal with](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m30s)

[that I don't think there's any reason](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m33s)

[why](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m35s)

[order of this would matter](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m38s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m41s)

[these](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m43s)

[things are going to need to be down here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m45s)

[now because I need the the style applied](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m47s)

[which means these things can't be read](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m50s)

[only That's fine That's fine There's an](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m51s)

[argument to be made that color picker](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m56s)

[probably doesn't need to be even in here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h23m57s)

[at all And we can just straight up do it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m00s)

[like that and call it a day there](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m02s)

[That'll handle that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m05s)

[Let's see here And then oh it wants](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m11s)

[these things technically nullable](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m14s)

[I don't really I I kind of want to just](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m22s)

[tell it to shut up because I know that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m23s)

[the TUnit is going to execute the setup](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m25s)

[and that these things have to be](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m28s)

[assigned at that point](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m29s)

[So I'm going to just shut it up Tell it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m32s)

[I'm the developer Darn it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m34s)

[Okay And the good news is we have a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m38s)

[bunch of these Bad news is we have a](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m41s)

[bunch of these Uh let's see Let's do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m44s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m47s)

[end up doing the same thing here And](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m48s)

[actually it's probably good that we](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m51s)

[catch some of these because I think](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m53s)

[that this dispose pattern is probably](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h24m58s)

[being used in a bunch of places and I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m00s)

[need to not be doing that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m02s)

[It gets new](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m05s)

[again Just throw you away Can await you](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m08s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m12s)

[the after test](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m16s)

[No](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m22s)

[that's probably for the better to have](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m24s)

[something more akin to that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m26s)

[Uh let's see And then back to our](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m29s)

[warnings slashairs](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m32s)

[See that's just in a test already So](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m35s)

[he's easy](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m37s)

[in a test already](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m39s)

[in a test already](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m42s)

[They see pass now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m45s)

[We actually have a thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m48s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h25m52s)

[the the issue here is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m03s)

[this is actually spinning a thread](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m08s)

[like this is this thread start like this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m11s)

[delegate is declared void So by putting](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m15s)

[an async on here I've literally declared](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m18s)

[an async void lambda](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m20s)

[That's terrifying That is terrifying to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m28s)

[say the least All because this thing](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m31s)

[here wants to have these asserts in them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m33s)

[Boy I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m46s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m48s)

[I'm thinking we're going to change this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m53s)

[because](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m54s)

[I don't the these are not cases that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h26m57s)

[actually realistically occur](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m00s)

[And so I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m08s)

[we're going to do this We're going to do](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m11s)

[this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m14s)

[We're going to do this](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m16s)

[Where I typoed it Um that way like it's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m26s)

[it's now going to cause all errors where](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m31s)

[I put all of those awaits But](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m33s)

[I think I would rather remove them](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m37s)

[and not do this kind of setup because it](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m40s)

[it just feels like something that's](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m44s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m46s)

[cause extra grief without a lot of gain](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m48s)

[Flection expression there while we're in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m53s)

[here](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h27m55s)

[Yeah cuz this is just a lot of pain to](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m00s)

[do An an async void delegate being](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m03s)

[passed to a thread Feels like a recipe](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m06s)

[for shooting yourself in the foot](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m09s)

[And as exciting as that is](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m12s)

[I I think I want to keep my feet](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m17s)

[I do like the idea of doing these in](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m23s)

[setup methods now rather than otherwise](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m25s)

[That still makes me feel good But I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m29s)

[don't know that I](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m31s)

[that](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m40s)

[Let's see where we're at now](https://youtu.be/2mMHC5kpQsg?t=03h28m42s)
