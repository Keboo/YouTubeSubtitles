[okay and we are live and going welcome](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h06m45s)



[back everyone I am excited to finally](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h06m49s)



[have some time for coding it has been a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h06m52s)



[busy week for me and I haven't had](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h06m53s)



[enough time to code it so I am very](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h06m56s)



[excited to finally have an evening to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h06m58s)



[spend time doing it so for tonight I'm](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m00s)



[gonna deviate just for a little bit from](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m03s)



[my usual material design in zamel I got](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m05s)



[distracted over the weekend playing with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m08s)



[Azure logic apps and found them to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m09s)



[really cool so wanted to show you guys](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m12s)



[sort of what they are how they work and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m16s)



[then I'll show off the little one that I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m19s)



[built to help out a little bit with this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m20s)



[stream so kind of just a practical](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m23s)



[application of some of the cool stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m26s)



[that you can do with them so let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m28s)



[switch over here and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m30s)



[not that one that one okay so for anyone](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m35s)



[who has an MSDN subscription you have a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m40s)



[bunch of free azure credits on the table](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m43s)



[every month and so if you are not using](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m46s)



[those I would encourage you to log in to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m48s)



[msdn.microsoft.com click the little](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m51s)



[button to activate your as your benefits](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m54s)



[and start taking advantage of them](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m55s)



[because some of the stuff that's out](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m58s)



[there is really quite awesome so we're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h07m59s)



[gonna just walk through real quick sort](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m02s)



[of what a logic app is and how to build](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m04s)



[one so I'm back up here I've just got an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m06s)



[empty resource group I called it just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m09s)



[testing just as a kind of a playground](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m11s)



[area to go through and have some fun in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m14s)



[so we're gonna add a new resource do a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m15s)



[quick search for logic apps and to do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m18s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m26s)



[logic apps there it is and create button](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m27s)



[and so we'll give this one stream mean](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m36s)



[demo](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m43s)



[Wow I cannot type tonight stream ing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m46s)



[last time I checked okay and we will put](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m53s)



[it in an existing resource group and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m55s)



[sure central us sounds great so this is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h08m58s)



[going to be the name of my logic app how](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m02s)



[am I going to pay for its with an MSDN](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m04s)



[subscription we'll put it in an existing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m07s)



[resource group that we have and then the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m09s)



[location is just going to default to the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m11s)



[same location as my resource group which](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m14s)



[is central us which is great and we'll](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m16s)



[hit create and let it go for anyone](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m18s)



[who's used the service if this then that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m21s)



[you can sort of think of logic apps as](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m24s)



[an enterprise-grade](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m27s)



[solution that have kind of the same idea](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m28s)



[but I guess a lot more power behind them](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m33s)



[so with if this then that you're sort of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m36s)



[limited to you know if thing a happens](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m38s)



[then do thing be alright with logic apps](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m41s)



[you can get a lot more advanced you can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m44s)



[build conditional logic loops you're not](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m47s)



[limited just by the connectors that they](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m50s)



[give you you can roll your own you can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m53s)



[have a call out your own to your own](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m55s)



[rest function and you can build your own](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h09m57s)



[connectors if you want so let's let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m00s)



[take a look at this because this this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m02s)



[got me real excited over the weekend](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m05s)



[when I was playing with it and it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m07s)



[started to get me thinking about all of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m08s)



[the things that I wanted to then build](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m11s)



[and use it use it for so cuz it works](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m12s)



[really really well at least once I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m15s)



[understood what I was doing there was a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m18s)



[little bit of trial and error that had](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m20s)



[to go along with it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m21s)



[but for the most part things were pretty](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m22s)



[simple and straightforward so when you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m25s)



[first fire up and create a new logic app](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m27s)



[you can go through they've got a whole](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m30s)



[bunch of pre-built templates so for just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m31s)



[sort of a kind of common things that you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m36s)



[might want to do get daily reminders](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m38s)



[email to you you can see there's a whole](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m41s)



[bunch of integrations to various](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m43s)



[services obviously all of the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m45s)



[stuff like what you would expect is all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m48s)



[kind of built in but even things like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m49s)



[Twitter slack YouTube](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m52s)



[Instagram kind of all of those fancy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m54s)



[ones even things like MailChimp and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h10m58s)



[Dropbox and all kinds of all kinds of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m00s)



[cool stuff so so you if if one of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m03s)



[templates looks close to what you want](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m07s)



[or you just kind of want to see an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m08s)



[example of how do I build something out](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m10s)



[and what should the end result look like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m12s)



[go ahead and grab one of these but in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m13s)



[our case we're just gonna start with a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m14s)



[blank template and go from there so this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m15s)



[is sort of where you start and and when](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m19s)



[it dumps you in there's kind of two ways](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m23s)



[to look at this we're in the designer](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m25s)



[view at the moment but we can also look](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m27s)



[at this from the code perspective as](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m29s)



[well if you want to actually see what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m31s)



[it's doing under the hood so in this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m32s)



[case let's go through and I've already](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m36s)



[tied this guy up to my YouTube account](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m39s)



[so I'm gonna just go with this so when I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m42s)



[upload a video and then do to do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m45s)



[hopefully it finds my existing service](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m49s)



[connection should find one sitting there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m51s)



[already I hope otherwise we may just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m53s)



[gonna do this over here real quick cuz I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m57s)



[don't know what it's gonna show a prompt](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h11m59s)



[for I don't quite remember oh just basic](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m01s)



[oh oh off screens all the way through so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m05s)



[log yourself in and it'll build a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m07s)



[service connection through you for you I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m09s)



[betcha it's because my service](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m11s)



[connections in a different resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m13s)



[group anyway so this guy's gonna go out](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m14s)



[and pull my YouTube account for my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m17s)



[videos to watch when I've uploaded a new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m21s)



[video and you can control the frequency](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m23s)



[there's an interval you can have it go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m25s)



[minutes seconds hours days and pull](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m27s)



[through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m31s)



[I know YouTube has rate limiting so I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m32s)



[suspect that there's probably a rate](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m34s)



[that you can set that's too fast](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m37s)



[but in my case something simple like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m39s)



[maybe once an hour is more than](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m41s)



[sufficient for what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m44s)



[and then this is where things start to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m46s)



[get really fun so from here once we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m48s)



[upload a video now we can do something](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m51s)



[with it so for something simple we'll](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m53s)



[just say let's just let's just send an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m56s)



[email](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m57s)



[yes send email great once again it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h12m58s)



[gonna make me go through my OAuth stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m01s)



[just gonna drop this window over on my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m03s)



[second monitor real quick](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m05s)



[and I'm just gonna click through yes yes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m06s)



[i authorized as your dev ops yes you can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m09s)



[have access to my account great and so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m12s)



[here let's see let's go through and just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m16s)



[foo bar comm obviously this email isn't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m22s)



[gonna work but then we can start adding](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m25s)



[in parameter so you know you probably](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m27s)



[want a subject line body and there's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m29s)



[other choices but those are those are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m32s)



[the interesting ones so let's say so a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m33s)



[new video Wow video uploaded okay](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m36s)



[alright and now and now we get to start](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m43s)



[having fun because you'll notice over on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m44s)



[this right here there's dynamic content](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m46s)



[so the previous connector this YouTube](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m49s)



[connector has a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m52s)



[information that it's flowing through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m54s)



[that we can then go through and pull the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m56s)



[information out of to say okay what am i](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h13m59s)



[interested in my interested in the idea](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m01s)



[of the video you know I probably want to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m03s)



[link you know there's a title at least](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m06s)



[with the the YouTube connector some of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m08s)



[the names just because of the nesting](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m11s)



[get a little weird video list video](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m12s)



[video summary channel ID basically read](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m15s)



[this as the videos channel ID the videos](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m18s)



[channel title the description for the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m20s)



[video the publish date and the title of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m23s)



[the video so the the naming here gets a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m25s)



[little weird but that's basically what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m28s)



[it translates down to you so you might](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m29s)



[put something like just uploaded and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m31s)



[we'll just insert that guy right there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m37s)



[something like watch it here right](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m41s)



[and video web link and that and that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m46s)



[great and this and this is kind of all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m49s)



[fine and good and this is this is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m51s)



[something very simplistic](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m53s)



[and it works really well for just sort](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m54s)



[of automating some workflows but we can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m57s)



[get even more advanced than that so say](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h14m58s)



[we don't want to necessarily just do a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m01s)



[than B then C for example we can then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m02s)



[say okay let's do a parallel branch](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m06s)



[so after this guy's uploaded I can now](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m08s)



[split this off into two different](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m10s)



[effective code branches that I want it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m13s)



[to do and say okay now I actually want](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m16s)



[it to go to maybe my Twitter feed and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m18s)



[say okay let let's now let's now post a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m20s)



[tweet or let's actually rather than](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m23s)



[connecting yet one more account yeah go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m27s)



[ahead and delete it let's go back to put](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m29s)



[that parallel branch back in ah let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m30s)



[see what else what else do we want to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m33s)



[play with to do let's do something like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m34s)



[maybe an azure queue and upload a list](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m40s)



[regardless let's actually switch over](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m44s)



[because I think I'm going to show you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m46s)



[the the logic app that I built sort of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m47s)



[based on this and kind of walk through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m49s)



[it so the the first idea that I had come](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m50s)



[up with for this is there's sort of this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m53s)



[long process that I go through every](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m56s)



[time every time I complete a stream I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h15m58s)



[have to go through export it to YouTube](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m01s)



[add a bunch of information and then you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m02s)



[know do the usual posting and that kind](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m04s)



[of stuff and a lot of times I end up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m06s)



[just skipping you know tweeting out hey](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m08s)



[you know the new video is live and it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m11s)



[like yeah whatever people will find it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m13s)



[and I realized that this would be sort](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m15s)



[of the ideal thing to start automating](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m20s)



[some of those basic processes of you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m22s)



[know what do I want to do with each of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m25s)



[these so for example when I upload a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m26s)



[video it's just gonna pull my account](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m29s)



[every hour which is great and then what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m30s)



[I'm what I'm interested in doing and so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m35s)



[I I tested it out with the email just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m37s)



[that I could see it and verify the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m41s)



[information that was going but there's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m42s)



[basically a prefix message because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m46s)



[there's two times that I upload videos](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m49s)



[to YouTube I'm either recording](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m51s)



[something locally and manually uploading](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m54s)



[it or it's something that I've exported](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m55s)



[from twitch](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m57s)



[and twitch when you export it it tacks](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h16m58s)



[on a little broadcasted on Twitch with a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m01s)



[URL at the bottom of the video](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m03s)



[description so I decided okay well let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m05s)



[let's make some assumptions that if we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m08s)



[see twitch somewhere in the description](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m12s)



[of the video that this video came from](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m15s)



[twitch so in these values in addition to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m17s)



[just taking the straight-up dynamic](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m21s)



[content that you can get you can now](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m22s)



[start to get even more advanced and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m24s)



[start building out functions and you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m26s)



[don't have to necessarily even have just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m29s)



[one value here you can attack multiple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m30s)



[values in here to set set these guys up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m34s)



[so in this case I said okay let's create](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m37s)



[a new message prefix variable it's gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m39s)



[be of type string and let's see I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m43s)



[if we flip over to code view this might](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m46s)



[be a little cleaner to look at so if you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m48s)



[are interested in actually like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m51s)



[downloading the it looks very much arm](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m52s)



[template like of this guy you can do so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m55s)



[here let's see here so post a tweet send](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h17m59s)



[email notification now interested so set](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m03s)



[message prefix so message prefix it's a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m06s)



[variable it's of type string and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m09s)



[it's got this long value condition here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m11s)



[so what this does is it says okay from](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m14s)



[from the trigger body look at snippet](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m17s)



[description which this is the the video](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m19s)



[description from the the previous step](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m21s)



[in here and it says look if it contains](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m25s)



[the word twitch if it does it starts](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m28s)



[with the message prefix twitch stream](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m31s)



[posted to YouTube and otherwise it just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m34s)



[says new video posted to YouTube great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m37s)



[fine wonderful the next variable that we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m39s)



[go through and initialize was going](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m42s)



[through and actually setting up tags](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m44s)



[because ultimately what I'm looking to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m46s)



[do is tweet out and say hey you know new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m47s)



[new video posted etc and so what I went](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m53s)



[through and did and said okay if the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m56s)



[description also contains something](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h18m59s)



[about material design I'm going to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m00s)



[assume that it's one of the videos about](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m02s)



[the material design in zamel library and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m06s)



[I'm going to go through and just attach](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m08s)



[a whole bunch of the normal prefixes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m09s)



[that I normally do to it and so you'll](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m11s)



[know this is one long string that I've](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m13s)



[just comma separated all right let's go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m15s)



[back up to not email we'll look at the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m18s)



[Twitter one so post a tweet right so it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m22s)



[comes through and for the tweet text it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m25s)



[grabs the message prefix variable puts](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m27s)



[period on the end of it for the end of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m30s)



[the sentence](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m32s)



[it then goes through and grabs the the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m32s)



[link to the YouTube video here and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m39s)



[it goes all the way back and it goes and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m43s)



[grabs this variable for tags splits on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m46s)



[the commas and then tacks a bunch of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m49s)



[spaces on now I could have gone through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m50s)



[and saved myself a little bit of trouble](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m53s)



[avoiding this kind of split and join and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m56s)



[just tack the string indirectly the way](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h19m59s)



[the way that it needed to be but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m02s)



[ultimately I was I was trying to look at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m04s)



[this as I may want to add some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m06s)



[additional steps where I append more](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m09s)



[things or remove items from it and so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m11s)



[thinking of playing with this there's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m15s)



[also array types and sort of a lot of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m17s)



[those built-in primitives that you are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m19s)



[used to that you can go through and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m20s)



[build and there are tons of API](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m23s)



[connectors let's jump back over here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m25s)



[because there was one other thing I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m27s)



[wanted to show that I didn't get to so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m28s)



[so this is kind of the for you all this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m31s)



[stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m33s)



[the built-in one this is what really](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m34s)



[impressed me is you can do all kinds of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m36s)



[stuff so one you can just do straight-up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m39s)



[inline code it's JavaScript I believe](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m41s)



[where you're basically acting on the the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m44s)



[JSON payload with access to all of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m47s)



[variables and everything like you need](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m50s)



[the other steps kit so if you just want](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m52s)



[a straight inline some code to build one](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m53s)



[of these logic apps you can totally do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m55s)



[it here you can shell out too as your](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h20m57s)



[functions HTTP calls you can call in to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m00s)



[your own web services and if you have a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m04s)



[web service that outputs an open API](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m08s)



[will used to be called a swagger doc you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m10s)



[can use that to build up your own](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m13s)



[logic app connectors so that you can now](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m16s)



[start tying these things together all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m19s)



[kinds of stuff there's the the basic](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m23s)



[programming logic so conditional control](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m26s)



[flow so your if-then-else statements for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m29s)



[each is for iterating you've got switch](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m33s)



[statements loop until all kinds of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m35s)



[basic date/time functions as you saw](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m40s)



[before there's sort of the normal](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m42s)



[functions that you would expect for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m45s)



[manipulating data built into them a lot](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m47s)



[of data transforms there's also really](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m50s)



[useful apps in here for doing things on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m53s)



[like scheduling and delay and batching](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m56s)



[and that kind of thing so if you have a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h21m59s)



[simple request where you just need to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m01s)



[basically batch a bunch of messages and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m03s)



[do retry logic that works all of these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m05s)



[steps have built in too so for example](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m08s)



[here if we pull this guy and do settings](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m12s)



[so there is dealing with timeouts retry](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m16s)



[policies because obviously especially](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m20s)



[when you're calling external web](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m23s)



[services things don't always work it'd](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m25s)



[be nice if the internet was perfect it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m28s)



[rarely is so it has all of that kind of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m29s)



[stuff built in for you you can go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m32s)



[through and do if you have multiple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m35s)



[steps you can actually tell it let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m40s)



[jump back over here something where I've](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m44s)



[got a few more things built up so for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m46s)



[example on these things you can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m49s)



[configure run after to say that I only](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m51s)



[want this step to run if the previous](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m53s)



[one was successful which is the default](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m56s)



[because you know if one of these guys](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m57s)



[fails up here for any reason these ones](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h22m59s)



[never get invoked because by default](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m02s)



[everything only runs if the previous](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m04s)



[stuff was successful but you can have it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m06s)



[run one fail or if there was a timeout](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m08s)



[or if there is a skip so you can someone](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m11s)



[get that conditional logic built in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m12s)



[there as well so I think these things](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m14s)



[are awesome I'm having a lot of fun with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m17s)



[them my plan is to go through and try to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m19s)



[start automating as much of my my life](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m22s)



[as I can with these things because they](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m24s)



[are really cool](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m26s)



[and fairly cheap to run on Azure from](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m28s)



[what I've seen I've had this guy just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m30s)



[sort of pinging my stuff for a couple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m33s)



[days and I think it's cost me about](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m36s)



[three cents so they are obviously](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m38s)



[depends on what you're doing but they](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m41s)



[can be really cheap to run and they are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m42s)



[really kind of cool to be able to build](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m44s)



[up the one thing I've heard is some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m48s)



[people kind of find them to be a little](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m49s)



[gimmicky and don't really you know the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m52s)



[whole click and drag and oh look I've](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m55s)



[got pretty arrows and boxes it doesn't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m57s)



[really feel like enterprise great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h23m58s)



[software this is enterprise grade](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m00s)



[software this stuff works and it's and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m03s)



[it works really really well so take a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m06s)



[look at it especially if you've got some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m10s)



[workflows or things where it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m11s)



[essentially moving data around or kind](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m13s)



[of pulling retry logic this kind of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m16s)



[stuff can really help smooth over some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m19s)



[of those rough edges where you know a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m21s)



[lot of times you end up kind of writing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m23s)



[those simple one-off apps to just do one](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m24s)



[little task so that's where I was going](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m28s)



[with logic apps again I think these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m31s)



[things are awesome if other people like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m33s)



[them great if there's something that you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m35s)



[think would be cool to build let me know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m39s)



[in the comments I sort of had an idea of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m40s)



[building out an automatic tweet machine](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m43s)



[like there's different services like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m48s)



[Twitter that will go through and let you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m50s)



[schedule your tweets so you can have](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m52s)



[things go out on a predefined schedule I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m54s)



[was thinking of basically trying to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m57s)



[build the same thing out with a logic](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h24m59s)



[app because it seemed like that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m00s)



[exactly what this thing could do really](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m03s)



[well so if that's interesting to people](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m05s)



[and you'd like to see that let me know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m08s)



[because I I was thinking it might be a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m09s)



[fun little thing to build because it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m12s)



[actually something that I would start](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m14s)



[using right away](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m16s)



[cool so with that said let's head back](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m18s)



[to material design](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m22s)



[we are going to get going so the 300](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m26s)



[milestone is still sort of chugging](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m30s)



[along again my my hope and plan is to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m32s)



[try and release that release this 300](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m34s)



[release later this month ideally right](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m38s)



[along the same time dotnet core three](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m41s)



[releases so that is the game plan and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m44s)



[the hope so just be aware that that is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m47s)



[hopefully coming what I may end up doing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m53s)



[since a lot of the the key issues for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m56s)



[300 have been resolved I suspect this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h25m59s)



[whole list may not necessarily get](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m02s)



[resolved in time and so some of these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m04s)



[items may get bumped into a 301 it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m06s)



[also worth noting that people who are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m09s)



[using the Maps integration I I don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m11s)



[think the Maps integration package with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m14s)



[dotnet core will be ready to go when](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m17s)



[this 300 package releases so this will](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m20s)



[be a three oh release of material design](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m23s)



[and zamel proper so it'll just be the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m25s)

[apps 2o drops just to make my life a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m37s)



[little bit easier because right now to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m40s)



[support dotnet core would require](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m43s)



[targeting there to o preview package but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m47s)



[now that has breaking changes with the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m50s)



[165 current release and so trying to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m52s)



[support both of those inside of our one](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m54s)



[package is doable but it's a lot of work](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h26m57s)



[and a bit of a hassle when I could just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m01s)



[drag my feet a little bit and wait for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m03s)



[their 202 drop and then add support so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m05s)



[if you're wanting to jump into dotnet](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m07s)



[core right away and you're hoping to use](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m11s)



[this with my apps please be patient and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m13s)



[give me a little bit of time but know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m16s)



[that it will be coming very quickly on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m18s)



[the heels so going through and looking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m21s)



[at this there was a couple issues in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m25s)



[particular that I wanted to jump in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m26s)



[address and the first one is this 1357](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m29s)



[so there is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m32s)



[unfortunately because I run resharper I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m35s)



[missed this when the to 600 release went](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m38s)



[out the door](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m42s)



[so with two 6-0 we added a new way of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m42s)



[doing theming I'll pop the wiki open to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m45s)



[show show real quick is before in your](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m48s)



[app dot zamel there was a bunch of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m50s)



[different resource dictionaries that you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m53s)



[needed to go through an ad to make sure](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m55s)



[that you brought in all of the colors](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m57s)



[does this show the old one to do yeah so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h27m59s)



[you'd end up with a an apt out sample](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m04s)



[that looked kind of like this and and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m07s)



[this isn't bad you just have to know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m10s)



[that okay here's where my primary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m12s)



[is here's where my accent color is and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m14s)



[you can set these up these then did](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m16s)



[limit you to just the built in colors](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m19s)



[and didn't allow for a lot of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m21s)



[customization and that's what we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m22s)



[addressed in the to 600 release so with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m25s)



[to six oh you can now go through and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m28s)



[make your that same app dogs Amal that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m31s)



[we just saw you can do it like this and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m34s)



[this ends up with the exact same result](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m37s)



[you still need to add the merged](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m40s)



[resource dictionary for the built-in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m43s)



[styles to make sure that you know all of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m45s)



[your controls get the material design](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m48s)



[look and feel to them but then when it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m51s)



[comes to colors you can just grab the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m53s)



[bundled theme and it then has a few](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m55s)



[properties on it that you can set for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m58s)



[light primarycolour secondarycolour and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h28m59s)



[these will go through this is just a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m03s)



[markup extension that returns a new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m05s)



[resource dictionary with all of these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m07s)



[settings pre-populated for you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m10s)



[now the the problem that comes is Visual](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m12s)



[Studio is not hip to the idea that this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m16s)



[markup extension return is a resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m18s)



[dictionary so let's go take a look at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m21s)



[that real quick](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m23s)



[bundled themed boom so this is just a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m26s)



[markup extension and you'll notice it is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m34s)



[decorated with the attribute to say that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m36s)



[yes this does in fact return a new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m39s)



[resource dictionary its provide value](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m40s)



[method does go through and create a new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m43s)



[resource dictionary and pre-populates](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m44s)



[that resource dictionary with all of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m47s)



[appropriate theme brushes now](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m49s)



[unfortunately if you do this and you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m50s)



[don't have something like resharper](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m54s)



[running the visual studio designer](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m55s)



[whines and complains with a warning](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h29m57s)



[saying that oh this the only thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m00s)



[inside of a merged dictionary collection](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m03s)



[is in fact resource dictionaries which](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m06s)



[is true except for this markup extension](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m09s)



[does in fact return a resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m11s)



[dictionary so what this pull request](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m13s)



[does is it goes through and changes the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m17s)



[bundled theme markup extension to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m22s)



[itself a resource dictionary that then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m25s)



[you can go through and set the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m28s)



[properties on and then it goes through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m30s)



[and builds up and basically does the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m34s)



[same work that the markup extension was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m37s)



[doing so the there's a couple small](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m39s)



[issues with this that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m43s)



[address but I think this is going to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m45s)



[the first one that we try to get in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m46s)



[because I if this feels like the type of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m48s)



[issue that's a bit of a regression and I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m52s)



[do try to prioritize those types of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m55s)



[issues above the other ones so pull](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h30m58s)



[requests 1357 let's go grab I've got I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m02s)



[really got to clean this out let's see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m08s)



[let's just start collapsing some stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m10s)



[up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m11s)



[so 1357 this guy here and go-go-gadget](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m12s)



[check out pull request there we go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m20s)



[fix custom themes so let's see two](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m25s)



[commits theme markup extension and the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m30s)



[markup extension so all in the one file](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m34s)



[great great great great great great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m36s)



[great great yep so we're probably gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m39s)



[I'm probably going to do a few things](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m44s)



[here what are you thinking about here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m46s)



[like modification yeah I changed](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m50s)



[branches please reload](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h31m54s)



[it's probably a little unhappy that I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m00s)



[did this on top of oh it's because we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m04s)



[change from the old CS pouch to the new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m09s)



[CS proj let's just ignore let's shut](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m10s)



[down I think the first thing we're going](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m14s)



[to do is just move this real quick and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m17s)



[let's just replay this a rebase this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m24s)



[right on top a master real quick great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m28s)



[so that moves up wonderful wonderful](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m34s)



[wonderful and now we have all the latest](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m38s)



[stuff great that's what we wanted I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m42s)



[didn't think there were any changes that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m45s)



[should have conflicted with that so that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m47s)



[makes it easy fire this guy back up and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m49s)



[now Visual Studio should be happier](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m52s)



[there there's a weird kind of catch-22](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m53s)



[right now since we switched to the new](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m57s)



[CS proj format when you change branches](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h32m59s)



[going back and forth Visual Studio is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m02s)



[not always happy about having the new CS](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m04s)



[project out from under it and replaced](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m08s)



[with the old one and vice-versa so the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m10s)



[new CS projects wonderful it does the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m13s)



[hot reload so much better but when](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m15s)



[you're going back and forth between the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m17s)



[two it could be a bit of a pain](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m19s)



[sometimes you just got to throw in the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m21s)



[towel and restart your visual studio but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m23s)



[it is a problem that will eventually go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m27s)



[away as things move forward and I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m31s)



[stopped having to go back to old commits](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m33s)



[okay so let's go and pick this guy up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m36s)



[so that's the markup extension and I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m41s)



[should probably break this guy up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m47s)



[because these guys really should be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m51s)



[broken up into their own their own files](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h33m55s)



[so so I like this change here of doing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m03s)



[the bundle thing in into the resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m07s)



[dictionary I think I'm not going to keep](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m09s)



[around the markup extension there's not](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m12s)



[a lot of reason to to keep the markup](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m14s)



[extension if we have the resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m17s)



[dictionary and I think it would just add](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m19s)



[confusion technically switching from the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m20s)



[this type name down here is a breaking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m24s)



[change but as far as your zamel is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m27s)



[concerned for anybody who's already](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m30s)



[switched over come on come on Chrome you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m32s)



[can do it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m35s)



[if yours Amal looks like this because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m36s)



[the names are gonna line up and the name](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m38s)



[space is still gonna match it'll work](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m41s)



[just fine for you so if you were doing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m43s)



[something fancy where maybe you derived](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m45s)



[from one of these classes just be aware](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m46s)



[that this change is coming and it is a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m48s)



[breaking change but I am okay with this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m52s)



[breaking change if it makes the code a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m55s)



[lot easier to use so we have all of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h34m58s)



[these properties and a call to set theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m01s)



[on each of these after each one is done](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m05s)



[because before with the markup extension](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m09s)



[we had a concept of provide value so we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m12s)



[could get invoked after all of our](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m15s)



[properties were set with this one no](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m17s)



[such luck](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m21s)



[so I think we're gonna change a couple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m24s)



[things here yeah so that is that is true](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m25s)



[there and I I think the first thing I'm](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m32s)



[gonna change is making each of these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m36s)



[enums nillable because I do want to have](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m43s)



[a concept of whether these have been set](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m46s)



[or not and if they haven't been set we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m48s)



[can avoid doing some lookups this by](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m52s)



[making them non nullable they're gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m54s)



[drop through to their default values and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m56s)



[that looks like an opportunity for some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h35m59s)



[confusion to arise so I think again I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m03s)



[like I like how this was done this is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m07s)



[this is roughly the direction I would be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m10s)



[going but I think what we're gonna do is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m12s)



[start tweaking this just a little bit](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m15s)



[because knowing knowing when these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m20s)



[values have actually been set and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m22s)



[appropriately updating the resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m25s)



[dictionary I believe is a good idea so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m27s)



[let's see theme create theme set theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m31s)



[I'm wondering if we should be augmenting](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m36s)



[the existing theme rather than just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m39s)



[throwing it away every time](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m40s)



[because I think we can change up these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m47s)



[property setters to the other thing that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m48s)



[we want to do is we don't want to always](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m51s)



[blindly just set theme it's a more of an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m53s)



[edge case but in general if you've got a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h36m56s)



[property set up like this you want to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m00s)



[make sure that you aren't doing the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m02s)



[expensive work if the property hasn't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m04s)



[actually changed okay so this is yeah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m07s)



[that's gonna cause that's gonna cause](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m11s)



[some problems so let's let's just start](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m13s)



[with like primary color and I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m15s)



[we'll come on what are you doing there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m19s)



[you go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m21s)



[so if primary color not equal to value](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m22s)



[then we'll actually do then we'll](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m33s)



[actually do work all right so then we'll](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m35s)



[set it and I think let's see here I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m38s)



[think we can do this yet theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m48s)



[extract the current theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h37m54s)



[I'm curious what this is gonna do if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m02s)



[there is no theme there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m07s)



[I don't recall let's see so if it has an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m09s)



[existing theme it knows how to grab it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m14s)



[and jump out otherwise it's gonna try](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m16s)



[and look it up which isn't gonna play](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m19s)



[nice not gonna play nice with the other](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m23s)



[kids](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m26s)



[because we're gonna need to actually set](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m30s)



[the theme in the first place](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m32s)



[maybe we should just blindly set the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m38s)



[theme on all the cases](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m40s)



[that would make it easier](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m44s)



[let's go back to that maybe we go-oh](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m51s)



[with this theme approach still I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m54s)



[we still add these basic checks and all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h38m57s)



[over these again I suspect that most](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m00s)



[people are probably not going through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m03s)



[calling these setters a bunch and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m05s)



[passing identical values but it's still](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m07s)



[better practice to go through and and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m11s)



[handle that case and not be wasteful](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m13s)



[then do that do that make sure thank you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m21s)



[that was a little bit too much of a jump](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m31s)



[we've got the same one with the custom](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m33s)



[color down below as well so secondary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m36s)



[color gets the value something like that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m38s)



[then we'll call set theme okay so that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m43s)



[one's done that one's done that one's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m49s)



[done so I think then what we do is if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m51s)



[base theme is base theme so for those](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h39m56s)



[people not familiar with it this is roof](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m04s)



[is the new pattern matching syntax that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m06s)



[came came to us in c-sharp 7 it also so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m10s)



[in this case I'm just using the pattern](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m17s)



[match is basically a null check and an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m19s)



[assignment all boiled into one so if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m22s)



[this thing is not null then it will be a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m25s)



[base theme and it'll set the local](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m27s)



[variable base theme so it's a it's a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m29s)



[quick and easy way to get a null](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m32s)



[checking assignment all together primary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m34s)



[color is primary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m37s)



[same thing there and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h40m44s)



[and I'm wondering if I should make all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m00s)



[of these because this is effectively](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m02s)



[making all of these properties required](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m04s)



[because these guys had fall backs](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m16s)



[I don't I think we do make them all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m30s)



[required and if you don't set all of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m35s)



[them then you end up not getting your](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m38s)



[theme set and I think that probably](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m39s)



[makes sense to avoid having the the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m41s)



[theme set if you haven't actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m44s)



[specified these there there's enough](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m47s)



[Styles throughout the library where the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m48s)



[primary and secondary colors are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m51s)



[required and if you haven't specified](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m53s)



[one you're gonna get a very odd-looking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m55s)



[control because then you get an unset](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h41m57s)



[brush which effectively goes down to you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m00s)



[transparent which isn't isn't really](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m03s)



[helpful so I think we're gonna go with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m05s)



[that if people have strong opinions](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m08s)



[about how you think the bundled theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m09s)



[should work let me know but I think at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m12s)



[least for now since we already are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m16s)



[making a breaking change we're gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m19s)



[make a big behavioral breaking change as](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m21s)



[well so so now this guy here we can use](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m24s)



[our local variable base theme because we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m29s)



[now know it's no longer knowable same](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m32s)



[thing for both of these primary and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m34s)



[secondary colors](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m37s)



[this will create us up a new theme so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m39s)



[base theme is expected to either be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m41s)



[light or dark primary and secondary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m43s)



[colors are going to be one of the enum](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m45s)



[values so all of the built-in themes are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m48s)



[red pink purple etc etc etc as everyone](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m51s)



[knows purple is best](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m56s)



[okay so that handles the the bundled](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h42m59s)



[theme here this set theme I don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m02s)



[understand what this is here for I know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m08s)



[this existed previously in the markup](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m13s)



[extension hey exotic funk how are you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m15s)



[doing I don't think we needed here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m18s)



[though I may decide that we do need it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m22s)



[after we get to the MA apps one doing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m27s)



[good just trying to get some of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m30s)



[material design hole request done and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m33s)



[merged in so if you are a WPF developer](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m37s)



[and interested in material design](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m40s)



[welcome it's great to have you or if you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m42s)



[just like C sharp or like me just enjoy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m44s)



[coding either one though it is a it is a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m47s)



[little bit late for me and I'm I still](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m51s)



[have to do some grocery shopping here in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m53s)



[a couple hours at midnight so it'll be a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m55s)



[long night](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h43m58s)



[oh cool where are you studying I assume](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m03s)



[computer science](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m06s)



[I'm gonna make](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m14s)



[we're gonna make the same no ability](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m16s)



[checks here cool](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m18s)



[that's awesome how far along in your](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m26s)



[school are you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m28s)



[let's see sonal ability there and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m34s)



[that's just three weeks you liking it so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m38s)



[far doing some homework well hopefully](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m42s)



[I'm not too distracting but I have to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m47s)



[say I've been I've been doing this for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m51s)



[12 years now and I have never regretted](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m53s)



[my decision to go into computer science](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h44m57s)



[I it was not initially what I was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m01s)



[planning on doing but once I got got in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m03s)



[and trying it I had a professor that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m06s)



[very much hooked me on it so after that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m09s)



[I was basically said okay so in the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m13s)



[interest of consistency we're going to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m18s)



[rename this guy to set theme as well](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m20s)



[because even though it's a private](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m24s)



[method I like my api's to be consistent](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m26s)



[cool](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m33s)



[yeah C++ is actually it's a little bit](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m35s)



[harder language to get going on so if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m38s)



[you make it through the first class and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m40s)



[you're still enjoying it you probably](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m41s)



[have a winner right there so don't don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m43s)



[feel too bad if you seem a little lost](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m47s)



[especially with C and C++ there's a lot](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m50s)



[of fundamentals that really get hammered](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m54s)



[home with those so things like memory](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m57s)



[management and pointers especially do be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h45m59s)



[aware that there are other languages](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m05s)



[that operated a little bit higher level](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m07s)



[that don't make you deal with some of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m09s)



[those nitty-gritty details so for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m11s)



[example c-sharp what you see me using](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m14s)



[here is my preferred language of choice](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m17s)



[you don't quite have to deal with things](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m19s)



[like pointers and memory management](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m22s)



[directly but it's those types of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m24s)



[concepts still very much exists and you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m27s)



[can't really abandon those fundamentals](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m30s)



[so if you are like I said if you MIT if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m32s)



[you make it through the first class and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m36s)



[you're still enjoying it it's probably](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m37s)



[definitely a winner I said I I very much](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m38s)



[enjoy programming I can't say that I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m41s)



[remember a lot of my C++ I haven't done](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m44s)



[a lot of it since I graduated because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m50s)



[once I graduated I got a job doing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m55s)



[c-sharp where I went to school Java was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h46m59s)



[the big language that they that they](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m03s)



[taught most of the classes in and so I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m05s)



[had a little bit of a background in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m08s)



[vb.net and Java and they're like well](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m10s)



[just put those two things together and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m12s)



[you've got c-sharp that's not quite true](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m14s)



[but it was close enough and so once I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m16s)



[got going on it I I fell in love with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m19s)



[the language very quickly](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m21s)



[let's see we will do the same difference](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m25s)



[checks on all of these to make sure that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m28s)



[we don't accidentally create the theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m30s)



[too many times to do okay so see primary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m31s)



[secondary I think that's it is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m40s)



[interesting I'm noticing that I've](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m45s)



[somewhat changed my API and and I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m48s)



[realized this was exactly what it was in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m50s)



[the old code the bundled theme is using](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m52s)



[primary color and this one's just called](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m55s)



[primary I'm thinking I want to change](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h47m59s)



[these yeah and actually especially if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m05s)



[you're learning programming I would](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m11s)



[encourage you if there's any projects](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m13s)



[that seem interesting to you the best](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m16s)



[way to learn is to find something that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m18s)



[you want to build and try to build it I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m21s)



[find that that's where I've actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m24s)



[learned the most going through school](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m26s)



[taught me a lot of the fundamentals and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m28s)



[sort of how to get going but sort of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m30s)



[most of my learning came from side](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m33s)



[projects and just saying you know I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m37s)



[really wish I had a program that did X](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m39s)



[or I want to figure out how to make my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m42s)



[computer do you know why and go through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m44s)



[and build that out building based on on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m46s)



[what you love or something that you're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m49s)



[interested in I find that it's a whole](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m51s)



[lot easier to retain that kind of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m54s)



[information](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m56s)



[I'm actually supposed to be teaching at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h48m59s)



[one of the local universities here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m03s)



[coming up in a couple weeks so at least](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m05s)



[where I'm at the university start a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m07s)



[little late in the year so it'll be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m10s)



[it'll be fun it'll be just an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m13s)



[introduction to c-sharp class with me](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m15s)



[and a couple coworkers but let's see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m17s)



[what are you trying to rename so that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m20s)



[symbols fine I expect that that symbols](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m23s)



[fine okay do it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m27s)



[and we're gonna let some of these this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m37s)



[is gonna this is gonna break the demo](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m40s)



[app but I think I'm okay with it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m41s)



[breaking right now because I kind of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m43s)



[want to go through and evaluate the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m45s)



[usages of these properties to make sure](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m46s)



[I get them right so I think I'll have to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m49s)



[put a note in to go through and update](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m54s)



[the wiki for this change because this is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m55s)



[definitely going to make my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h49m59s)



[documentation wrong and always the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m00s)



[hardest thing trying to keep the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m04s)



[documentation in sync so you notice down](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m06s)



[here there was a similar null check that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m08s)



[was being done on these but I think I'm](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m11s)



[gonna switch this out for the same](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m13s)



[pattern matching don't worry about the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m14s)



[string literals don't worry about those](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m17s)



[string literals we'll go through and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m20s)



[deal with those in a minute okay so I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m22s)



[think the same type of thing here but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m25s)



[because we've named these things the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m27s)



[same I'm just gonna cheat I can copy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m29s)



[this code right here bring this down hey](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m32s)



[paste thank you no one pasted](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m37s)



[Kotick at would you say code Academy is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m44s)



[a good site to learn a little bit more](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m46s)



[besides class lectures and books yes so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m48s)



[I've only used them a little bit when I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m52s)



[was going through school they weren't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m55s)



[really a thing and so I didn't have](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m57s)



[access to them but I have gone through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h50m59s)



[and referred other people to some of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m01s)



[courses I could not it's it's been a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m05s)



[while since I've looked at their stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m08s)



[but the last time I did it was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m10s)



[definitely good information I guess the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m12s)



[the big question is are you just looking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m19s)



[for more information on learning C++ or](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m22s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m26s)



[programming in general or different](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m27s)



[frameworks or I guess what are you most](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m29s)



[interested in learning let's see here so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m31s)



[switch these guys over this is going to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m36s)



[be color properties now rather than](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m38s)



[rather than enums so switch those and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m42s)



[then these guys become straight-up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m46s)



[primary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m52s)



[lost in class of trying to catch up yeah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h51m56s)



[so I would say definitely codecademy if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m00s)



[you know what the the lectures were over](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m03s)



[that you missed the the hard part is on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m05s)



[the internet there is a lot of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m11s)



[information that can be old and outdated](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m12s)



[usually stuff for the the basic](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m17s)



[fundamentals isn't too bad but just be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m19s)



[aware there's there's sort of a running](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m23s)



[joke that a lot of new programmers copy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m25s)



[and paste code from the internet without](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m30s)



[actually understanding and so just be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m31s)



[aware of that it's it's always a trap to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m35s)



[just copy code that you see without](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m38s)



[actually understanding exactly what it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m40s)



[doing so so always make sure that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m42s)



[anything that you bring in from the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m45s)



[outside that you're you're clear on what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m46s)



[it is and what it should do but yeah at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m49s)



[least for like the fundamental stuff I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m52s)



[would say something like code Academy is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m54s)



[probably a great place to start okay so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m55s)



[once again we're gonna just whack the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h52m59s)



[empty constructor because default](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m01s)



[constructor comes built-in with every](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m03s)



[class unless you specify one I don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m05s)



[think we need the set theme that's I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m08s)



[believe leftover from them when it was a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m10s)



[markup extension custom color theme and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m11s)



[we're just gonna whack the markup](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m15s)



[extension and I think we can kill these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m16s)



[comments because those type of comments](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m20s)



[quickly become dated](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m23s)



[working on constants and inputs ah so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m28s)



[let's see so if it's if so some of that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m34s)



[will just be understanding the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m39s)



[appropriate syntax for what you're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m41s)



[trying to do declaring a constant and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m43s)



[what exactly a constant is as the name](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m47s)



[implies spoiler alert it just means a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m50s)



[value that's fixed and will never change](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m54s)



[as far as dealing with input basically](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h53m59s)



[building out console apps are very](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m03s)



[common a lot of people who who teach](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m04s)



[favor them because they they tend to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m08s)



[simple enough that you can hammer home](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m11s)



[the the fundamental programming concepts](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m13s)



[without getting overloaded with you know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m15s)



[full frameworks and that kind of stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m18s)



[to build out like windows and buttons](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m20s)



[and that kind of thing trying to think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m23s)



[so dealing with input if I can remember](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m27s)



[right with C++ I think it's C in is the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m31s)



[default function for just pulling stuff](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m35s)



[in off the command line you'll find a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m38s)



[lot of information that also duplicates](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m39s)



[oh good I do remember something yes it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m43s)



[been a decade but something is still](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m47s)



[stuck in my head](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m49s)



[yeah standard seeing basically if I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m51s)



[remember correctly that will take the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m55s)



[users input off your terminal and bring](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h54m57s)



[it into a string value that then you can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m02s)



[do work with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m04s)



[and it's it's one of those areas that is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m07s)



[ripe for issues the because once you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m11s)



[bring a string in from the user because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m17s)



[you know you could ask the user to enter](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m19s)



[a number and then you know they type in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m20s)



[the letter A okay great and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m23s)



[understanding sort of what is a string a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m26s)



[group of characters and then how do i](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m29s)



[process that input and do new conditions](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m31s)



[on it and that kind of thing so if your](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m34s)



[only three weeks in I know at least when](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m37s)



[we teach we don't usually expect](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m39s)



[students to to deal with a lot of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m41s)



[failure cases right out the gate but it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m43s)



[is something that we definitely hammer](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m46s)



[home throughout the classes that I teach](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m48s)



[because dealing with failure cases is a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m50s)



[huge part of programming](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m54s)



[let's see so we don't need that don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h55m59s)



[need that I'm liking this change already](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m01s)



[less code is usually better code it does](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m03s)



[mean that these things need to change](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m06s)



[the file that they're in do use Minear](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m08s)



[for classwork or homework I don't know](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m15s)



[what that is so no when we do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m20s)



[assignments so I'm not actually a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m23s)



[teacher by trade I am a software](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m28s)



[developer in my day job](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m32s)



[so for a homework we try to keep our](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m34s)



[stuff as close to real world as we can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m38s)



[so everything goes through github we do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m40s)



[pull requests for our assignments a lot](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m43s)



[of times it can be a little intimidating](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m47s)



[for some students because in addition to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m49s)



[learning a new language we're also](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m51s)



[throwing things like source control and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m53s)



[get at them to try and make them learn](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m55s)



[but it it matches what we expect from](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h56m58s)



[people working in industry and so the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m02s)



[end goal is usually students coming out](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m07s)



[with a much better understanding of of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m09s)



[how things actually work](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m11s)



[let's see rename file to match type name](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m13s)



[okay so now we've got bundle themes yes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m17s)



[custom color theme CS](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m19s)



[these guys go through here okay so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m26s)



[that's that's a little bit better so two](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m29s)



[new files two new classes and both of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m31s)



[these guys work a little nicer okay so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m36s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m40s)



[let's see here unit test first or my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m43s)



[apps first see when I'm in class I'm](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m46s)



[pretty lost when I when I look at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m51s)



[YouTube or you think start making sense](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m53s)



[well I'm flattered that things make](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m57s)



[sense when I talk because I can't always](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h57m59s)



[claim that I understand what I'm saying](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m01s)



[but I'm glad to hear it and yeah a lot](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m03s)



[of people learn sort of at different](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m06s)



[rates and in different ways and so if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m08s)



[something like going back over YouTube](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m12s)



[videos or reap arcing information works](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m16s)



[definitely do it I would say try to try](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m19s)



[to budget your time I remember when I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m23s)



[was in university the the hardest thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m24s)



[for me was making sure that I budgeted](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m26s)



[my time accordingly because you've got a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m30s)



[lot of classes a lot of homework and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m32s)



[trying to figure out you know okay how](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m34s)



[do i how do I get at least what I need](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m36s)



[done for this class and not fail the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m38s)



[other class so I get it it's it's hard](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m39s)



[but if you can try to budget time to go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m42s)



[back through some other videos to try to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m45s)



[make sure you learn those concepts so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m47s)



[it's a little intimidating yeah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m52s)



[is this were at the University you're at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h58m56s)



[is this one of the like starting classes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m00s)



[for a lot of computer science students](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m03s)



[or is it are they expecting that some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m05s)



[students have come in with like a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m07s)



[different programming class or some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m09s)



[prior experience](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m12s)



[ah Wow](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m15s)



[okay that's like I said C++ is a bit of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m20s)



[a bear language to start with but again](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m25s)



[like I said if you make it through the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m28s)



[first class and you're still loving it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m30s)



[you you probably have a winner there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m31s)



[because the language is usually only get](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m34s)



[easier from there more popular languages](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m38s)



[that people tend to do a lot of our Java](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m43s)



[Python C sharp again my language of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m44s)



[choice even something like if you do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m48s)



[mobile applications with like Kotlin](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m52s)



[objective-c or Swift they tend to be a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m54s)



[little bit better objective-c isn't much](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m58s)



[better than C++ it's a little better](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=00h59m59s)



[they've got some automatic reference](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m03s)



[counting for memory management that kind](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m05s)



[of thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m07s)



[it's just really wordy and weird to look](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m08s)



[at I like things like this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m11s)



[okay I think we're gonna go into let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m18s)



[do the unit test because this was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m22s)



[something that I failed to unit test the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m24s)



[first time and we should we should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m26s)



[definitely unit test it the second time](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m29s)



[around so let's let's go through and add](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m31s)



[the unit test so in it's a bad](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m34s)



[programmer I should have started with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m38s)



[the unit test first and gone the other](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m39s)



[way but I got carried away](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m41s)



[muddled theme yes and we'll end up doing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m46s)



[something similar for the custom color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m51s)



[theme as well and I've already forgotten](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m53s)



[whatever what am i using is this a miss](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h00m58s)



[test X unit that's right okay I work on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m01s)



[too many projects I get confused as far](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m05s)



[as what framework I'm supposed to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m07s)



[using so let's see I think for a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m08s)



[resource dictionary I don't need an sta](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m12s)



[threads so I think I can just do a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m15s)



[simple one avoid actually let's do it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m17s)



[let's do this as a theory so there are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m25s)



[two types of unit tests that are out](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m30s)



[there there are your basic unit test](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m33s)



[which is just public void you know write](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m36s)



[write the code and then there's another](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m39s)



[type of unit test called a data-driven](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m41s)



[unit test void](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m43s)



[when value is missing theme is not set](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m49s)



[great I should probably go through the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m56s)



[unit test at some point and figure out](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h01m58s)



[and make sure I've got a common naming](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m01s)



[pattern because I work on enough](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m03s)



[projects I get confused as to what my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m05s)



[own naming scheme is for now this will](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m06s)



[work so on X unit so the idea with a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m10s)



[data-driven test is if you just had you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m13s)



[know fact you know you write a test the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m15s)



[test does one thing great you then end](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m18s)



[up repeating it a lot but if you've got](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m20s)



[a test that basically differ by values](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m23s)



[so in our case we've got something like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m26s)



[a base theme alright and we might want](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m28s)



[to test all the values of base theme so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m33s)



[what we can do is we can change this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m36s)



[over to a theory and then X unit has a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m39s)



[whole bunch of different ways of passing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m43s)



[in parameters and I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m45s)



[the the easiest of the options which is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m48s)



[just straight up in line data so I can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m50s)



[do base theme dot light and I can do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m52s)



[dark and I can do inherit and I can do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h02m57s)



[null all right](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m03s)



[the problem is is I kind of want to test](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m06s)



[a lot of cases here right because I want](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m08s)



[to do I want to test the base theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m10s)



[values I want to test let's see it was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m12s)



[primary color I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m18s)



[am I forgetting my enum name nope there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m22s)



[it is it's because it's in the colors](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m25s)



[library not in the primary one let's do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m27s)



[a secondary color secondary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m31s)



[and so it's it's whining at me here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m39s)



[because it realizes that ultimately I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m41s)



[need three values not just one so the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m45s)



[question is do I want to go through and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m51s)



[write out because you don't have to do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m56s)



[inline data on all of these you can you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h03m58s)



[can go through and there's other](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m02s)



[attributes that let you basically call a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m04s)



[method and return back these values as](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m06s)



[well](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m09s)



[what are you unhappy about this comma](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m10s)



[expected oh I missed a comma thank you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m14s)



[I think I might just copy and paste](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m19s)



[these lines a few times and get all of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m22s)



[the cases that I'm interested in testing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m24s)



[because I really only care so base theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m25s)



[is the interesting one and actually I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m28s)



[don't even know if I care about I don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m32s)



[think I care about these I really only](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m35s)



[care well she's probably I should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m37s)



[probably check inherit but light and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m40s)



[dark are basically the exact same case](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m41s)



[and I don't need to test all of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m43s)



[values of primary and secondary color I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m45s)



[just need to test has a primary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m46s)



[and no yeah I think that's I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m49s)



[that's what we're going with so let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m54s)



[see do basic unit testing pattern is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h04m56s)



[arranged act assert so we'll do that so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m00s)



[for those people who haven't seen this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m07s)



[before](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m08s)



[a a pattern is very common a range you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m08s)



[do the setup for your unit test act](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m13s)



[ideally a single line of code you do the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m14s)



[one thing that you're testing and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m17s)



[assert you do whatever verification is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m19s)



[necessary to make sure that it works](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m22s)



[so in our arrange we are testing bundled](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m23s)



[theme so let's create one bundled theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m26s)



[spelling counts at least in programming](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m33s)



[spelling has to be consistent even if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m37s)



[it's not 100% accurate let's see I am](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m39s)



[just batting a thousand today on my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m46s)



[typing okay and then in our case we need](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m48s)



[to go through and set up I need to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m52s)



[update at the editor config that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m55s)



[obnoxious](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h05m58s)



[yuck okay so basting property is going](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m00s)



[to get set to base theme the primary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m05s)



[color gets primary color and the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m10s)



[secondary color gets secondary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m14s)



[great huzzah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m17s)



[so we do the work we don't actually have](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m20s)



[what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m27s)



[we were to assignment statements even](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m30s)



[though these things can be inlined like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m33s)



[that with the property initializer I'm](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m35s)



[gonna separate them like this because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m37s)



[the setting these properties is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m39s)



[effectively the thing under test because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m41s)



[the method that we're most interested in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m43s)



[testing is this set theme method and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m45s)



[it's invoked by the property setters so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m47s)



[the the property setters are effectively](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m50s)



[our test great that works let's see so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h06m52s)



[bundled theme is now a resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m01s)



[dictionary I should be able to call yet](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m03s)



[theme I think and I believe get theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m07s)



[should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m13s)



[let's see what is this gonna do if it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m20s)



[doesn't find the information try get](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m22s)



[color secondary mid get color this is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m24s)



[gonna throw an invalid](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m32s)



[I really hate testing that that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m35s)



[condition is what's there but I suppose](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m40s)



[we could actually just go after this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m47s)



[because we know one set theme is called](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m48s)



[it should populate this guy in here so I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m51s)



[think we could just pull this out except](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m53s)



[for the fact that it's private that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m56s)



[makes it a bit obnoxious to try and look](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h07m58s)



[up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m00s)



[how do we want to do this don't really](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m03s)



[want to expose the property it is an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m08s)



[implementation detail so I think what we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m11s)



[should do is call get theme this is this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m14s)



[is actually a good question for anybody](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m16s)



[watching I would love to hear comment on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m19s)



[whether people think calling get theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m21s)



[should return null or throw an exception](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m23s)



[if no theme has been set currently it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m25s)



[throwing the question is is that the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m29s)



[expected behavior or should null be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m33s)



[coming back that is the question well so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m36s)



[we are going to do assert throws and we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m43s)



[expect an invalid operation exception](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m48s)



[yeah import for me please thank you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h08m55s)



[exotic funk one other thing too I was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m03s)



[gonna mention is I don't know what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m05s)



[they're having you do oh don't worry](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m07s)



[about it I don't know what they're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m11s)



[having you used for your class but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m12s)



[definitely look for a they column an IDE](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m17s)



[or an integrated development environment](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m21s)



[so basically the the program that you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m23s)



[use to write the code in you can write](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m25s)



[code in any text editor so you can open](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m28s)



[up notepad or Emacs or VI or or whatever](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m30s)



[your favorite editor is and type code](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m34s)



[and compile it and that works but IDs](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m36s)



[like you'll notice I get like these red](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m40s)



[squigglies and useful error messages oh](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m43s)



[sea lion perfect that that was actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m46s)

[the fact that resharper keeps making me](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m55s)



[feel slow but the the analysis and the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h09m58s)



[useful errors that it gives are very](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m01s)



[worthwhile so so yeah if you're already](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m05s)



[on sea lion great because that will that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m11s)



[will definitely help you be aware that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m13s)



[the IDE will try and force you to write](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m15s)



[code in a particular way](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m16s)



[there are several right ways to write](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m19s)



[code there's a lot of wrong ways and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m22s)



[just be aware that your ID is gonna pick](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m24s)



[one of the right ways and force you down](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m26s)



[it so it's a good it's always good to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m28s)



[learn me where there are technically](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m30s)



[other ways that are still correct but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m32s)



[there's also a lot of incorrect ways so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m35s)



[don't get too distracted on it okay](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m37s)



[where was i bundled theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m41s)



[let's see get theme now I'm gonna just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m45s)



[assert is certain all so this is this is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m52s)



[sort of gonna be a compound thing all at](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h10m58s)



[once right so we're gonna just we're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m01s)



[gonna bundle all kinds of stuff into](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m07s)



[here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m08s)



[it's already forcing me to write code a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m16s)



[certain way well that is probably good](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m18s)



[what is uh](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m20s)



[Mamere I'm not familiar with that is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m21s)



[that uh let's see well ask my good](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m25s)



[friend being to google it for me maybe](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m31s)



[your classroom well scale without](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m35s)



[comprising well that's interesting](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m39s)



[that's kind of cool that is one thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m47s)



[that I I know that well no preview no](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m49s)



[nothing I just wanna I just want to see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m54s)



[a demo take me back to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h11m56s)



[did you do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m04s)



[let's take a look in your classroom](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m13s)



[thank you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m19s)



[scaling automate and tools for insertion](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m23s)



[and scare without comparison quality](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m26s)



[view demo that's what I want to see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m29s)



[that's what I want to see test case](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m31s)



[setup IDE Oh clever magic submission](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m35s)



[online ID yeah cuz something like this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m41s)



[is actually what me and my co-workers](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m45s)



[we've contemplated wanting something](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m51s)



[like this for teaching because by far](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m53s)



[the biggest time consumption isn't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m56s)



[actually teaching the class itself it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h12m59s)



[actually going through and grading all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m02s)



[of the homework because we try to go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m03s)



[through and give all of our students](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m05s)



[code reviews on their homework](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m09s)



[assignments the same way we would if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m10s)



[they were interns working for us which](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m12s)



[is great for them but it's also](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m16s)



[time-consuming for us so it's a pretty](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m19s)



[big time sink and we've we've tried to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m22s)



[figure out ways we can automate it the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m24s)



[hard part is it's you can't automate a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m26s)



[good code review so yeah but that is and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m29s)



[it's kind of a cool setup though ok so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m35s)



[let's see here so this is just light and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m39s)



[this will be primary color I'll just use](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m44s)



[blue that's my example case](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m50s)



[let's see here so boom I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h13m54s)



[actually invert this and put the null](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m02s)



[case all the way at the top](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m04s)



[so this says when all of them are no I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m06s)



[shouldn't get anything when the two base](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m10s)



[colors are no it doesn't matter what the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m13s)



[base theme is I should get nothing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m14s)



[this one certs that when the primary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m17s)



[color is set either by itself should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m21s)



[move this to the top and then I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m23s)



[the only thing we have left are the only](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m30s)



[other condition I care to test here is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m32s)



[secondary color so you go back to null](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m35s)



[we'll do the secondary color I got blue](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m40s)



[again because why not](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m44s)



[blue is great and see no there no there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m47s)



[so each of these should these in line](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h14m55s)



[data's is gonna invoke this method](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m00s)



[passing in the appropriate parameters so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m02s)



[even though I've written sort of one](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m05s)



[unit test I've gotten one two is that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m07s)



[three six nine invocations out of it so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m11s)



[now run it see what happens](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m15s)



[hopefully we get nine Tests and they](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m24s)



[should all fail so this last line here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m28s)



[is a bit complex so assert throw takes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m30s)



[in a delegate we're inside of the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m34s)



[delegate you do an invocation that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m36s)



[expected to throw this exception so if](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m38s)



[this delegate does not throw this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m41s)



[exception your test fails but inside of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m43s)



[this guy I'm actually also in addition](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m48s)



[to doing the invocation that's expected](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m51s)



[to throw the exception I'm also doing in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m53s)



[a certain Knoll just to make sure that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m55s)



[if this guy comes back this will throw a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h15m58s)



[very different exception and propagate](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m01s)



[up not sure if that's 100% necessary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m04s)



[Nowell worry about that worry about that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m11s)



[in a minute](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m14s)



[let's make sure these tests actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m15s)



[pass first so I bring my test window](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m16s)



[back over here go ahead and just dock on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m20s)



[the bottom for me thanks](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m23s)



[let's see dialog hosts test this is the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m27s)



[one I want go through finish compiling I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m30s)



[am noticing that it's missing some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m36s)



[dependency so it probably has to pull](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m39s)



[down everything first okay nine tests](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m40s)



[all of them are green great I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m45s)



[this isn't actually that helpful because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m49s)



[if it doesn't like if it returns a value](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m52s)



[it by definition then has not thrown an](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m55s)



[exception so yeah okay let's see so when](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h16m58s)



[all values](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m09s)



[our set theme is set so in this case we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m15s)



[aren't going to do different values I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m22s)



[don't know if those should we take](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m26s)



[values in for these sure let's actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m31s)



[let's actually set these values we can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m35s)



[just validate that we actually get well](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m38s)



[we're gonna set all of them it doesn't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m40s)



[really make sense we'll just do one so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m44s)



[this would be a simple unit test so base](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m49s)



[theme we will do base theme light](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h17m51s)



[currently in the 300 release it is the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m00s)



[for the top level themes you have to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m04s)



[pick light or dark](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m06s)



[I do have an outstanding feature request](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m08s)



[where if you select inherit and you're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m11s)



[on Windows 10 I want it to fall back to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m13s)



[the the windows theme that way it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m15s)



[follows with your light or dark let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m17s)



[see here so primary color blue are here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m20s)



[let's do let's do the purple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m27s)



[we'll make it match and make it match](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m31s)



[the theme and I believe it's purple and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m33s)



[lime is the normal one so and then this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m36s)



[guy here should not throw any more I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m39s)



[should get back a themed object so I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m41s)



[beam theme right so that she pulled me](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m45s)



[back a theme and do I want to assert on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m49s)



[anything here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h18m52s)



[I'm not sure I probably should just to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m03s)



[make sure that it actually got set with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m07s)



[the appropriate one so a sir equal and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m08s)



[what is the I don't remember my lookup](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m13s)



[there's a lookup call that has to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m16s)



[done to go swatch helper lookup](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m18s)



[that's what it is](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m21s)



[so swatch helper look up let's see here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m26s)



[primary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m32s)



[purple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m37s)



[classwork due tomorrow but don't think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m41s)



[I'm going to be able to finish it just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m43s)



[wrestling with concepts or not enough](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m46s)



[hours in a day](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m49s)



[well worst case scenario I would say it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m53s)



[is probably if you have to pick picked a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h19m56s)



[study and try to understand the concepts](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m01s)



[even if that means not necessarily](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m03s)



[always getting in the assignments it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m05s)



[will serve you better making sure that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m08s)



[you understand the material rather than](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m10s)



[just kind of quickly turning something](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m12s)



[in that gets you by in the short term](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m14s)



[but doesn't help you long term and I am](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m17s)



[not offended if you need to leave and go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m23s)



[and and actually get your coursework](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m25s)



[done so let's see primary color purple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m27s)



[it is uh what did you just do to me](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m35s)



[twitch why did you why did you empty my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m42s)



[chat window](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m45s)



[unfortunately my my moderator extension](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m50s)



[apparently wiped my chat screen from me](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h20m53s)



[so I missed the chat one second oh yeah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m00s)



[no I get it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m11s)



[I I haven't actually done a lot of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m13s)



[configuration on my moderator thing I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m15s)



[basically just turned on the yeah here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m17s)



[let's actually do some moderation and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m19s)



[didn't actually configure it too much so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m21s)



[yeah it's all good I was looking for](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m30s)



[primary colors so I actually care what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m34s)



[this purple is don't I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m37s)



[purple swatch because I don't actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m40s)



[know well I guess I don't actually care](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m42s)



[so this is my because this should this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m45s)



[swatch helper should be my much the same](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m49s)



[same one here and then this should be my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m52s)



[themed primary mid color so those should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h21m56s)



[match](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m01s)



[and I would say that is the the right](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m06s)



[attitude make sure you understand what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m08s)



[you're learning](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m10s)



[very](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m19s)



[let's do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m21s)



[secondary color lime I believe that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m23s)



[the same look up it's just uh yep yep](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m27s)



[yep so this should be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m32s)



[secondary mid boom and then we'll just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m37s)



[do an assertion on the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m44s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m50s)



[let's see there's a base themed object](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m53s)



[somewhere somewhere somewhere somewhere](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m56s)



[somewhere somewhere let's see here this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h22m58s)



[it's buried in this theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m03s)



[cool yeah hey I do appreciate it always](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m08s)

[do any of it and I've never had to do it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m29s)



[commercially so I've done some C though](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m31s)



[so there's a little bit overlap theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m34s)



[light dark that's what I'm after that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m39s)



[what I'm after so back over here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m41s)

[on a teacher I think most people who do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h23m59s)



[a lot of development are actually pretty](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m09s)



[good about trying to help people we all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m12s)



[started learning at some point in our](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m15s)

[more fresh in our minds than others so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m19s)



[let's see a material design body is the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m24s)



[expected theme body so if those all pass](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m26s)



[we're gonna call it good enough because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m32s)



[the the important part here is not that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m34s)



[all of the properties of the theme gets](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m35s)



[set that's not actually what's being](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m38s)



[tested what's actually what we want to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m40s)



[verify is that it has appropriately](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m42s)



[created a theme from the values that we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m45s)



[passed see you exotic fuck good luck on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m47s)



[your homework try and get some sleep](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m50s)



[sleep is actually important](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m52s)



[okay let's see here I think this would](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h24m58s)



[get us as close to getting these guys](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m01s)



[tested and in I have been going through](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m05s)



[trying to make sure that I add unit](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m08s)



[tests as new code comes in especially](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m14s)



[for stuff that is unit testable which](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m16s)



[there's a large bit of this library](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m19s)



[that's just not unit testable due to its](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m20s)



[nature assert equals failure well then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m24s)



[what failed where's my it's my window](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m28s)



[showing me the actual output there is a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m33s)

[output there that's what I want](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m43s)



[expected actual let's see light](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m47s)



[materials I'm body theme background](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m53s)



[expected to get the light brush got](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h25m58s)



[something very much not the light brush](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m02s)



[interesting so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m07s)



[what happened let's see here so base](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m11s)



[theme was set to light primarycolour](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m21s)



[secondarycolour well I must be missing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m25s)



[something because I am not seeing it get](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m32s)



[base theme dark returns dark light](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m39s)



[returns light okay that gets that theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m43s)



[set theme oh let's see here set solid](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m50s)



[color brush la blah blah body themed](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h26m56s)



[body](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m01s)



[let's see here where is where did the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m07s)



[theme create let's see set the base](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m11s)



[theme this guy should have come in with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m17s)



[here should have grabbed material design](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m20s)



[Oh](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m27s)



[chair design body](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m28s)



[to do that is what we used okay](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m38s)



[grasping at straws here and something's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m45s)



[coming up something's coming up wrong](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m47s)



[and so let's start with this let's dive](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m49s)



[into this guy and just see let's see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m52s)



[Sameera material design body expected a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h27m57s)



[lot of DS so it's not something that's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m01s)



[just backwards right](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m06s)



[it's interesting that it's saying](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m16s)



[all f's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m20s)



[that is not a color code that is really](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m28s)



[used inside of the theme much which](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m33s)



[makes me which makes me very suspect](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m35s)



[that this is an issue of something not](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m38s)



[being said yeah because it's not used](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m41s)



[anywhere inside of the dark theme I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m45s)



[suspect when I look at light I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m47s)



[see the same thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m49s)



[Oh](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m55s)



[card background design background](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h28m58s)



[I didn't just botch the test did I let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m10s)



[see oh well I did do that I compared](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m13s)



[them if you're gonna use body you should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m21s)



[use body in both places not background](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m24s)



[in one and body in the other that'll](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m26s)



[probably do it I was gonna be a little](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m28s)



[shocked because I've got apps using this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m33s)



[new stuff and what I like to think I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m36s)



[would have caught that bug](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m38s)



[flip you back over](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m47s)



[okay so let's get this test going and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m51s)



[then I think we'll basically take these](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m53s)



[same tests and reapply them to the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m56s)



[custom color because it's basically the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h29m59s)



[same same problem and green test success](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m03s)



[okay so the interest of completely](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m13s)



[cheating copy everything we just did](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m20s)



[move it down let's see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m25s)



[custom color theme tests and then no](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m32s)



[don't apply rename refactoring move to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m40s)



[your own file please](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m45s)



[just movie that out save all and I got](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m47s)



[too much stuff open so close all but](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m53s)



[this let's see here so you change to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h30m55s)



[custom color theme you change to custom](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m01s)



[color theme you are now colors so we can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m07s)



[do colors fuchsia because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m13s)



[nothing says awesome like a little bit](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m22s)



[of fuchsia colors lime and that makes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m24s)



[this a lot easier because rather than](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m30s)



[doing the lookup you should be able to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m33s)



[assert that this is colors fuchsia and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m35s)



[this should be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m39s)



[colors lime and the light thing should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m46s)



[still work so we'll do the same thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m49s)



[here this is going to become a color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m54s)



[this is going to become a color and so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h31m59s)



[then you just need to become will use](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m04s)



[blue again rather than primary color](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m07s)



[that goes there goes there and colors](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m13s)



[goes there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m19s)



[that boom](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m23s)



[I think that works right so what are you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m27s)



[whining about oh these are not so the in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m30s)



[c-sharp attributes the values past](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m41s)



[attributes have to be compiled time](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m44s)



[constants when your c-sharp gets](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m45s)



[compiled into il the the values that are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m49s)



[in those are literally just written](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m52s)



[straight into the il which is why they](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m55s)



[must be constant the problem is is even](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h32m58s)



[though these colors are basically](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m00s)



[constant because it's color from nth](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m03s)



[value and you know here's the the codes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m05s)



[for all of these these are still](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m08s)



[effectively just static properties when](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m13s)



[you when you call this it still has to](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m15s)



[invoke this method and do this work it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m17s)



[not necessarily known at compile time so](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m21s)



[this is not going to work okay well I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m24s)



[guess that means we have to switch and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m31s)



[not use inline data for this test so we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m33s)



[should be able to use believe it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m36s)



[member data name](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m38s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m43s)



[and I I don't require quite remember the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m49s)



[syntax for this I can I always I always](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m53s)



[mess it up so let's just look it up X](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m55s)



[unit member data basically you can give](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h33m58s)



[it either a property or a function that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m02s)



[returns an object array sure this blog](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m05s)



[post looks like I've been there before](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m09s)



[and from that from that array of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m11s)



[effectively an array of an array that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m17s)



[you pass it that's where it gets the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m19s)



[value rather than looking at the come on](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m24s)



[let's go rather than looking at the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m27s)



[attributes okay I'm gonna put you on my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m30s)



[second monitor you think about what](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m33s)



[you've done for the moment and I'm going](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m34s)



[to just build this out so public I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m37s)



[I can do an eye numerable of object](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m42s)



[array so foo for now](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m47s)



[fix you up in a minute and I think you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m54s)



[have to be static I think it has to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h34m58s)



[static let's see here so we basically](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m01s)



[just need to convert all of you into](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m06s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m13s)



[so name of will very much be helpful](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m19s)



[here there you go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m22s)



[let's see slowing typing Florence yeah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m26s)



[believe me I'm I'm well aware that it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m30s)



[the cause of the performance problems I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m32s)



[know at some point I'm gonna get fed up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m34s)



[into and uninstall it but that is not a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m37s)



[today thing actually let's do let's do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m41s)



[this occasionally let's see here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m44s)



[code](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m53s)



[let's just fire BS code sometimes I find](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h35m57s)



[the the multi cursor support and BS code](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m00s)



[to be absolutely amazing so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m02s)



[cuz I figure out what window its opening](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m06s)



[on let me just just gonna move it to the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m08s)



[moment because I don't know what I had](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m13s)



[open last and I don't want necessarily](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m14s)



[get bit by something here oh yeah we're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m16s)



[fine we're fine this is just one of my](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m21s)



[other projects okay so so paste there](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m24s)



[highlight here on indent let's see here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m31s)



[and keyboard shortcut here is ctrl shift](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m37s)



[alt so yield return see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m43s)



[now what is the believe it's alt](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h36m57s)



[Shh well here we can do this and I can](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m05s)



[go control-d all the way down](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m08s)



[let's see some new array like that like](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m10s)



[that and I think I actually need to do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m19s)



[because if I don't type the array it's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m25s)



[not gonna be able to infer the type just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m28s)



[from the values so let's do this let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m31s)



[do this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m39s)



[let's do this oh look that other another](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m41s)



[site is failing to load great we can do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m49s)



[this from memory](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m53s)



[no different one loads great great great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h37m57s)



[great great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h38m01s)



[that will work okay so Oh got a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h38m02s)



[semicolon on the end of them](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h38m07s)



[okay so neighbor regex let's see match](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h38m09s)

[with regex](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h38m54s)

[to apply rename refactoring](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h39m47s)



[should change that up and that should](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h39m53s)



[all work and now we can pass through our](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m00s)



[color values and though they aren't even](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m03s)



[though they aren't compiled time](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m08s)



[constants so on the unit tests and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m10s)



[I think the only thing left on this pull](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m15s)



[request so this changed the base library](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m17s)



[but those markup extensions are actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m21s)



[used by the MA Apps integration library](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m24s)



[as well and so we're just going to go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m27s)



[and change those as well to basically do](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m29s)



[the same thing that way it tracks right](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m32s)



[along with with the base library because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m35s)



[I do want to try and keep the API is the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m41s)



[same I think I should go through I've](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m43s)



[got to remember that this is going to be](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m48s)



[a breaking change I've got a running](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m50s)



[list that's AA unit test passes great of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m52s)



[all of the breaking changes coming in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m57s)



[three Oh again I don't expect this one](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h40m59s)



[will break too many people unless you](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m02s)



[are like deriving from the built-in](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m05s)



[markup extensions to do your own thing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m07s)



[which is perfectly doable and this will](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m09s)



[be a breaking change that is coming so I](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m12s)



[am also noticing that this project](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m16s)



[doesn't have a unit test project](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m19s)



[probably a problem okay](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m22s)



[so the ma apps bundle thing derives from](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m27s)



[bundled theme and this is why there was](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m30s)



[the protected set theme so let's go](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m33s)



[through and do let's see here I think](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m38s)



[this is probably why are you squawking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m43s)



[base theme light](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m52s)



[Oh because it's resolving haha clever](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h41m57s)



[so I accidentally caused the breaking](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m02s)



[change with the renamed got it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m03s)



[material design themes I think this will](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m11s)



[get fixed if we clean this up so let's](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m15s)



[change this guy here because I don't](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m18s)



[think we need to pass in the resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m27s)



[dictionary itself anymore that's just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m28s)



[going to become this call because we are](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m31s)



[this object itself is a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m39s)



[is a resource dictionary sorry](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m50s)



[it is getting late see is based theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m53s)



[the enum please base theme so we're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h42m57s)



[gonna do the same sort of pattern](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m01s)



[matching that we did before grab this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m02s)

[so seam manager I'm wondering if yeah](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m14s)



[that's fine okay so this goes then to a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m23s)



[lowercase B that now works](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m27s)



[everyone's happy there to do WPF dot](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m33s)



[disambiguate that guy and then this guy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m48s)



[needs to be set theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h43m53s)



[see](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m05s)



[detected Virtual Set theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m09s)



[I theme theme all right so this guy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m16s)



[comes through here](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m21s)



[this guy is just going to call set theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m29s)



[directly](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m33s)



[and if you don't set a return type it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m45s)



[gets very very confused okay so private](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m48s)



[method builds the theme called set theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m54s)



[oh this will be a problem if we do this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h44m56s)



[because this has the same signature as](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m09s)



[the extension method you'll notice as](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m13s)



[soon as I rename this now magically the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m19s)



[extension method comes in and takes over](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m22s)



[which is what we want so let's change](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m25s)



[this up a little ply theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m32s)



[we'll call this fly theme - and drop the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m39s)



[- and everything should line up straight](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m47s)



[now okay so that goes there and now we](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m49s)



[just need to fix the my up side of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m55s)



[things so protected override this guy](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h45m59s)



[will become fly theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m02s)



[hi theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m10s)



[this guy really should always have a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m13s)



[value but I just don't want to make that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m15s)



[assumption oh sure we'll take some](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m16s)



[performance gains why not](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m21s)



[okay so this guy here is now working and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m27s)



[the MA apps custom color theme same](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m31s)



[changes here so apply theme drop the](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m36s)



[resource dictionary replace it with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m42s)



[calls to this](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m44s)



[and this becomes base ply theme](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h46m53s)



[oh I need to make the same change over](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m01s)



[here let's see just in the interest of](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m03s)



[keeping things consistent](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m09s)



[probably a common base class between](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m16s)



[these two](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m19s)



[maybe seems really wasteful to have a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m24s)



[common base class simply for the one](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m27s)



[method](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m31s)



[if anyone feels strongly post a comment](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m37s)



[or an issue I I'm not opposed to it it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m39s)



[just feels like building the object](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m42s)



[hierarchy the principle called the Agni](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m45s)



[you ain't gonna need it I kind of feel](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m49s)



[like that right now okay so if base](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m52s)



[theme is base theme base theme build](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h47m56s)



[this guy out boom so this becomes a](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m03s)



[lowercase B and we have the same issue](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m08s)



[here with the ambiguous reference clean](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m11s)



[that up clean that up](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m15s)



[and then same static change there and it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m17s)



[should just work great if anyone wants](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m26s)



[to go through and start up a unit test](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m31s)



[project for this and basically mirror](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m33s)



[the same thing that was done here that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m34s)



[would be great](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m36s)



[I think for now I'm going to just push](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m41s)



[this okay](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m46s)



[so let's review changes boom boom](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m48s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m51s)



[okay so mobs changes are the ones that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m53s)



[we just did so they should match that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h48m56s)



[theme goes to apply theme checks with](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m01s)

[works](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m15s)



[I suppose we should probably actually](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m15s)



[fire up the demo app real quick and just](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m17s)



[make sure everything everything is still](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m18s)



[kosher I want to double check because](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m21s)



[this is now primary color secondary](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m28s)



[color so just to make sure that this all](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m35s)



[works we're gonna comment this out and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m45s)



[this should fire up and work just fine](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h49m50s)

[basically the exact same thing multiple](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m10s)



[properties all the way down sea resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m13s)



[dictionary extensions](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m17s)



[generated files](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m23s)



[Visual Studio you are making reviewing](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m27s)



[the diff very hard I understand you're](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m29s)



[compiling stop messing with my viewer](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m32s)

[was removed which makes sense and then](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m49s)



[we added some unit tests great that](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m51s)



[looks like it so let's add a few](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m55s)



[comments here so removed markup](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h50m59s)



[extension in favor of resource](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h51m04s)

[resharper hides it from me because it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h51m44s)



[resharper hijacks the intellisense and](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h51m48s)



[Visual Studio if you let it and so it](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h51m50s)



[puts its own in its place and resharper](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h51m54s)



[is actually hip to the idea of the mark](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h51m56s)



[of extension attributes](https://youtu.be/yDFNm5HCstE?t=01h52m00s)
