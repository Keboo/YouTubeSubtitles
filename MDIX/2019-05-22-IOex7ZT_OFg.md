[people were saying that they couldn't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h00m48s)



[find reference to it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h00m51s)



[I went poking around and realized that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h00m52s)



[when I was testing my Azure DevOps build](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h00m55s)



[I had disabled the nougat deployment so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h01m02s)



[I just turned that on a few moments ago](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h01m06s)

[stuff I find that it helps keep things](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h02m28s)



[readable we'll still keeping things](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h02m31s)



[small without cluttering stuff up so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h02m33s)



[there's a worthwhile thing to come a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h02m35s)



[little more familiar with markdown so is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h02m38s)

[there so I wanted to start with getting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h02m58s)



[a so this pull request right here from](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m02s)



[tide there the the demo app that we have](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m07s)



[here has been slowly getting a little](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m11s)



[more jam-packed full of everything so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m14s)



[we've gotten all of this button page and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m18s)



[this is probably one of the biggest](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m21s)



[offenders that's just huge there's lots](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m23s)



[of stuff tied into this and going along](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m26s)



[with that just there's all this extra](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m33s)



[content to the right that you don't know](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m36s)



[about](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m38s)



[there's no horizontal scroll and I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m38s)



[really kind of prefer to avoid the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m41s)



[horizontal scroll for this header it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m42s)



[not that big of a deal to me](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m44s)



[but for this content having stuff cut](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m45s)



[off like this without any indication](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m48s)



[that hey look there is actually more](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m49s)



[stuff and then this kind of obnoxious](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m51s)



[guy ends up covering this stuff up down](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m54s)



[here and it just gets a little messy so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m56s)



[I had put in an issue specifically](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h03m59s)



[asking people who are willing to get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m05s)



[this cleaned up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m09s)



[and specifically this 12:50 is the issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m11s)



[here so clean up the buttons page in the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m15s)



[demo app and it looks like tide has](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m19s)



[probably cleaned up all of these issues](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m23s)



[so we're gonna take a quick peek because](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m25s)



[this pull request shows clean that it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m28s)



[in a clean merged state so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m30s)



[just jump over here real quick it might](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m33s)



[actually be might actually be easiest to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m38s)



[just jump over and look at the new stuff](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m42s)



[so it looks like several new pages we've](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m45s)



[got a ratings bar page a toggles page](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m49s)



[that's the CS for this guy here great so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h04m55s)



[it looks like just a couple new pages](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m01s)



[built in with some stuff moved around](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m03s)



[and it's probably easiest if we just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m05s)



[pull open the pull request and look at](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m09s)



[it so I always love love my get cracking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m11s)



[for this because it makes my life a lot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m15s)



[easy or a lot easier verifying pull](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m17s)



[requests because you can just double](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m22s)



[click and it goes and does the the hard](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m23s)



[effort of creating a get remote checking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m27s)



[out the branch pulling it down so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m33s)



[you can go through and look and it looks](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m36s)



[like this is probably why it's a clean](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m38s)



[merge tides gone through and kept it up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m40s)



[to date with the latest changes so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m44s)



[makes it nice and easy for me which if](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m46s)

[really does help make my life easier and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m51s)



[get stuff merged in quicker so we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m54s)



[gonna take a look at this and then I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h05m59s)



[think we'll probably clean up some more](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m01s)



[of the to 600 requests and see if we can](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m02s)



[get that release a little closer to out](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m05s)



[the door and if we can get a bit of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m06s)



[those guys chunked out I may end up even](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m12s)



[doing a couple other open source](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m17s)



[projects that I commit to on this stream](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m19s)



[as well so there's another one called](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m21s)



[system command-line and I will pull that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m24s)



[guy up if people are interested let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m27s)



[see here it's this repository underneath](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m30s)



[the dotnet organisation command line API](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m37s)



[basically a simple library with sort of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m40s)



[three big purposes all around command](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m43s)



[line apps so there's the basic library](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m47s)



[which is designed to make parsing that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m51s)



[string array that comes into your main](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m54s)



[method in a sane manner](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m56s)



[and gives you a lot of helpers and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h06m59s)



[various things there's a rendering](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m01s)



[library which needs lots of love that's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m03s)



[probably where I'll spend some time](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m05s)



[playing that's designed to make](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m07s)



[rendering output to the console a lot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m10s)



[easier especially with virtual terminal](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m13s)



[mode and that sort of thing and then](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m16s)



[there's dragonfruit which is actually](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m18s)



[the most exciting of all of them in that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m19s)



[it lets you write strongly-typed main](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m22s)



[methods so I'll just jump over here to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m24s)



[the wiki real quick because I believe it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m27s)



[shows a pretty good example in here of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m31s)



[what you can do because normally this is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m33s)



[what your main method looks like when](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m35s)



[you build a new console app but with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m37s)



[dragonfruit you can now write your main](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m40s)



[method like this and it'll generate help](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m44s)



[pulling in the xml docs for you and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m47s)



[invoke your method and pass the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m50s)



[appropriate values through so that you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m52s)



[can focus on what does my console app](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m53s)



[need to do and not how do i how do I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m56s)



[deal with this string array so might](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h07m59s)



[have a little fun and poke around in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m03s)



[this library since I've done quite a bit](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m06s)



[of work in that so back to where we were](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m08s)



[going](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m10s)



[demo app we want to look at this pull](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m11s)



[request to see what's going on with the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m16s)



[buttons](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m18s)



[I think I've got enough caffeine I do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m23s)



[also have a slightly different mic](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m30s)



[situation tonight which i think is going](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m31s)



[to be a little bit cleaner when it comes](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m33s)



[to actually recording just turn that off](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m37s)



[don't need you okay so let's take a look](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m45s)



[here so new buttons page is probably the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m48s)



[first place to look](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m52s)



[we've got buttons this is a lot cleaner](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m54s)



[nothing floating to the side buttons](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h08m59s)



[with corner radius and if we should](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m02s)



[break these out](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m06s)



[maybe maybe not those are probably fine](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m14s)



[buttons with progress than the pop-up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m16s)



[box ones so the only thing I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m19s)



[is these pop-up box guys getting a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m20s)



[little cut off at the bottom they](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m23s)



[probably just need a little extra margin](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m25s)



[and that guy there I might default this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m26s)



[guy to checked let's just fix that here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m34s)



[real quick while we're in here we've got](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m38s)



[live zamel editing turned on so let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m41s)



[live at it the sam'l I think we just get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m43s)



[both of those little just minor UI](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m49s)



[things cleaned up so let's see the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h09m52s)



[pencil you want to go over here so this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m01s)



[is the check box and I think what we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m05s)



[gonna do is we're gonna default this guy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m07s)



[to is checked that way when you first](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m08s)



[come in here you can actually click this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m18s)



[rather than needing to do the double](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m19s)



[click and then let's deal with the other](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m21s)



[guys getting cut off a little bit so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m24s)



[what's going on there you think it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m25s)



[probably just an alignment issue so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m29s)



[zamel display wonder I think this thing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m36s)



[is derived from yeah let's just put a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m43s)



[little bottom padding on it so let's see](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m49s)



[left top right 5 on the bottom](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m53s)



[oh this probably actually needs to be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h10m56s)



[margin you're not padding I think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m02s)



[padding is probably being dropped by the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m05s)



[the template that's being put on this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m08s)



[control just put 5 on the bottom and see](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m11s)



[how that comes out interesting that did](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m14s)



[not do what I expected](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m20s)



[find out play this around a little bit](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m26s)



[ah no there's the scrollbar maybe it did](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m29s)



[work the first time let's take this off](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m34s)



[thought it was getting cropped but it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m36s)



[could have just been yeah it was just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m38s)



[the scrollbar putting that extra margin](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m41s)



[on there fixes the scroll issue so we'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m43s)



[just add 0 5 on the margin to both of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m47s)



[those to make them line up straight and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m52s)



[now they aren't covering anything up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m54s)



[they're both overeager wonder what is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h11m58s)



[the what is the real difference between](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m03s)



[these two so is this just showing off](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m06s)



[custom obesity this is showing off](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m09s)



[they're very very similar buttons I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m14s)



[guess this one's got the command](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m18s)



[handlers](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m21s)



[this one's disabling a button and this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m22s)



[one's changing the opacity of it yeah](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m23s)



[we'll leave it okay let's just why these](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m28s)



[guys up a little nicer I think that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m32s)



[looks a lot better](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m35s)



[great are you whining about here column](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m36s)



[not set not real concern not real](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m42s)



[concern resharper ok so let's go back](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m47s)



[and let's check out some of the other](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m50s)



[ones so now we should have toggles page](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m51s)



[with all of these guys in here like](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h12m56s)



[those yeah this looks much nicer so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m01s)



[toggle button toggles to go back and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m06s)



[look here should probably move the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m09s)



[checkbox over to the toggle side because](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m13s)



[none of these guys are the checkbox](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m18s)



[controls I with the exception of this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m19s)



[guy right here but it probably actually](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m21s)



[belongs on this side with the actual](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m25s)



[check marks yeah so we should move the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m29s)



[check marks that's going to be a c-sharp](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m34s)



[change so we will do that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m36s)



[after we get after we get this the app](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m37s)



[stopped so the rating bars are working](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m43s)



[read only reading bar so I can't click](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m48s)



[on ok yeah I think that looks really](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m51s)



[nice I think just moving that one last](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h13m57s)



[header over and that it's not the page I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m00s)



[want to load so let's go move that its](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m03s)



[main page P model or those guys live](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m07s)



[right in the main window it's in the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m13s)



[view model so I think that's domains](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m17s)



[main window view model so all of those](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m19s)



[this is kind of a constant question I've](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m23s)



[seen a lot people ask kind of the basic](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m25s)



[question of how do I do a navigation](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m28s)



[similar to where the the demo app does](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m30s)



[it so there's a couple pieces that all](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m33s)



[go into it and let's walk through those](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m35s)



[real quick and I'll show you where all](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m38s)



[of those are located so it starts with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m41s)



[the main window so in the main window](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m43s)



[the key layout pieces are first this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m46s)



[drawer host this is what's giving that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m50s)



[fly out from the left with all the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m53s)



[navigation options and so on the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m55s)



[left-hand side there's this list box I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h14m59s)



[can set this guy to the side for a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m02s)



[moment that contains all of the items](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m05s)



[this is just a normal list box which is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m07s)



[this guy right here the key part for the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m10s)



[navigation is this onto element down I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m14s)



[know it's not this is just unchecking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m18s)



[the this is just walking back up where](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m25s)



[is the selection I'll have a pop up of a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m29s)



[demo list box there it is so this scroll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m35s)



[viewer and content control this is this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m45s)



[main view area here these guys are](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m47s)



[the content is bound to the selected](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m51s)



[item in that list box so when the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m54s)



[selected item change it goes and pulls](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h15m58s)



[in various properties off of that item](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m00s)



[so we'll look at the item in a minute](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m03s)



[but it's got things about the horizontal](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m05s)



[scrollbar visibility margins the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m08s)



[important one is the content itself to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m11s)



[be able to set all of those up and then](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m15s)



[the documentation links for the top](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m16s)



[that's sort of how that layout is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m17s)



[getting done the other bit that goes](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m19s)



[along with this is there's two toggle](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m23s)



[buttons kind of that play here so this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m25s)



[toggle button right here is this back](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m27s)



[arrow that you see and you can kind of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m32s)



[watch it animate and see how it's how](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m33s)



[it's always there but there's this other](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m36s)



[toggle button on the main color zone](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m38s)



[this hamburger menu one so this guy is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m41s)



[this toggle button right here and he has](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m46s)



[a slightly different style this is just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m49s)



[a really convenient style that sets up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m51s)



[the icons and whatnot there's nothing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m54s)



[really fancy about this toggle button](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m56s)



[aside from the the hammer icon and the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h16m57s)



[the fancy animations that go along with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m01s)



[it so this guy here and let's see is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m03s)



[what these guys end up getting bound to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m09s)



[so these guys are both watching the same](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m14s)



[is checked state to know whether to open](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m16s)



[or close this left drawer which is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m19s)



[what's ultimately opening and closing it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m21s)



[so then the last piece from this list](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m25s)



[box it's bound to this collection of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m29s)



[demo items so on the view model itself](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m31s)



[we have a demo items array and this demo](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m34s)



[item itself has a bunch of things on it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m39s)



[it's got a name which is what gets](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m41s)



[displayed in the list box it's got the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m43s)



[content and then it's got a collection](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m46s)



[of those documentation links that go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m47s)



[along the top so and then here's also](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m49s)



[where it pulls in the scroll bar](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m52s)



[visibility and all of that jazz so in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m54s)



[our case we just want to move one of the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h17m58s)



[documentation links from buttons](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m00s)



[specifically the one about check](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m02s)



[and we should stop execution so we want](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m06s)



[to move that one down to be part of the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m11s)



[toggles down here we'll just fire it up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m15s)



[one more time to make sure that change](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m19s)



[fixes it and we are probably pretty](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m21s)



[close on getting this guy done](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m25s)



[let's check this guy out and we'll see](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m48s)



[what's going on so now if I go to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m50s)



[buttons I no longer see checkbox along](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m53s)



[the top and if I go to toggles](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h18m57s)



[checkboxes there and it opens the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m01s)



[documentation page which actually takes](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m07s)



[you to the theme dictionary for all of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m09s)



[the checkbox controls so if you're ever](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m13s)



[looking at these and going oh where](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m15s)



[where is this style defined usually you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m17s)



[can find a reference to it right up at](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m22s)



[the top that you can click on it should](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m23s)



[take you right to it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m26s)



[so let's go through back to the lovely](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m28s)



[get crackin and let's see here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m32s)



[stage all changes so and add a little](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m34s)



[padding to the buttons view I guess we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m41s)



[should little margin and moved tation](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m48s)



[little dink checkbox on to the toggles](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h19m58s)



[page cool commit these changes and main](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m04s)



[button cleanup great will push this guy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m17s)



[back out and then we will get that one](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m20s)



[merged in excellent let's go back to our](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m23s)



[pull request](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m30s)



[this guy should kick off github notices](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m33s)



[we're different and I'm just gonna get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m38s)



[this guy merged and not necessarily wait](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m45s)



[on getting this so it is too sick so not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m47s)



[that it matters too much since it's not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m52s)



[going out with the library just the demo](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m54s)



[app but I do try to I do try to keep](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m55s)



[these milestones in sync okay so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h20m57s)



[that gets that guy merged in okay so I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m02s)



[think what we might take a crack at is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m09s)



[this rich text box one tonight because](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m11s)



[this is something that the library has](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m13s)



[been lacking for a while in that if you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m15s)



[go through and add a rich text box to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m18s)



[your project there's no built-in style](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m23s)



[for it so I think we should go through](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m26s)



[and look at what it takes to just kind](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m28s)



[of create a brand-new style from scratch](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m35s)



[so we're gonna pull from master and then](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m37s)



[I no longer need well let's let's get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m40s)



[off that branch first I gotta clean up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m42s)



[way too many branches so go ahead and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m45s)



[remove that so I don't need that anymore](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m49s)



[and 64 remote branches so just remove](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h21m52s)



[some of these remotes so I don't have](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m00s)



[quite as many things to flip through I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m02s)



[tend to get a lot of these built up just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m04s)



[looking at pull requests and issues that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m06s)



[come in we'll leave that one in for now](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m09s)



[because I think there's probably some](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m16s)



[more work that's gonna happen on some of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m19s)



[the theming stuff but for now we are](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m21s)



[doing great branch so we'll do rich text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m24s)



[box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m32s)



[yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m36s)



[okay so let's go let's go take a quick](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m40s)



[peek so first thing we need to do is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m43s)



[figure out where this guy needs to live](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m46s)



[so down in here underneath so in the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m50s)



[main core library there is a themes](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m53s)



[folder that contains all of these and I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h22m57s)



[think text box is probably probably](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m01s)



[gonna do something kind of similar but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m06s)



[it's gonna be more akin to the field](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m09s)



[text box trying to decide if we bring](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m11s)



[rich text box into there or we separate](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m16s)



[it I think we probably separated before](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m18s)



[there was a little bit of grouping with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m23s)



[common controls here but I think moving](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m25s)



[forward I'm probably more interested and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m28s)



[separating things out at a minimum it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m31s)



[just makes it easier when people want to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m33s)



[go and find things so let's kill](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m34s)



[execution and we'll add a new resource](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m36s)



[dictionary so material design theme rich](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m40s)



[text box Edie](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m50s)



[okay the next thing we need to do is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m56s)



[figure out what this needs to actually](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h23m59s)



[look like so if we google with being and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m01s)



[jump in here let's take a look at what](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m08s)



[the spec calls for since I know that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m11s)



[there's some quite a few differences](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m13s)



[with the current version of the spec and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m16s)



[what's in the library just due to the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m17s)



[material design - Oh update that they](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m19s)



[did so if people find issues there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m22s)



[please log them I know that there are](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m24s)



[differences throughout this library and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m27s)



[I haven't spent a lot of time going](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m28s)



[through and finding those so if you come](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m30s)



[across one I would I'd appreciate a log](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m33s)



[specifically if you can link back to the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m35s)



[corresponding documentation page and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m38s)



[point out what's different that makes my](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m40s)



[life a lot easier when it comes time to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m42s)



[fix it or if you just want to fix it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m44s)



[yourself](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m46s)



[either one is good by me so fields](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m47s)



[outlined so this is just a simple field](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m52s)



[I was hoping they had an example of a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h24m57s)



[multi-line text box container label](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m00s)



[input text this is just our validation](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m08s)



[stuff icons prefix states outline text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m14s)



[field dense](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m29s)



[single line text fields multi-line text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m36s)



[fields so so this is a key thing here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m40s)



[and that it starts the multi-line ones](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m51s)



[and text areas start as single line](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h25m55s)



[expand out this shouldn't be too bad](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m02s)



[this is really similar to the default](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m05s)



[behavior and so will probably be able to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m07s)



[get a lot of reuse out of the existing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m09s)



[stuff that we have okay so they don't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m12s)



[draw much of a distinction between](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m16s)



[multi-line and single line which is fine](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m19s)



[we have a concept of a rich text box but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m23s)



[I think in the purpose of this library](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m26s)



[rich text box just means that we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m29s)



[gonna be able to do some fancy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m32s)



[formatting inside of this I don't know](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m33s)



[if it makes a lot of sense to to do much](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m36s)



[more beyond that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m40s)



[hey Cory I think I'm running solo today](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m51s)



[I I don't know how much to trust my](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m56s)



[viewercount but it you may very well be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h26m58s)



[the only one watching this live so enjoy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m01s)



[we're making pretty text boxes tonight](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m05s)



[if that helps yeah I think this is what](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m07s)



[we're gonna build out so last thing to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m12s)



[take a look at is WPF default control](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m17s)



[templates so we can go and look at the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m22s)



[default control template for the rich](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m25s)



[text box that's fine i I just enjoy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m28s)



[talking to myself Cory so it's it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m33s)



[doesn't bother me at all because I'm](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m35s)



[probably going to be spending my night](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m39s)



[doing this coding anyway I might as well](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m41s)



[share the experience and at least record](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m43s)



[it so others can enjoy it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m45s)



[so rich text box interesting do you not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m47s)



[have a default template no that can't be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h27m55s)



[right can it is it's just falling back](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m01s)



[into text box and reusing it no there's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m05s)



[that's got to be a documentation flaw oh](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m13s)



[and this is the problem with me just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m21s)



[talking away and not paying attention](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m24s)



[I've been on the wrong screen this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m25s)



[entire time well that's embarrassing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m27s)



[thank you I appreciate somebody pointing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m31s)



[that out I will probably want to go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m35s)



[through and edit this video I'm somewhat](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m39s)



[tempted to go through and kill the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m43s)



[recording and start over yeah](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m46s)



[I've been talking enough why throw away](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m49s)



[a good half hour of me talking though me](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m52s)



[clearly talking to myself I should not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m56s)



[have multiple scenes going](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h28m59s)



[how is the audio by the way is it decent](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m02s)



[I changed up my mic that I'm using for](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m05s)



[tonight and I'm hoping it comes out a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m09s)



[little bit better awesome that's what we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m11s)



[like to hear](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m14s)



[cool well if this is the case we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m16s)



[going on here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m24s)



[why are you confused](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m26s)



[I think resharper just has lost its mind](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m28s)



[on what resource dictionaries are being](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m30s)



[pulled in so rich text box let's just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m34s)



[look real quick object browser sort of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m41s)



[curious where so I'm not as familiar](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m54s)



[with the rich text box hierarchy I don't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h29m59s)



[remember where it is so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m07s)



[cheat so grab library types and go hunt](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m08s)



[it down thank you we'll just go look at](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m16s)



[it in the decompiled source real quick](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m21s)



[cuz it does derive from text box base](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m24s)



[which i think is going to make this a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m29s)



[lot easier because both text box and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m32s)



[text and rich text box have us common](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m35s)



[base class so we can probably leverage](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m38s)



[our existing style quite a bit to get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m44s)



[away with this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m50s)



[so let's start with this copy and paste](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h30m56s)



[little editor inheritance and we'll just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m05s)



[bring this guy down this guy down and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m12s)



[then we will just base this style on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m15s)



[base style text box base there we go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m20s)



[so most of these setters now become](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m35s)



[completely redundant but at least we've](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m38s)



[got a common template that we can work](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m40s)



[on and this may be all it takes to start](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m43s)



[enabling the rich text box so we'll get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m47s)



[one add it into our demo app that is and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m49s)



[then go from there so that makes the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h31m53s)



[default style pretty simple and then](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m01s)



[back over in our rich text box control](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m03s)



[I'll just bring in the other resource](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m08s)



[dictionary so we're already inside of a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m10s)



[resource dictionary so add to the merge](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m13s)



[dictionaries collection a source](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m15s)



[material design theme text box cool so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m20s)



[that brings in the base and then style](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m30s)



[target type rich text box based on tier](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m36s)



[design Mon text box base we should give](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m43s)



[this guy key what was the order we've](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m48s)



[been doing it first I think in the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m51s)



[interest of naming we just stick with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h32m56s)



[which text box now the last thing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m00s)



[because we've given these styles a key](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m04s)



[they aren't going to implicitly match on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m08s)



[the control type so the other place](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m11s)



[where we actually need to bring this in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m15s)



[is that defaults resource dictionary so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m16s)



[this guy has a whole bunch of stuff so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m22s)



[let's see let's keep it alphabetized so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m25s)



[that doesn't matter radio button we'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m29s)



[just bring in rich text box here that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m33s)



[and then down here all of these are now](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m38s)



[implicit styles and this is why when you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m43s)



[bring in this defaults dictionary your](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m45s)



[our entire app gets themed out](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m47s)



[appropriately](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m49s)



[this is the magic mapping between](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m50s)



[control type into the default style that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m53s)



[it needs so this started alphabetized we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h33m56s)



[might clean this up a little bit so I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m01s)



[can spell at least some days I can spell](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m04s)



[list view view comes after B so you guys](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m07s)



[up yeah that looks right let's see](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m14s)



[tooltip preview menu that's the other](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m20s)



[one let's move you up and then and let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m24s)



[see what do we got going on here so this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m34s)



[is a he'd style on the menu item](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m35s)



[separator style so this is there's a lot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m41s)



[of well-known resource keys that get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m45s)



[defined that get used by the system so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m48s)



[this is how the default separator looks](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m50s)



[it up I believe inside of like menus and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m53s)



[things like list box if you bring in a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m56s)



[separator is rather than just keen on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h34m59s)



[the type it has a an actual resource key](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m01s)



[so that that one style does imply to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m05s)



[everything but I think that gets us](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m07s)



[pretty close so in our case](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m09s)



[we just want to bring in rich text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m13s)



[here so rich text box see Court see no](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m15s)



[design let's see terrible design I can't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m31s)



[even remember which text box so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m38s)



[should now give us a default style there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m42s)



[okay let's go add one to our demo app](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m46s)



[and see how this works so text fields](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m49s)



[this is another one that probably needs](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m53s)



[to get broken up but that is a little](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m56s)



[beyond the scope of what we're doing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m58s)



[here so let's start up the demo and we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h35m59s)



[will take a look at where we've got](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m02s)



[space and get this one brought in so I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m07s)



[apologize for hiding my screen for the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m11s)



[first half hour for anyone tuning in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m14s)



[late so people who are interested it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m17s)



[this issue here for the to 600 release](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m20s)



[that we're looking to address of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m23s)



[bringing in a default style for the rich](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m25s)



[text box because right now if you add](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m27s)



[one to your app with this library you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m30s)



[just get the default WPF style which](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m33s)



[does not match the material design theme](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m36s)



[at all so we're looking to at least get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m38s)



[it get it pretty close](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m40s)



[while that's thinking about it we do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m43s)



[have sort of the the documentation for](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m46s)



[material design doesn't separate regular](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m49s)



[text boxes from rich text boxes so we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m53s)



[altima gonna try and leverage as much of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m55s)



[our existing styles as we can just to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h36m57s)



[get this same look and feel across the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m00s)



[board and then we'll maybe throw in a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m02s)



[couple hyperlinks or something inside of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m06s)



[it so that we can take a look at it so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m08s)



[this is I think where I'd probably want](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m15s)



[to put it because we've got a lot of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m19s)



[stuff going on in here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m22s)



[Oh interesting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m24s)



[these checkboxes are in here and they](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m29s)



[probably need to be moved into the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m33s)



[toggles page because now we've got two](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m35s)



[sets of checkboxes being shown off I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m38s)



[think that needs to be another issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m41s)



[real quick while we're while we're in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m44s)



[here and thinking about it let's go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m46s)



[ahead and log that so new issue so new](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m47s)



[issue merge check boxes onto new toggles](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h37m53s)



[page in demo app so I know that I know](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m04s)



[there are check boxes being in the text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m13s)



[fields page we should probably just add](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m21s)



[a quick link so anyone coming in here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m26s)



[can find it we will back out and grab](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m27s)



[the demo app and then it was the text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m33s)



[fields page and we'll put some spaces in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m39s)



[here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m49s)



[and the demo app these should be moved](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h38m56s)



[on to the new toggles view and we will](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m03s)



[add a link to that so that people know](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m12s)



[where it's going so back up and go down](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m15s)



[here to the toggles show that off and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m20s)



[see labels](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m31s)



[let's see good first issue so just for](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m33s)



[anybody watching if I tag an issue or](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m36s)



[with good first issue I want people to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m40s)



[feel very free to pick this up this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m43s)



[means that not only do I think that it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m46s)



[a reasonably low bar of entry it means](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m48s)



[that if you have any issues please feel](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m52s)

[people commenting or trying to work on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m56s)



[good first issues especially new](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h39m58s)



[committers are going to get my attention](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m00s)



[first because I want to try and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m03s)



[encourage as many people to be able to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m06s)



[contribute and bring forward as we and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m08s)



[help promote this project as we can so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m11s)



[just be aware if you see this on here it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m13s)



[is is definitely and the issue looks](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m15s)



[like something you want to do please](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m19s)



[pick it up and take a stab at it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m21s)



[okay so we'll slap that guy in there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m23s)



[submit new issue okay not to be too](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m26s)



[distracted now from where we were at but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m30s)



[I think what we are going to do for now](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m31s)



[is on this field section I think we'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m35s)



[just drop in a rich text box right](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m40s)



[underneath this multi-line and go from](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m45s)



[there does this guy is really just a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m46s)



[multi-line text box with spell checking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m50s)



[enabled](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m52s)



[yeah let's do that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m56s)



[because that's this guy right here so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h40m58s)



[what do we got grid Row 1 and then right](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m03s)



[below we got grid wrote](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m07s)



[so what is the element below at](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m10s)



[virtualize combo boxes so that jumps to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m12s)



[the other side that's the other reason](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m16s)



[to try and somewhat break up all of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m17s)



[these pages is these this gets rather](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m19s)



[complicated to go and add in more items](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m23s)



[especially the bigger this gets so not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m25s)



[you not you you're looking for which](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m28s)



[allows combo boxes there you are](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m37s)



[so all of these items here are all stuff](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m39s)



[that's hanging out on the left side](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m43s)



[between here and here so probably some](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m45s)



[useful areas to go through and reorder](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m49s)



[things but see about cleaning this up a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m51s)



[little bit it's really I want to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h41m56s)



[virtualize combo boxes is in Row 3 and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m01s)



[this guy's in Row 1 which i think is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m05s)



[actually really convenient because that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m07s)



[leaves us a nice opportunity to just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m10s)



[bump something oh this is rowspan -](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m13s)



[that's why that's why this guy's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m16s)



[spanning a couple rows and being pushed](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m19s)



[down so he's spanning rows 1 & 2 and we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m22s)



[want to effectively push this guy all](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m25s)



[the way down well okay I guess we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m27s)



[gonna have to do that so let's let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m34s)



[just bite it off now so this is going to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m37s)



[need to be a new unique key but we'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m40s)



[get to that in a minute](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m42s)



[so let's do this you're gonna become a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m47s)



[three grid wristband grid column that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m50s)



[whole thing there that'll be fine](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m54s)



[so we need to hunt for things that are](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h42m57s)



[in column 4 which is going to be this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m01s)



[right hand column for us so this guy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m03s)



[needs to bump down to a row 5 see I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m06s)



[think we've broken our lives amyl](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m13s)



[editing which isn't too surprising this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m15s)



[control does some fancy stuff at build](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m18s)



[time so there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m21s)



[that guy who's been pushed down was the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m23s)



[next one below it disabled controls](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m26s)



[let's see tight space validation so we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m34s)



[past disabled controls some where are](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m38s)



[you why did it not show up is it in a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m43s)



[different I'm disabled so it's got to be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m48s)



[in here text block disabled controls so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m52s)



[what did your parent ah got it so it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h43m58s)



[actually inside of this same stack panel](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m04s)



[that might be okay actually so if that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m10s)



[gets pushed down and he's the only one](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m15s)



[there so let's see he went five he's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m18s)



[gonna span three so that puts him taking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m24s)



[up five six and seven so this guy should](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m27s)



[be eight I believe and he's only gonna](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m32s)



[take one which makes puts him at nine](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m41s)



[and then everything's lined up correctly](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m47s)



[so stop here for a moment and we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m51s)



[going to switch you over to a rich text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h44m59s)



[box and so yeah we've got some got some](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m04s)



[stuff going on that isn't gonna quite](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m10s)



[line up with everything but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m13s)



[let's give that a shot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m21s)



[oh boy so it is unhappy about this type](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m30s)



[converter because it doesn't know what](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m41s)



[to do with the content so we'll just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m43s)



[leave it empty for the moment we'll come](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m45s)



[back to putting some content in there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m49s)



[because ultimately I think we'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m55s)



[probably do some more lorem ipsum but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h45m57s)



[we'll do something with you know bold](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m00s)



[italics and hyperlinks or whatnot in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m02s)



[here just to show that the rich text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m04s)



[looks and acts the way one would expect](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m06s)



[okay so let's come back over here to our](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m21s)



[fields see how badly we've messed this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m23s)



[up target type does not match template](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m26s)



[type rich text box so that means that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m33s)



[back over here in our text box we change](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m39s)



[the style target but the template is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m46s)



[still targeting text box so let's do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m52s)



[this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m55s)



[and see if there's any fallout from it I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h46m57s)



[think we might just get away with it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m04s)



[which would be really nice the more of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m13s)



[this we can just offload and reuse](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m15s)



[better](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m18s)



[I think this is probably I don't think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m32s)



[there's much if anything in this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m36s)



[template that's using properties that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m38s)



[directly exist on text box and not on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m41s)



[text box base will hopefully get away](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m43s)



[with with doing this but we might have](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m51s)



[to customize it a little bit we may end](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m53s)



[up having to add a few additional styles](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m56s)



[on the various inline elements that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h47m59s)



[exist inside of a rich text box so text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m03s)



[fields not implemented exception so text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m08s)



[hint proxy so we've got the hint stuff](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m18s)



[that's that's now going to be broken as](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m21s)



[well so what is it what is it about you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m24s)



[that requires a text box and can I get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m27s)



[away with a text box base because that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m29s)



[would be really convenient if I could](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m36s)



[get away with your base class instead](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m38s)



[so that is going to be a problem okay so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m47s)



[we'll have to write a new one of these](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m51s)



[rich text box but we'll take advantage](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m53s)



[of the newer syntax in line that guy in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h48m58s)



[proxy fabric](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m02s)



[so let's just duplicate this guy over](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m12s)



[here real quick and we will do the rich](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m16s)



[text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m21s)



[let's see here got to make sure whenever](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m30s)



[I copy these files it's very easy to get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m32s)



[yourself in a situation where you don't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m34s)



[pay too close attention and you end up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m37s)



[editing the wrong file I've done that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m41s)



[all too many times so when this guy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m46s)



[becomes a rich text box and let's bounce](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m49s)



[back to the hint proxy fabric and we'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m53s)



[just add this guy in here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h49m58s)



[this feels like something that could be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h50m12s)



[done a little cleaner let's see here so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h50m14s)



[what do you do in proxy can build build](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h50m26s)



[build err this builders is just a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h50m33s)



[straight list this is just doing a tight](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h50m41s)



[check and then a straight up comparison](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h50m48s)



[I am tempted to switch this out but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m05s)



[we'll come back to it at a later point](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m07s)



[because there is a fun trick you can do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m12s)



[with dynamic and typing but this is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m14s)



[actually grabbing derived classes too](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m18s)



[and I don't want to don't accidentally](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m20s)



[switch the behavior when I'm not ready](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m22s)



[for it so this guy I believe has well](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m24s)



[it's just what is this content used for](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m30s)



[can I just kick back it's looking for an](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m33s)



[arbitrary document let's the content](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m35s)



[content obsolete so this guy is going to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m39s)



[be going away at some point](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m47s)



[it's a spelling error there while we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m53s)



[in here so if that guy is going to be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m56s)



[obsolete](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h51m58s)



[let's just preemptively make our life](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m00s)



[easy and not use him do wonder why this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m03s)



[interface is public](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m13s)



[given that the implementations are all](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m15s)



[private the minimum it feels like](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m17s)



[something that should move to be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m21s)



[internal but that's probably why this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m22s)



[hasn't been removed the obsolete members](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m24s)



[will likely get cleaned up in the three](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m26s)



[oh release because at that point we can](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m29s)



[do breaking changes so now we need to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m31s)



[check if this guy is empty or not so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m34s)



[let's start with this yeah some of these](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m38s)



[members like the is loaded are on the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m40s)



[base control and we could probably](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m42s)



[consolidate a lot of this logic come](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m44s)



[back to that at a different point don't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m49s)



[name every name related just this guy is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m51s)



[fine thank you so let's jump in here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h52m53s)



[how do we tell if a rich text book is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m00s)



[empty](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m02s)



[I think the document has a concept of a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m03s)



[length how do we did check this is empty](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m07s)



[it's utilize background so we could look](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m15s)



[at the text pointer I suppose we could](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m25s)



[just define if to start in the end or](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m32s)



[pointing to the same location then this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m34s)



[thing is empty the problem being that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m36s)



[the the text box one treats empty](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m41s)



[strings so for example if we jump back](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m45s)



[over here and look at this guy's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m46s)



[implementation it defines it as null or](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m49s)



[empty string](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m53s)



[I guess space characters are fine so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m54s)



[yeah we should be able to just do if](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h53m58s)



[document contents start equals content](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h54m02s)



[and then it's empty](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h54m11s)



[this just works](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h54m23s)



[cool so that should fix the hint fabric](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h54m33s)



[stuff okay let's try again](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h54m37s)



[see what we got](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m16s)



[hey we're loaded look at that now I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m22s)



[believe Fuu we now have fold a text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m28s)



[italicize text look at that that's what](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m37s)



[we wanted there is this hint assist so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m43s)



[let's pull this guy out what does this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m52s)



[guy do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m54s)



[what's our line text we aren't getting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h55m54s)



[our hint to display which I suspect is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m01s)



[probably I'm gonna do with that hemp](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m06s)



[fabric that we just wrote so I believe](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m10s)



[this is empty call is what is the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m13s)



[trigger for this content start](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m15s)



[oh let's see evaluate this so even](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m22s)



[though it's empty the start and the end](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m26s)



[are not pointed at the same thing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m27s)



[so let's look at what we've got on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m41s)



[document and see if there's another way](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m43s)



[we can get at this information it might](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m45s)



[be a little bit easier let's see that's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m48s)



[just padding with just over text effects](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h56m57s)



[okay so this this check here is not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m07s)



[going to work for us just disappointing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m09s)



[content start oh there is a compare to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m13s)



[okay well let's just try this real quick](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m31s)



[because this might make our life a lot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m36s)



[easier](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m40s)



[is there an overridden equals because](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m41s)



[that would be a little cleaner still](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m43s)



[doesn't look like it so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m46s)



[stick with this for now stick with this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m49s)



[for now and see if this gives us our our](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m52s)



[hint that we're looking for and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h57m55s)



[hopefully this gets will do a do up the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m02s)



[demo with like I said some various text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m05s)



[formatting with bold italics and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m09s)



[hyperlinks and then we will see what](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m11s)



[happens](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m14s)



[because that might get us pretty close](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m23s)



[in that way at least people who want to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m27s)



[use rich text boxes in their app](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m29s)



[which is interesting when you get to the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m45s)



[end it adds in that extra little space](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m48s)



[and that cursor position is actually not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m54s)



[aligned there is that the same problem](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h58m59s)



[we have here it's actually worse here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m02s)



[because this doesn't even show the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m09s)



[cursor I think there may be an open](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m11s)



[issue for this I know we fixed various](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m15s)



[issues around cursor position and margin](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m17s)



[and this guy down here clearly breaks it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m21s)



[in a different way okay](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m24s)



[but once again we still have this issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m29s)



[of when I clear all the text let's take](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m31s)



[a look](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m36s)



[WPF get so I'd like to boil it down to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m41s)



[just a straight string element and take](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m51s)



[a look at what is what is the content in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=00h59m56s)



[there so let's see you grab it as a text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m01s)



[range](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m13s)



[got it and use the content an end](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m21s)



[pointer and then from the text range you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m23s)



[can pull it off got it got it got it got](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m25s)



[it got it anything else in here I should](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m28s)



[know about so it does handle Mouse](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m30s)



[events great and it uses RTF not HTML](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m35s)



[that's not a library problem that's just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m45s)



[a WPF issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m48s)



[Tech one touch has changed which I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h00m59s)



[believe that is the that is the same](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m02s)



[event that we're watching here which is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m06s)



[great we are using the text change](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m07s)



[handler and this guy here perfect so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m13s)



[let's let's grab this guy kill execution](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m20s)



[real quick and we're gonna let's see](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m24s)



[pull in the text range please let's grab](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m34s)



[which text box and rich text box now I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m40s)



[am curious if this is me if this text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m48s)



[range is mutable because creating one of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m51s)



[these every single time could get rather](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m54s)



[expensive](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h01m56s)



[interesting and interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m13s)



[interesting interesting okay well we may](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m14s)



[be stuck doing this but so will return](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m18s)



[there's no or empty text range text I'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m24s)



[be curious what this does knowing that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m33s)



[when we were just back spacing through](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m36s)



[we were getting the start and end being](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m38s)



[separated by one character and I assume](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m41s)



[that it's that this might give me a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m43s)



[space character but I really don't know](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h02m46s)



[come on little compiler you can do it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m00s)



[you can do it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m03s)



[okay so let's go back to our text fields](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m11s)



[take a look](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m14s)



[so that doesn't instill a lot of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m18s)



[confidence in me so it's the same issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m20s)



[we run into the when we've backspace](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m25s)



[through everything leaves an empty space](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m29s)



[there interesting I'm tempted for this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m36s)



[guy to check for an ignore white space](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m46s)



[on top of it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h03m53s)



[okay could become a bar clean you up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m03s)



[clean you up yeah I am I'm very tempted](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m07s)



[to try and clean some of this stuff up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m27s)



[the other thing is a lot of these events](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m30s)



[are going to be firing rapidly I am](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m32s)



[wondering if we're eating too much of a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m36s)



[performance hit by doing this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m38s)



[that would be unfortunate oh joy okay](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h04m51s)



[let's take another look here that works](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m02s)



[I do have this issue of a cursor](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m10s)



[position I think that's probably the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m16s)



[next bigger issue so let's see about](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m18s)



[dealing with that so everybody's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m25s)



[favorite WPF UI debugging utility snoop](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m29s)



[which has just recently moved into a new](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m37s)



[org on github but this is by far one of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m40s)



[the best UI debugging utilities if](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m44s)



[you're doing any WPF development I not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m48s)



[imagine doing it without using snoop so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m50s)



[real quick just a quick search WPF snoop](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m54s)



[and you can grab it from I think this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h05m58s)



[one here will forward to the new one](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m04s)



[yeah so the link on being is old but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m06s)



[it's being forwarded it's now under the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m10s)



[snoop WPF org and you can just grab it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m12s)



[straight from there releases page and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m16s)



[grab the download for it once you get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m19s)



[snoop fire it up there's you'll get a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m22s)



[little blue bar like this guy right here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m26s)



[what you want to do is grab the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m28s)



[magnifying glass I'll just shut this guy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m30s)



[down real quick and just drag it over](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m32s)



[anywhere on any window for the app that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m34s)



[you want to snoop and so what it ends up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m37s)



[doing is it injects itself into the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m39s)



[running process and fires up one of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m41s)



[these windows and because it's running](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m44s)



[inside of the same memory space as the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m45s)



[current process it has access to the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m48s)



[entire visual tree and can let you snoop](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m50s)



[through it in addition it can let you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m53s)



[modify properties this is one of the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m56s)



[kind of big differences between the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h06m59s)



[snoop and the built-in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m01s)



[ones](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m03s)



[noop you have a lot more control over](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m05s)



[what you can edit and see change in real](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m07s)



[time the visual studio one has the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m10s)



[advantage of when you make an edit a lot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m12s)



[of times if it can find the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m14s)



[corresponding source code it'll update](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m15s)



[your source code for you as well so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m17s)



[there's a minor win there but overall I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m19s)



[have to say I'm a much I like using](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m22s)



[Steve better than the visual studio ones](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m25s)



[the other thing you can do is once you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m27s)



[have snoop running holding down control](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m30s)



[and shift and just moving your mouse](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m32s)



[over the control that you want you can](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m35s)



[see that border that goes and selects it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m37s)



[we can now dive in and it'll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m40s)



[automatically select all the way into](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m43s)



[the visual tree for whatever element was](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m44s)



[under your cursor it is worth knowing it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m46s)



[will only do it where elements are hit](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m49s)



[testable so if you've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m51s)



[like hidden or non-hit testable elements](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m54s)



[there it won't necessarily select the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h07m58s)



[element that you want so that's a WPF](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m00s)



[issue not really a snoo problem but just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m03s)



[be aware that if you can't find it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m06s)



[sometimes you have to select a nearby](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m07s)



[element and kind of drive through the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m08s)



[tree to find it so well we're interested](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m10s)



[in is figuring out why this cursor and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m13s)



[this hint are not aligned and I have a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m18s)



[feeling the answer lives in here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m23s)



[specifically with this hint to control](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m26s)



[so this guy is getting set and clearly](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m29s)



[the cursors position is getting pushed](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m33s)



[over so but that grid and that border](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m36s)



[question is where is that guy coming](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m41s)



[from so this comes in here this comes in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m44s)



[here and I believe I'm not mistaken the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m47s)



[cursor is in here somewhere and this is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h08m58s)



[probably it's probably buried and this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m00s)



[that with the difference in the visual](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m04s)



[tree with the rich text box control I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m06s)



[suspect is the container visual and so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m10s)



[specifically what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m14s)



[I'm just going to bring this over in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m16s)



[this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m17s)



[roll this so we can have a little more](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m18s)



[screen real estate this bar up here lets](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m20s)



[you filter the properties and so I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m23s)



[suspect that the problem is probably](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m25s)



[either with a Mart something that has](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m27s)



[margin in the name or something that is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m29s)



[padding in the name so I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m31s)



[assume it's likely one of those two](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m34s)



[things given that this guy is offset](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m36s)



[could be something else but this is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m39s)



[probably a fair starting point the other](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m41s)



[thing to note is snoop will pull in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m46s)



[attached properties this doesn't mean](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m47s)



[that the control is actually leveraging](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m50s)



[these attached properties at all so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m52s)



[these can sometimes be red herrings so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m53s)



[don't get too lost in the weeds on some](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m56s)



[of the ones that have class name dot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h09m58s)

[can assume that it's probably being](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h10m11s)

[that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h10m47s)



[Oh noticing that there's no kind of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h10m47s)



[looking for that red border once you've](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h10m54s)



[selected something that usually gives](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h10m58s)



[you a pretty good indication so that's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m00s)



[interesting that that load document is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m03s)



[that so let's see windows plus what is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m10s)



[it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m18s)



[what is the just go grab magnifier it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m29s)



[somewhere in here but I expect to find](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m36s)



[it it's my magnifier window there you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m40s)



[are there's your hot key is your hot key](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m45s)



[Windows key plus so they must be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m54s)



[hijacking my there we go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h11m57s)



[that might be our culprit](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m07s)



[this guy here I don't see margin or](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m21s)



[padding this has got a margin on the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m26s)



[right edge nothing to there it's gotta](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m30s)



[be something around this guy let's take](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m40s)



[a look so that guy has a width of 563](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m46s)



[562 that's the one pixel that was set on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m51s)



[the right margin that was doing that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h12m55s)



[oh you know if I remember right there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m08s)



[was look at this control real quick this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m11s)



[guy here has a text view text box view](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m15s)



[yeah I think this is probably the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m22s)



[difference I think it's less that text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m26s)



[view assist text view box margin maybe](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m34s)



[not I assume that this attached property](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m41s)



[because I know it on property change](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m44s)



[this guy drills through the visual tree](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m46s)



[so if we go and look over here so let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m48s)



[see text you know the Syst just get you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h13m51s)



[out of my way magnifier this guy down](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m01s)



[here has a property changed call back](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m07s)



[and on his property changed it goes](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m11s)



[hunting through this guy and apply text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m15s)



[box you margin and it's going hunting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m25s)



[for this content host which it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m27s)



[probably finding let's look](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m35s)



[part content host so it's finding this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m45s)



[scroll viewer right here right](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m48s)



[and it's probably finding the same thing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m51s)



[over here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h14m54s)



[differences this guy I don't think we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m04s)



[want textfield grid scroll viewer and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m07s)



[then this guy comes into play I think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m18s)



[it's making assumptions about the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m22s)



[contents that get put inside of this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m24s)



[scroll viewer because you'll notice in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m27s)



[one case we're getting a flow document](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m29s)



[view and in the other case it's just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m31s)



[going to contain the grid or the text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m36s)



[box for you it's probably in here so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m41s)



[what did this modify so it finds the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m48s)



[scroll viewer that has the name part](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m52s)



[content host grabs the content out of it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m55s)



[as a framework element and applies a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h15m58s)



[margin to that framework element let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m02s)



[jump back here so this guy is the direct](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m06s)



[child of it part content host this guy](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m11s)



[is the direct child interesting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m16s)



[the content got applied down here there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m25s)



[must be a template between those two](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m29s)



[same thing applies here so this must be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m31s)



[the template on the scroll viewer why](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m35s)



[these guys get skipped and this is the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m39s)



[direct content of it okay](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m41s)



[so this guy gets it and this guy gets it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m44s)



[but this guy clearly is offset flow](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m50s)



[document of you where's that guy is not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h16m55s)



[so we really want to do is shape that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m00s)



[hint over shift that cursor over I'm not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m09s)



[entirely sure why this one is so 562 but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m15s)



[what is this grid 563 so this flow](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m21s)



[document view is roughly as because I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m29s)



[was expect](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m31s)



[so why is that cursor position off](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m38s)



[because normally the cursor position is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m44s)



[contained inside of here what do you do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h17m47s)



[desired size effects and floating offset](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m01s)



[just see if this works not completely](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m13s)



[not at least with a quick runtime change](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m20s)



[at least okay so back to the cursor this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m23s)



[view item padding hides default style](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m28s)



[textblock margin nothing except on the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m41s)



[right one pixel doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m46s)



[virtualizing width and interesting okay](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h18m51s)



[I am not entirely clear why those things](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m06s)



[are not aligning so I would prefer to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m10s)



[get that cursor to shift all the way](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m15s)



[over let's see here so you're with but](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m17s)



[there's a this view item you port](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m24s)



[height width 15 6 5 6 to 15 so 2 4 so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m42s)



[there's something that's adding or](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m56s)



[subtracting from that scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h19m59s)



[look at the containing grid 15 562 62 5](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m11s)



[6 3](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m20s)



[five six three](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m27s)



[Oh interesting this guy is much smaller](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m38s)



[or as the other one is larger so this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m42s)



[border why are you shrinking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m48s)



[show me your vertical the climate's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m52s)



[stretch this is probably indicative of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h20m56s)



[the fact that this was empty bottom I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m03s)



[suspect these align now at least](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m10s)



[size-wise I'm just trying to hunt down](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m14s)



[where these size differences are coming](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m16s)



[from yeah so those two both pick up the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m18s)



[same so the difference has to come down](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m21s)



[to this flow document view](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m25s)



[let's take a look here hello](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m42s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m45s)



[document view](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m46s)



[where is this guy she not exist outside](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h21m56s)



[oh he is a Microsoft internal class okay](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m02s)



[wondering if current target wish there](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m17s)



[was an easy way I'd love to be able to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m28s)



[walk up its type hierarchy without doing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m32s)



[too much work so selected I haven't used](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m36s)



[this repple much](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m44s)



[not entirely sure how it's expected to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m54s)



[work selected okay that's better](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h22m57s)



[selected get type](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m10s)



[visual item](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m25s)



[container item this looks like I'm](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m33s)



[falling into not quite what I want like](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m36s)



[let's do this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m44s)



[selected visual get type name flow](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m48s)



[document view there we go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h23m56s)



[so it's just a framework element huh](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m02s)



[okay that doesn't have this repple is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m06s)



[actually rather nice I like that I have](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m10s)



[not made use of it before and I need to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m15s)



[make more use of that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m18s)



[so let's go back here real quick and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m28s)



[let's take a look at our template and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m31s)



[see what exactly it is we're setting on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m34s)



[this so inside of our control template](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m36s)



[we can hide the visual state manager so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m39s)



[we've got our border which is fine just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m43s)



[a hover border text field border this is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m47s)



[the guy that we're actually interested](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m52s)



[in he contains a grid whose sole purpose](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h24m54s)



[is just to contain a bunch of stuff so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m01s)



[he contains the bottom line border](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m03s)



[disabled line border the underlying](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m07s)



[control but this border contains the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m09s)



[actual content this is our text field](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m11s)



[grid he does have padding that gets set](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m14s)



[this is top and bottom padding that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m20s)



[shouldn't make a difference for the left](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m25s)



[and right issue that we're dealing with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m27s)



[and then we fall straight into scroll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m29s)



[viewer which is just fine so let's go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m33s)



[back here and take a look so what](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m40s)



[happens on this guy oh hello document if](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m42s)



[this guy hypothetically starts picking](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m50s)



[up a margin like let's go big 25 so the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h25m52s)



[cursor moves with him okay](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m00s)



[I'm wondering what happens if we do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m05s)



[negative 4](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m09s)



[well that looks a lot closer doesn't it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m20s)



[another scrollbar does I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m35s)



[maybe we just apply a negative margin of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m45s)



[minus 4 to that guy so this guy was](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m48s)



[using the text field text field view](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m52s)



[margin so let's take this guy come over](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h26m57s)



[to our rich text box and let's just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m00s)



[adjust him backwards because I am not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m03s)



[entirely clear why he's offset but we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m06s)



[can do this we can import the needed](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m12s)



[types make this a minus 4 so now it's a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m16s)



[little different from the other one and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m18s)



[now it should just work hide that for](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m21s)



[now](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m25s)



[so get us at least a good step](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m31s)



[I think the last thing is gonna be to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m43s)



[get do they have a good sample text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m45s)



[this isn't real helpful but this'll do](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h27m58s)



[I'll just grab some inline elements and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m07s)



[slap them in let's see here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m11s)



[fields](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m19s)



[there that's a little bit nicer](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m37s)



[so spell-checking should also work great](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m43s)



[was something that it should be able to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m52s)



[figure out great okay that gets that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h28m58s)



[going](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m06s)



[so let's come back up here just grab the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m07s)



[same bit of text this guy's going to be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m17s)



[unhappy if we just dump the text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m20s)



[straight in we need to figure out the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m21s)



[actual number for this so on the Sam](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m25s)



[will display controls these keys just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m27s)



[have to be unique at some point I may go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m30s)



[through and update that library so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m33s)



[it auto generates these keys but for now](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m34s)



[it just insists on unique values so like](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m36s)



[I think fields 32 is unique so you'll be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m42s)



[number 32 great](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m51s)



[so that's unique in this document and so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m53s)



[we're gonna paste this stuff in I think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h29m57s)



[if we do wrap it in a run and hope you a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h30m02s)

[this text a little bit and call this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h30m57s)



[rich text box and let's just let's clear](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h31m00s)



[this up we're gonna we're gonna do some](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h31m08s)



[fancier formatting here so font weight](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h31m10s)

[let's look real quick how do those](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h32m00s)



[documentation links fire off they just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h32m03s)

[me pull this up and I'll kind of walk](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m10s)



[back a little bit so the material design](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m12s)



[in zamel toolkit we're working on the to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m15s)



[six oh release and specifically right](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m19s)



[now this toolkit doesn't have a style](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m22s)



[for the the rich text box so we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m25s)



[looking to get one implemented in the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m30s)



[demo in the demo app for it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m34s)



[so getting basically a simple style](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m36s)



[there was already a built-in template](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m40s)



[for the text box and so we're heavily](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m43s)



[leveraging the existing controls that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m46s)



[are there and that's kind of where we're](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m48s)



[at and so at this point just trying to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m51s)



[get the demo for this to have some](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m54s)



[useful stuff which is over here so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h33m58s)



[it can actually show off that we have a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m03s)



[well styled rich text box if that helps](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m06s)



[you I need to figure out how to bring](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m09s)



[this guy over I hope that answers the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m15s)



[question but yeah if you've got any](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m19s)



[questions on the library or WPF feel](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m20s)



[free to ask them I'm always happy to to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m23s)

[something is useful to people so so](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m27s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m33s)



[navigate you or I will be will have to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m34s)



[come up with something](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m40s)



[we'll just navigate back to our project](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m45s)



[page while I'm thinking about it that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m47s)



[sounds like a great place to navigate](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h34m50s)

[text with formatting hyperlink is not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h35m50s)



[clickable and not showing up the way I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h35m57s)



[would expect something on the back of my](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h35m59s)



[mind is telling me that that's normal](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m05s)



[and I have to set something to actually](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m07s)



[make it clickable so let's let's adjust](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m10s)



[and take a little we'll just snip this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m14s)



[guy real quick and see what's going on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m16s)



[come on fine the control there we go](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m22s)



[dive into the control so they're shift](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m26s)



[that over a little bit so see scroll](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m32s)

[text controls get very big very fast](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m45s)



[line visual alright because those things](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m48s)



[are not full elements let's jump back](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m51s)



[here real quick I think it's the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h36m58s)



[property on this guy believe there is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m04s)



[something you have to actually set on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m08s)



[the hyperlinks to make them clickable](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m10s)



[when they're inside of a rich text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m12s)



[don't think that's it but no I think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m21s)



[it's on the text box the rich text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m29s)



[itself take a quick gander up here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m31s)



[let's see out a word selection we'll ask](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m36s)



[the Google when in doubt Google it with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m46s)



[Bing let's see here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m49s)



[WPF text box something yeah I feel like](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h37m53s)



[I've looked at these before is document](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m09s)



[and enabled let's take a quick peek](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m16s)

[click Handler and see what's going on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m42s)



[make sure we're actually getting into](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m45s)



[here that enabled the hyperlink but it](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m47s)



[still doesn't appear to be picking up](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m55s)



[the that it's also bothering me that the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h38m57s)



[cursor does not switch to the hand like](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m01s)



[you would expect for make it look like a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m07s)



[hyperlink this might just be an issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m15s)



[with our live zamel editing so we will](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m18s)



[bounce over and see what it take see if](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m22s)



[it was just the live example updating](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m28s)



[occasionally when there's issues you can](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m30s)



[only mostly trust the live sam'l update](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m33s)



[it does a pretty good job but because](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m35s)



[it's always updating it's very easy to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m38s)



[get your running application into an](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m40s)

[need to throw in the towel and restart](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m44s)



[and always throw in the towel and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m46s)



[restart before committing code never](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m48s)



[trust an intermediate state that you got](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m53s)



[to with lives and let it because it may](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m55s)



[not match the end result still not quite](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h39m57s)



[getting me where I'm looking for this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m06s)



[guy claims that there's two solutions](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m16s)



[don't believe this guy actually contains](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m33s)



[a little the lot of times you can get](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m35s)



[yourself into trouble trying to google](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m39s)



[for these things because the windows](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m41s)



[forms also contains a rich text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m44s)



[control and so you'll get a lot of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m50s)



[search results that end up landing](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m53s)



[landing there let's see so left mouse](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h40m55s)



[button down so text link quest navigate](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m05s)



[oh is that did I just wire up on the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m19s)



[wrong event oh that that could be your](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m21s)



[problem right there so let's go with](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m27s)



[this quest navigate go ahead and create](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m29s)



[me a new one just out of curiosity you](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m34s)



[do have that on there so we'll just just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m40s)



[grab that guy because now we don't need](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m44s)



[to go back to the hyperlink we can just](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m46s)



[do grab it straight off the event args](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m49s)



[just a little bit nicer okay so format](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m52s)



[that clean that up that gets us a little](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h41m59s)



[closer this goes away still not sure why](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m03s)



[my cursor is not getting said I have a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m10s)



[hunch actually when in doubt make the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m13s)



[color bright and obnoxious that way I](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m21s)



[don't accidentally forget about it and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m23s)



[leave it checked in but I have a hunch](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m25s)



[sometimes when your cursor or any kind](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m28s)



[of mouse over or hover isn't triggering](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m31s)



[it comes to do with the hitbox on a lot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m34s)



[of controls because by default the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m38s)



[background isn't set to transparent it's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m40s)



[set up as](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m44s)



[unset' which means the the point that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m45s)



[your cursor is over falls all the way](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m49s)



[through to the control below it and](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m51s)



[sometimes that's not quite what you want](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m53s)



[you'll find that a lot with text-based](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m56s)



[controls where your cursor changes still](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h42m59s)



[not opening breakpoint and the cursor is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m05s)



[okay so what did you do here so that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m16s)



[there it's guy ended up setting a style](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m22s)



[on the hyperlink to get the cursor to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m26s)



[switch over to the hand so that's not a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m29s)



[bad option but I'm hard-coding it on](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m31s)



[there a little surprised that the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m36s)



[request navigating on this doesn't work](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m43s)



[doesn't work when it when it's inside of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m48s)



[a rich text box maybe maybe that is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m54s)



[expected I don't believe this has](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h43m59s)



[anything to do with this library I think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m02s)



[it is I think this is just an example of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m06s)



[an issue with WPF and the default rich](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m11s)



[text box control layout so let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m15s)



[actually go it's really just surprised](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m18s)



[me that this that this guy here is not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m22s)



[applying](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m28s)



[so let's do wonder if the read-only bit](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m36s)



[is the kicker oh look at that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m42s)



[there it is doesn't fall through unless](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m51s)



[is read only is set interesting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h44m55s)



[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m02s)



[interesting so let's take the background](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m03s)



[off that shouldn't matter anymore let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m08s)



[throw in another line break here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m13s)



[demo an app and it's happy to launch](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m21s)



[great](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m29s)



[hmm](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m37s)



[problem being is now I obviously cannot](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m44s)



[edit it I kind of want both](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m47s)



[I don't want both so I think what we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m51s)



[should do is just add in the option of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h45m55s)



[editing right here so inside of this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m00s)



[let's do grid it's probably gonna be](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m06s)



[really unhappy with me so let's go ahead](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m16s)



[and kill execution for the moment let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m18s)



[see vertical alignment stretch isn't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m21s)



[gonna matter anymore so get rid of that](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m23s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m28s)



[once you probably still matter let's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m30s)



[just format these guys right on in](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m38s)



[after seeing my multiple cursors are not](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m56s)



[working I'll have to figure out why](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h46m58s)



[okay so let's just do a checkbox here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h47m10s)



[content rich text box is read-only](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h47m16s)



[a text box check box that's a nice long](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h47m34s)



[verbose name and we will default it is](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h47m42s)



[checked we're gonna start off its true](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h47m48s)

[gonna stage that guy let's see what we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h57m33s)



[did in the code behind so code behind](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h57m37s)



[whitespace cleanup and we added a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h57m46s)

[for the rich text box again I think](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h57m59s)



[there's probably some cleanup that can](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h58m02s)

[reordered some of these items down here](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h58m52s)



[and then most importantly we created an](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h58m55s)



[implicit style targeting the rich text](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h58m57s)

[fine still a little confused as to where](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m22s)



[that extra margins coming from we](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m25s)



[created we technically created a new](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m28s)



[style called material design text box](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m30s)



[base because it's targeting the base](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m33s)



[text box which is the parent type for](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m36s)



[both text box and rich text box updated](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m40s)

[changed this guy to just reference the](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m46s)



[material design text box base control](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m51s)



[that way anybody who's still using this](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m54s)



[style everything still works so there's](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=01h59m56s)

[request gets merged it'll automatically](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h01m28s)



[close the issue](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h01m30s)



[so we'll just tag that guy up we know](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h01m31s)

[system is working there's not a lot of](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h02m11s)



[unit tests and I wouldn't expect this to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h02m12s)



[fail but just in the event we forgot to](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h02m16s)



[commit something or something doesn't](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h02m18s)



[line up it's always best to verify a](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h02m20s)



[minimum you compile on another machine](https://youtu.be/IOex7ZT_OFg?t=02h02m23s)
