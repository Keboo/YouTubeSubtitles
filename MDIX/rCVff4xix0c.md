[00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:16,389](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m07s)

okay we're gonna get started here so I


[00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,829](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m12s)

apologize for everybody this stream was


[00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m16s)

a little bit last-minute I ended up


[00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m17s)

having some free time this evening and


[00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m20s)

decided that I would spend it and get


[00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m22s)

some work done and do a little live


[00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:33,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m24s)

streaming so going to be doing material


[00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m28s)

design in zamel again tonight my normal


[00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m33s)

Thursday stream I had some requests to


[00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m34s)

do more system command line work so


[00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m37s)

that's going to be on Thursday but I


[00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m40s)

didn't want to let the material design


[00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m43s)

work stuff slip and since I had free


[00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m45s)

time I figured I would powwow on that a


[00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m48s)

little bit tonight and see about


[00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,419](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m50s)

knocking out some more pull requests and


[00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m53s)

getting some issues resolved and we'll


[00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m55s)

see how far we get on that tonight so


[00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h04m57s)

for people who are looking for more


[00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m00s)

zamel this will be for you tonight for


[00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m02s)

people who are wanting to do more of the


[00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m03s)

command line stuff that will be on


[00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m06s)

Thursday I'm doing it at 9 p.m. Pacific


[00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m09s)

so I don't know what that translates for


[00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:19,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m12s)

in your timezone so let's get going here


[00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m17s)

and we'll flip over to my other one I


[00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m19s)

also have a new camera set up that I'm


[00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m21s)

I'm playing with so we'll see how it


[00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,669](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m24s)

goes so there's been several pull


[00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m27s)

requests that have come in and there's


[00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m30s)

been some issues and questions this one


[00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m33s)

here I'm hoping is a quick and simple


[00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:43,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m36s)

one to take a look at it looked like it


[00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m40s)

was just a change to go through and do


[00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m43s)

some of the open collective stuff I know


[00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m45s)

in the past people have asked if there


[00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m48s)

is a way for them to support this


[00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m50s)

library or donate if you're interested


[00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m53s)

the open collective is the new way that


[00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m55s)

we've set up to do it for a long time


[00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:04,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h05m56s)

the old donation link was dead so and I


[00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m00s)

believe this link is correct let's just


[00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m04s)

verify that because there there was a


[00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m06s)

comment on the poll request that the


[00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m08s)

description and the issue didn't match


[00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m10s)

the the link that was set and so I think


[00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m13s)

I can't remember whether it's material


[00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m15s)

designs an old toolkit or just material


[00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m17s)

design


[00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:26,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m18s)

saml will fire this up and make sure and


[00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:30,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m22s)

I think this was the issue is should


[00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:33,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m26s)

just be that let's make sure this guy


[00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:38,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m30s)

actually fires up and works ah huzzah


[00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m33s)

there we go okay so and I think that was


[00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m38s)

probably the issue that was mentioned


[00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m39s)

here yeah is that the issue mentions it


[00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m42s)

at this link


[00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m43s)

but the commit actually targets this


[00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m46s)

link which if this is true this is fine


[00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m48s)

because this is what the real link is


[00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m51s)

that we're going for so just take a


[00:06:53,890 --> 00:07:01,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m53s)

quick peek through this and make sure


[00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:07,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h06m55s)

that it is in fact in here so this drops


[00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:10,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m01s)

in a backers great trying to look at the


[00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:15,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m07s)

order here so backers on open collective


[00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:18,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m10s)

above the build stuff sure I might move


[00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m15s)

that down later we'll see how it looks


[00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m18s)

let's see contributors so anybody who's


[00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:29,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m21s)

contributed the project and then this


[00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:35,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m23s)

backers here to do great and then the


[00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:39,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m29s)

sponsors this actually showing like it's


[00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:43,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m35s)

commented out I can't tell if that's


[00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:47,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m39s)

just well you know what we're gonna do


[00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:52,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m43s)

this is just a readme change so I'm


[00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m47s)

going to accept it


[00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:04,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m52s)

let's see monkey with a cupcake love the


[00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:07,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h07m56s)

name Jess and we're just going to merge


[00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m04s)

this in and then we'll just test it live


[00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m07s)

and see how it goes because it is only a


[00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m09s)

readme change so it's not like anything


[00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:18,039](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m12s)

it's not like it's gonna change anything


[00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m14s)

too badly and then I'm gonna officially


[00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m18s)

put it in the to 600 milestone only


[00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m20s)

because of the timing of this it really


[00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m22s)

again it's just a readme change it's not


[00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:31,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m23s)

actually gonna affect the library in any


[00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,969](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m25s)

way so let's go down here and take a


[00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,939](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m31s)

look and see


[00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:37,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m31s)

you what this guy is done so shows


[00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:40,459](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m34s)

backers and sponsors here I'm curious


[00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,519](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m37s)

what the difference between these two or


[00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:45,949](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m40s)

these two links take us so this is just


[00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,009](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m43s)

oh they're both redirecting just down to


[00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:51,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m45s)

the lower sections so we may end up just


[00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m49s)

chewing away at some of this so let's


[00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m51s)

take a look


[00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m51s)

so screenshots all that stuff great


[00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:03,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m55s)

great great lots of screenshots you've


[00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h08m59s)

gone so contributors so if you see your


[00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m03s)

picture in here a huge thank you


[00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m05s)

everyone who contributes either pull


[00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m08s)

requests or even just feedback I know


[00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m12s)

there's several people who have gone out


[00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m14s)

of the way to test some of the new beta


[00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m15s)

builds and I definitely appreciate that


[00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:27,019](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m20s)

look there's me and then backers if


[00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m24s)

anybody wants to actually support by all


[00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m27s)

means become a sponsor what is the


[00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:37,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m29s)

difference between these two links I am


[00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:39,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m31s)

NOT just look at these guys because that


[00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,519](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m37s)

what is the difference because I don't


[00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m39s)

know if we've really set up anything


[00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,899](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m40s)

beyond just backers and so I'm wondering


[00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,189](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m43s)

if this sponsor link is kind of wasteful


[00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,399](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m46s)

we might just trim that down a little


[00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,399](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m49s)

bit


[00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h09m54s)

so okay


[00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m04s)

yeah I'm thinking it's probably not


[00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:15,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m06s)

worth having both of these because this


[00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m12s)

library really does have a pretty pretty


[00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m15s)

small budget that it operates on I mean


[00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m19s)

they're there we've only have a couple


[00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m20s)

things that actually chew up expenses


[00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m23s)

like the website and various things of


[00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m26s)

that nature but I think what we might do


[00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m28s)

is we might just whack this sponsor bit


[00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:43,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m30s)

until until such a time as we actually


[00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:48,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m34s)

need it yeah I should leave it leave it


[00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m43s)

now we'll leave it not hurting me and


[00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m48s)

doesn't bother me if if somebody


[00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m50s)

actually wants to go to that level and


[00:10:52,490 --> 00:11:01,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m52s)

do some sponsoring of it great


[00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h10m56s)

let's dive in over here I see what's


[00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m01s)

left in getting this to 600 release


[00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m02s)

because we do have a lot of stuff that's


[00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:13,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m04s)

out here this bug came in earlier today


[00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m08s)

that might be worth looking at oh I will


[00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:21,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m13s)

have to go and download some stuff to be


[00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m15s)

able to do it I don't currently have the


[00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m21s)

the dot memory installed on this machine


[00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m23s)

so might come back to this this might be


[00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m26s)

a later bit but it looks like there's


[00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m28s)

probably a memory leak it's a little


[00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m32s)

hard to tell straight from this screen


[00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:40,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m34s)

shot only because this this pulls into


[00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:47,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m38s)

the visual state manager so hang like


[00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:50,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m40s)

that bigger which this says to me that


[00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m47s)

we we probably have some issues with


[00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m50s)

when these controls are in a virtualized


[00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m53s)

manner where they're being held on to


[00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:03,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m55s)

longer than they should be


[00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h11m57s)

so we'll it seems according to Stephen


[00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m03s)

it it happen it's just in the demo app


[00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m04s)

so it should be fairly easy to reproduce


[00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m07s)

I imagine so but if somebody wants to


[00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m09s)

grab that if you're good with chasing


[00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,759](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m12s)

down memory leaks there's a couple


[00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,739](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m14s)

statics in each of those classes


[00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,759](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m17s)

that I suspect what's happening is the


[00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:26,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m19s)

instances being held on to in one of


[00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m23s)

those static collections and not being


[00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,819](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m26s)

released so I am suspecting that that is


[00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:40,609](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m29s)

the cause and just needs to get done so


[00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:43,799](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m32s)

let's see so ripple effect is not


[00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:49,759](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m40s)

centered for right-to-left direction so


[00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:52,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m43s)

this looks like a fix for that let's go


[00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m49s)

yeah let's kind of just go top to bottom


[00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,739](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m52s)

because this looks like a good pull


[00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,389](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m54s)

requested to jump in because I'm


[00:12:55,739 --> 00:13:10,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m55s)

guessing this is the bug and then the


[00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:14,419](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h12m57s)

fix for it so yep there's the fix so


[00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,419](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m10s)

let's see so there's a comment here and


[00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:21,809](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m16s)

we'll have to look a little bit in more


[00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:25,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m19s)

detail it also looks like there's


[00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:29,369](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m21s)

probably been a conflict with this given


[00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:33,299](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m25s)

the recent changes to the buttons layout


[00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:36,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m29s)

just seen this so let's take a look at


[00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:39,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m33s)

the actual change in here so


[00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:43,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m36s)

intentionally sets left to right on flow


[00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:48,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m39s)

direction which I assume is ripple


[00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:51,029](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m43s)

effect not centered okay I'll have to


[00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,119](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m48s)

look at that pop-up box and see what's


[00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m51s)

going on whitespace change white space


[00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:59,399](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m54s)

with change white space change


[00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m56s)

formatting change great this actually


[00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,039](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h13m59s)

matches and cleans up trailing


[00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:09,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m01s)

whitespace there and then this looks to


[00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,959](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m05s)

be the actual fix so check the flow


[00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:18,959](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m09s)

direction then if it's right to left


[00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:23,129](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m11s)

see ripple X and so the difference


[00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:27,529](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m18s)

between whether you go from left or


[00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,529](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m23s)

right so the plus or the minus in there


[00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:38,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m27s)

looks like it is probably


[00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:39,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m31s)

right on point and so this oh this is


[00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m38s)

good


[00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m39s)

so pulls the point get position down


[00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m42s)

inside of here so that we only do it if


[00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m45s)

we aren't trying to center because if we


[00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:56,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m47s)

are trying to center it that call is


[00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:59,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m49s)

wasted perfect so let's pull it down and


[00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:03,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m56s)

check it out so pull request


[00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:06,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h14m59s)

11:46 so we'll jump over here and come


[00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:10,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m03s)

down here to pull request


[00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:15,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m06s)

11:46 and we will just check this out


[00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m10s)

please fetch that for me


[00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:31,759](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m24s)

awesome so back here and let's take a


[00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,579](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m31s)

look


[00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,359](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m31s)

so yes Visual Studio go reload the


[00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,359](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h15m34s)

universe for me


[00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:13,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m03s)

okay so that guy's pulled up so let's


[00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:15,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m08s)

also take a quick look here then at the


[00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m13s)

bug that this is designed to fix and


[00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m15s)

make sure that we actually look at that


[00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m17s)

specific case and this is something


[00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m21s)

that's worth pointed out I like I see a


[00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m22s)

lot of comments about this online on


[00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m24s)

Twitter about open source and I I will


[00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m28s)

agree with many open-source maintainer


[00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m29s)

there's no such thing as a quick and


[00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:38,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m31s)

simple fix


[00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:40,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m33s)

I mean it's hopefully at this point it's


[00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m38s)

obvious that even a small fix I do try


[00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m40s)

to check out people's pull requests I do


[00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m42s)

try to walk through them before just


[00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m45s)

merging them in because once it merges


[00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m48s)

into the library it's now my


[00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m49s)

responsibility to maintain it and so I


[00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m52s)

want to make sure that everything that


[00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:03,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m53s)

flows in is of good quality and


[00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:11,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h16m57s)

something that I can maintain so let's


[00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:11,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m03s)

see this information this guy here and


[00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:25,449](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m14s)

then this guy here tagged it up okay so


[00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:31,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m19s)

this is apparently a nice easy view of


[00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:34,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m25s)

it and let's just take a look at this so


[00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m31s)

in this case


[00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:42,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m37s)

I don't know if it's hard to see for you


[00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:46,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m38s)

guys but on the top one the ripple


[00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m42s)

effect the kind of circle pulsing out is


[00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m46s)

occurring centered whereas on the bottom


[00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:55,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m48s)

one it is clearly way off to the left


[00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m51s)

which let's see top one is going to be


[00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m55s)

left to right depending on current


[00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m57s)

culture and the bottom one is hard-coded


[00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h17m59s)

to right-to-left so so left to right


[00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m04s)

probably and then guaranteed right to


[00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:13,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m07s)

left okay so that you may just want to


[00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,169](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m12s)

test with this little bit of code just


[00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,559](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m13s)

to make sure we get something that's


[00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:23,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m16s)

working okay so let's go in here and


[00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m20s)

let's just dump this little bit in so


[00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m23s)

stackpanel


[00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:36,669](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m24s)

bla bla bla bla so we'll just go over to


[00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:42,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m28s)

main page let's see main window home


[00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:46,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m36s)

view so scroll here or scroll your


[00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:52,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m42s)

scroll view or all this all this lots of


[00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:56,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m46s)

stuff lots of stuff oh this is a nice


[00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,059](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m52s)

bug for anybody who wants to go through


[00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m56s)

and fix it this is clearly still pointed


[00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h18m58s)

to the old pledgie donation system that


[00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m00s)

used to be in there we've updated the


[00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:09,789](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m02s)

project but it still needs to be updated


[00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:15,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m05s)

in the demo app probably a nice one if


[00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:17,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m09s)

anybody wants to take a look at that


[00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,669](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m15s)

well I'm in here I can't help but fix


[00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,289](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m17s)

the spelling errors okay


[00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:25,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m20s)

yep another reference so if you want to


[00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m23s)

hunt it just do a search for pledgee and


[00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:33,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m25s)

get all of that switch it over to open


[00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:36,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m27s)

Collective links in the readme where was


[00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,809](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m33s)

I going so let's do this one's gonna be


[00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m36s)

too difficult for me to find a good


[00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:47,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m37s)

insertion point I'll just go in here and


[00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:49,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m40s)

I will happily whack all of you guys in


[00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:54,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m47s)

exchange for that demo a little bit


[00:19:49,990 --> 00:20:00,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m49s)

I was in there before so let's see


[00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:07,029](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h19m54s)

update all of the imports update the


[00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:13,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m00s)

imports take the import and update the


[00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:17,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m07s)

import thank you resharper ok and save


[00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m13s)

and let's make sure it works


[00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m32s)

hopefully this so now that we do have


[00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m37s)

the the fix brought in we know that the


[00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m39s)

at least the attached gift that was on


[00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m41s)

the issue this is the code that was


[00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m43s)

failing but we should be able to see it


[00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m45s)

now succeed and if this works we will


[00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m49s)

just undo our changes to the demo app


[00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:02,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m52s)

will fix the merge conflicts and get


[00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:08,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h20m54s)

this guy merged in Hackett reference Oh


[00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:10,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m02s)

so the there is a unfortunate issue with


[00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m08s)

some of the way that this library works


[00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:16,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m10s)

so rather than using the normal nougat


[00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m12s)

stuff it uses a packet to pull down all


[00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m16s)

of its dependencies which is great


[00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m18s)

because packet works around a lot of the


[00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m20s)

the problems that used to exist in


[00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m22s)

nougat the newer nougat stuff is a lot


[00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m25s)

better but packet also has the ability


[00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m27s)

to pull in like just external c-sharp


[00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m30s)

files and reference them and do all


[00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m32s)

kinds of other fancy stuff so when it's


[00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m37s)

normally not a problem for for most


[00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:44,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m38s)

people but when toggling branches if you


[00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:48,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m42s)

toggle across something where there's


[00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:51,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m44s)

been a dependency chain or dependency


[00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m48s)

change it's very easy for packet to get


[00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m51s)

confused or even if it's there's just


[00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m53s)

the CS progeny I've seen it happen where


[00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m57s)

packet gets very confused and is unable


[00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h21m59s)

to run the simple solution is just close


[00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m02s)

Visual Studio and restart the long


[00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m04s)

explanation is Visual Studio keeps


[00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m07s)

msbuild processes running in the


[00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m10s)

background for performance reasons it's


[00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m12s)

a lot quicker to just use an existing


[00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m13s)

running process then start a new one


[00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:22,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m16s)

every time and so unfortunately those


[00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m19s)

msbuild processes occasionally can hold


[00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:28,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m22s)

on to references specifically build


[00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m25s)

tasks if anyone's built a custom MS


[00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m28s)

build tasks and so that can that can


[00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m30s)

bite you every so often it also


[00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m31s)

occasionally bites this project a little


[00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m34s)

bit because there's another library we


[00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m36s)

use that I wrote called show me the


[00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m38s)

zamel which is what's giving us the


[00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m40s)

those nice little buttons to be able to


[00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:49,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m43s)

show the corresponding zamel


[00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m46s)

for each of our controls so you'll see


[00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m49s)

that scattered through this zamel


[00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m51s)

display control scattered throughout it


[00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m54s)

works with an msbuild task and so it can


[00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m56s)

run into the same same type of problem


[00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h22m59s)

so if you ever run into those issues the


[00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m02s)

simplest thing is just close Visual


[00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m03s)

Studio and restart to make sure all your


[00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m05s)

MS build processes die and are forced to


[00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m08s)

reload everything and then usually


[00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:15,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m10s)

you're golden


[00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:18,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m10s)

so it's a little unfortunate but okay so


[00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m15s)

ripple is centered there ripple is


[00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m18s)

centered there I like it I like it I


[00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:28,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m21s)

like it I like it


[00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:32,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m22s)

okay so let's fix let's first undo let's


[00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m28s)

go back here real quick so crack and


[00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m32s)

we'll probably freak out for a minute


[00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m33s)

while it realizes I've got a bunch of


[00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m36s)

changes so I believe this is the paste


[00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m39s)

it in code for us


[00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m43s)

come on get crackin


[00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m45s)

I know you can do it you can do it so


[00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m47s)

I'm pretty sure we just want to throw


[00:23:49,260 --> 00:24:02,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m49s)

away yeah you just want to throw away


[00:23:51,780 --> 00:24:08,519](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h23m51s)

all the changes here and sure


[00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:11,499](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m02s)

spelling fix what keeps that stage all


[00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,289](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m08s)

and then I think what we're gonna do is


[00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:18,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m11s)

just rebase this guy on top of master


[00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:22,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m14s)

and then away we go so for those people


[00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:25,779](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m18s)

unfamiliar with git or github and how to


[00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m22s)

go through and resolve things the the


[00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:31,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m25s)

command we're going to use here so I


[00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,499](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m28s)

mean let me follow this big long line


[00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:36,509](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m31s)

back to where this commit was done


[00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:42,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m32s)

because get cracking shows this stuff in


[00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:44,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m36s)

chronological order so way back here


[00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m42s)

I assume this probably leads to from


[00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m44s)

master the work was done


[00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,249](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m47s)

the ripple effect change was done so


[00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m49s)

this is the fix for the ripple effect


[00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m51s)

and I'm guessing master was merged back


[00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m52s)

in at that point to make sure that all


[00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m54s)

the latest changes were on this branch


[00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,879](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m56s)

but then this thing is sat for a while


[00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h24m58s)

and you know you can see all of these


[00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:05,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m00s)

dots are other changes that have come in


[00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m03s)

and changed all the way all the way up


[00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m05s)

leading us to here so what we want to do


[00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:14,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m08s)

is we want to take this branch and


[00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:17,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m10s)

change the the base commit so you can


[00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m14s)

think of the base commit and get as the


[00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:21,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m17s)

commit where this thing came from so for


[00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m19s)

example the base of this commit is this


[00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m21s)

guy here the base of this one is this


[00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:31,029](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m24s)

guy here so if we rebase this branch


[00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:34,659](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m26s)

what it's going to do excuse me is it


[00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:40,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m31s)

will walk back through our git history


[00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:42,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m34s)

and replay these commits on top of the


[00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,309](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m40s)

branch that we wanted to effectively


[00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,279](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m42s)

pretend like these commit these changes


[00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m45s)

are being made from the latest position


[00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:54,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m48s)

of where the master branch is said so


[00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:57,789](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m50s)

that is what we are going to do so let's


[00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m54s)

first of all start by we're gonna pull


[00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m57s)

down because you'll notice my master


[00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,119](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h25m59s)

branch and the one on github were


[00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m02s)

different so we're going to pull up mine


[00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m04s)

just to make sure that those are in sync


[00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,379](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m05s)

and then we will right click on our


[00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:14,679](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m08s)

master branch and rebase this branch on


[00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:16,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m11s)

to master so it'll run through and I


[00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:21,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m14s)

fully expect it


[00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:25,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m16s)

show merge conflicts okay merge


[00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:31,929](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m21s)

conflicts so with the the buttons change


[00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:34,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m25s)

here so we have the change that exists


[00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:36,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m31s)

on master and the change that exists


[00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:43,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m34s)

here and I think what we're probably


[00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:45,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m36s)

going to do is take master wholesale at


[00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m43s)

least for this file because this isn't


[00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m45s)

related to the fix and the change that


[00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:55,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m48s)

was done to the buttons stuff was not


[00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m51s)

related to this so we'll hit save on the


[00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m55s)

file there and then we will effectively


[00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h26m58s)

skip that commit and keep going forward


[00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m00s)

because we took all of the changes from


[00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:09,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m02s)

master there was effectively no commit


[00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:17,679](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m04s)

for it to do let's see here


[00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:20,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m09s)

material design theme so what does this


[00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:32,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m17s)

thing what are you telling me that it


[00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:36,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m20s)

was deleted staged file this is


[00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:39,299](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m32s)

interesting I'm a little surprised at


[00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,299](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m36s)

this but


[00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:55,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m42s)

okay so you're no longer marked as


[00:27:51,720 --> 00:28:03,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m51s)

continued rebase what what are you doing


[00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:03,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h27m55s)

get crackin the base conflicts detected


[00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:21,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m13s)

some of this guy backwards for a minute


[00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:25,420](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m15s)

and let's see what's going on here so


[00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:32,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m21s)

once again take master wholesale on the


[00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:34,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m25s)

buttons and for the ripple there we go


[00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m32s)

this is where we want to be a little


[00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:41,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m34s)

more careful okay so we do want this


[00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m37s)

change because it moved the this call


[00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m41s)

down here so that one above is no longer


[00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m43s)

an issue guessing that must have been


[00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m46s)

just a whitespace change conflict one of


[00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m49s)

two and we'll go ahead and take the


[00:28:52,180 --> 00:29:05,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m52s)

white space clean up here as well pick


[00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:11,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h28m56s)

those both up and then why I'm missing


[00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:14,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m05s)

something obvious there's all files this


[00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:21,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m11s)

should I don't understand why it's


[00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:25,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m14s)

blocking my rebase so well that official


[00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:29,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m21s)

studio reload all and then I might I


[00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:31,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m25s)

just go through and I might have to kick


[00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m29s)

this rebase forward I have noticed this


[00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:37,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m31s)

issue get crackin occasionally gets


[00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m33s)

itself into these states where it's


[00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:43,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m37s)

almost like there's nothing to do and


[00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:45,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m40s)

it's not always obvious what the correct


[00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m43s)

incantation is to get it to move forward


[00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m45s)

so usually my solution is just bouncing


[00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m48s)

to another tool in this case we'll just


[00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:57,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m51s)

see if Visual Studio allows it because I


[00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:00,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m54s)

I am NOT very good with get on the


[00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h29m57s)

command line which will be my my


[00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m00s)

fallback plan because effectively we can


[00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m02s)

go through and tell it that this has


[00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m05s)

been resolved because all of our


[00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:16,420](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m07s)

conflicts are done I'm missing something


[00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:20,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m10s)

obvious get crackin this just feels why


[00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:24,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m16s)

why can we know go forward just want to


[00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:29,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m20s)

go forward continue with the commits


[00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:31,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m24s)

I think it's changes yeah re based in


[00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m29s)

progress I want to click the continue


[00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m31s)

button please


[00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:47,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m37s)

so hopefully that guy gets that there we


[00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m43s)

go it looks like we're making progress


[00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:56,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m50s)

looks like that worked and now we


[00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:59,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m53s)

effectively have both the original


[00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m56s)

commit for the change on the ripple and


[00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h30m59s)

because we took the wholesale changes


[00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:09,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m00s)

for button dot sam'l and then a minor


[00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:15,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m03s)

spelling fix which which works so then


[00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:20,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m09s)

we can go ahead and push this back out


[00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m15s)

and we will force push because we've


[00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:29,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m20s)

effectively rewritten all of the history


[00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:31,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m22s)

for the for the get stack it is it does


[00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m29s)

require either a dash F at the command


[00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m31s)

line or on get crack and clicking the


[00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m33s)

big red scary button that says no I


[00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m35s)

actually know what I'm doing so we'll


[00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m38s)

just jump back over here real quick and


[00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m41s)

I just want to do a quick build to make


[00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m43s)

sure we're still in a building state


[00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m45s)

usually that's the the biggest thing is


[00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m47s)

on these rebase is if you mess up a


[00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m50s)

merge or sometimes things will auto


[00:31:53,560 --> 00:32:00,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m53s)

merge you can get code that isn't quite


[00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h31m55s)

lined up but go back and look at our


[00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:07,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m00s)

pull request and I suspect now it'll be


[00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:11,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m02s)

in a much happier State this guy comes


[00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:14,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m07s)

down here we've got a build running the


[00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m11s)

conflicts are now gone which is great


[00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m14s)

and we'll let that guy finish real quick


[00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:23,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m16s)

and then hopefully knock two more items


[00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:26,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m20s)

off of this to 600 release because we're


[00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:30,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m23s)

getting very close for this thinking


[00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:32,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m26s)

this is probably don't hold me to this


[00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m30s)

probably in the next few weeks we'll get


[00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m32s)

this guy out the door it'll depend I


[00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m34s)

might have some more free time coming up


[00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m35s)

in the next week or so


[00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,299](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m36s)

so if I get


[00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:42,549](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m38s)

your time I will either livestream or I


[00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:45,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m40s)

might just tackle this we'll see how


[00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:48,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m42s)

many how many questions and whatnot that


[00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:59,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m45s)

come in and distract me so let's get


[00:32:48,520 --> 00:33:03,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m48s)

this guy going and we will see so it is


[00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:06,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h32m59s)

worth noting that we are using the Azure


[00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:08,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m03s)

pipelines just for the pull request


[00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:12,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m06s)

verification the actual builds are still


[00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:16,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m08s)

being done with at their at some point I


[00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:19,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m12s)

do intend to switch over all of them oh


[00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m16s)

this is just the one commit I wanted to


[00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:28,809](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m19s)

jump and look at the pipeline Oh view


[00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m26s)

more details so the big big link that


[00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:37,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m28s)

says click here to see what you want to


[00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:43,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m30s)

see because the builds are pretty fast


[00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:46,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m37s)

so compilation succeeded and then runs


[00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:51,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m43s)

all of our unit tests which there aren't


[00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:53,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m46s)

a ton largely due to the fact that in a


[00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m51s)

theming library there's some stuff that


[00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m53s)

just doesn't lend itself well to unit


[00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m55s)

testing I mean it's really hard to unit


[00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:03,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m57s)

tests to make sure that the control


[00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h33m59s)

looks the way you expect so however we


[00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m03s)

do have enough custom controls and logic


[00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:10,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m05s)

that I've started putting in unit tests


[00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m08s)

for those things just to make sure that


[00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:15,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m10s)

we don't accidentally regress some bug


[00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:21,119](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m12s)

fixes so yay


[00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:26,409](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m15s)

everything passes so good enough for me


[00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m21s)

we'll come back over here I'm not gonna


[00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:32,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m26s)

necessarily wait for it to finish


[00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m27s)

uploading its artifacts we will


[00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:50,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m40s)

go ahead and comment and then go ahead


[00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:56,409](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m46s)

and get that merged I confirm squash


[00:34:50,889 --> 00:35:00,369](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m50s)

emerge cool so that because so on github


[00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:02,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h34m56s)

if in your description you type fixes or


[00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:06,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m00s)

I think resolves there's a couple things


[00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:10,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m02s)

and then pound in the issue number it


[00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:13,109](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m06s)

should when the poll request is merged


[00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m10s)

in it should then automatically go and


[00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:20,849](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m13s)

close the issue which it has done


[00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m16s)

perfect that's exactly what we wanted


[00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:26,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m20s)

excellent excellent excellent so we are


[00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:31,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m23s)

going to switch back over here and we


[00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:35,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m26s)

should be behind master on a commit so


[00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:41,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m31s)

let's pull up master and then we will


[00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:44,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m35s)

switch back over there much come on


[00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m41s)

there it is so these two changes got


[00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:49,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m44s)

squashed merged over so we pulled master


[00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:53,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m48s)

successfully we'll switch back over to


[00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:58,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m49s)

master so we have all the latest stuffs


[00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m53s)

then we will I no longer need this


[00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h35m58s)

branch so that can go away at some point


[00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m00s)

I think I need to clean up these


[00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m02s)

branches I've lost track of what most of


[00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:10,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m04s)

them go to and probably don't need to be


[00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:17,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m08s)

interested in holding on to those any


[00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m10s)

longer okay let's come back here cleans


[00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m17s)

that up


[00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:31,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m17s)

it's that up let's go back to our


[00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:35,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m20s)

milestone refresh that guy and ah okay


[00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,609](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m31s)

so this one here this is more just


[00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:43,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m35s)

needing to go through and do this so


[00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:43,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m38s)

request outline button style


[00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:52,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m44s)

so you think this one's been this is a


[00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:57,569](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m49s)

request is this the this is a fix for


[00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,569](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m52s)

that one let's just say fix 10 27 I


[00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:05,849](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h36m57s)

think this is probably just an issue


[00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:05,849](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m01s)

here to pull in and then


[00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:25,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m12s)

yeah so this reference is here that guy


[00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:27,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m18s)

there and then that one there so this


[00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m25s)

guy here and we may take a closer look


[00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:35,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m27s)

at the corner radius current corner


[00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:38,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m31s)

radius is small apparently supposed to


[00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:47,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m35s)

be more like three or four pixels so


[00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:49,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m38s)

we'll take a look at this guy and so


[00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:58,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m47s)

let's take a look at this


[00:37:49,830 --> 00:38:03,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m49s)

so outline button outline button order


[00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:05,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h37m58s)

thickness one yeah so this guy has a


[00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m03s)

corner radius of two the other thing is


[00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:12,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m05s)

we now have in the latest code an


[00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:15,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m09s)

attached property for corner radius so


[00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:20,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m12s)

we might want to change this up a little


[00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:24,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m15s)

bit so let's go ahead and do this one


[00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:28,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m20s)

next since I've got two of these items


[00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:31,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m24s)

in here we'll get this guy in and merged


[00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:42,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m28s)

so let's see 12:48 so the new magical


[00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:48,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m31s)

number let's come down here 12:48 yes


[00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:52,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m42s)

please check it out oh and I need to do


[00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:55,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m48s)

branch names so let's call this outline


[00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h38m52s)

button style


[00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:09,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m02s)

just so we can differentiate it from my


[00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:13,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m04s)

master for those of you submitting pull


[00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:15,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m09s)

requests it is mildly easier if you pull


[00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m13s)

requests from a branch that isn't your


[00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:24,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m15s)

master it doesn't really bother me that


[00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:28,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m18s)

much but it doesn't make it mildly more


[00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:34,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m24s)

convenient what did you do


[00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:36,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m28s)

so discard all changes don't know


[00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:38,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m34s)

occasionally when it does the the


[00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m36s)

checkout on this it gets very very


[00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:47,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m38s)

confused let's just clap collapse my


[00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:49,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m41s)

remotes so get all of this all of those


[00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:54,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m47s)

changes done and then just switch


[00:39:49,250 --> 00:40:00,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m49s)

branches that's all I want because it


[00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:02,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h39m54s)

cannot access that sounds like yeah


[00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m00s)

we're gonna run into that same packet


[00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:10,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m02s)

issue that is one of the annoying things


[00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:16,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m04s)

about working on branches is that they


[00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:18,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m10s)

do tend to get and this weird weird


[00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:22,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m16s)

state with those long-running msbuild


[00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:27,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m18s)

processes tempted to just straight-up


[00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:29,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m22s)

rebase this guy now let's look at it


[00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:33,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m27s)

first because I want to look at how that


[00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:36,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m29s)

outline was done on the demo page the


[00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m33s)

nice part is this is just one individual


[00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m36s)

commitment so it'll be pretty easy to go


[00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m38s)

through and get stuff brought in just


[00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h40m41s)

bring that guy across


[00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:15,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m09s)

come on this yesterday you can do it you


[00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:17,579](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m11s)

can do it I will say the the the


[00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,729](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m15s)

performance improvements in Visual


[00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,259](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m17s)

Studio 2019 are very nice there are


[00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:24,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m20s)

there are other issues with it but I


[00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:27,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m22s)

have noticed that at least the speed of


[00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:33,539](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m24s)

loading the the projects and solutions


[00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:35,489](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m27s)

is noticeably faster than in 2017 so at


[00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,559](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m33s)

least for this process of when you have


[00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:40,469](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m35s)

to kill and relaunch it goes a lot


[00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:44,159](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m37s)

quicker let's make sure so we are down


[00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:52,319](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m40s)

on this branch so let's fire this guy up


[00:41:44,159 --> 00:42:00,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m44s)

and take a look at it it looks like it


[00:41:52,319 --> 00:42:03,299](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h41m52s)

should be pretty simple one enable and


[00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,219](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m00s)

one disabled next to the flat ones okay


[00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:07,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m03s)

so this this is actually good and thank


[00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:10,589](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m05s)

you for this comment Albert if you're


[00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:12,089](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m07s)

watching this even just little


[00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,769](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m10s)

descriptions like this so that I don't


[00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,829](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m12s)

have to go and track down where things


[00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:19,349](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m13s)

are supposed to go after the merge is


[00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:26,489](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m15s)

awesome so this should make it pretty


[00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:28,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m19s)

easy we will get this guy recompiled the


[00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:30,239](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m26s)

other drawback is whenever you switch


[00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,689](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m28s)

branches especially going back in


[00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:37,589](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m30s)

history this far it almost always has to


[00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:44,009](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m33s)

do a full recompile because everything


[00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:48,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m37s)

is different which is fine we'll work


[00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:48,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m44s)

through it we will work through it


[00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:04,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h42m58s)

and for all of you who have been jumping


[00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m02s)

in and even just helping people out with


[00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m04s)

questions on the getter channel I do


[00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m07s)

appreciate that too I try to make sure


[00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m10s)

that I get in and make sure that


[00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:18,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m11s)

everyone has an answer so don't feel bad


[00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m15s)

if I I come in and throw an answer after


[00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m18s)

you it just means that I felt like there


[00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m20s)

was something to add but a lot of times


[00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m22s)

when I'm seeing people answer questions


[00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:30,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m24s)

they're pretty it's really good stuff in


[00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m27s)

there so I encourage people to ask


[00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m30s)

questions and more importantly if you


[00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m32s)

see a question that you know the answer


[00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:39,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m33s)

to feel free to chime in and help out


[00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m36s)

and and don't worry about being wrong or


[00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m39s)

whatever we all make mistakes even I


[00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m42s)

screw up when I'm typing code in there


[00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:52,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m44s)

sometime so let's see what do we lose


[00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m48s)

squawking about what was the air oh


[00:43:52,700 --> 00:44:03,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m52s)

that's great well with the air access to


[00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:09,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h43m57s)

path is denied didn't we just go through


[00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:10,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m03s)

this so we're gonna just try one more


[00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:14,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m09s)

time


[00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:16,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m10s)

I may not have given it enough time to


[00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m14s)

kill the msbuild processes it's worth


[00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m16s)

knowing that if you have multiple


[00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m18s)

instances of Visual Studio open you yeah


[00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:31,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m20s)

it's gonna squawk dang NAB it well let's


[00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:36,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m24s)

see if we can just do this this way this


[00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:38,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m31s)

guy over and I'm just gonna hunt down


[00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:42,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m36s)

these msbuild processes I think if I do


[00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m38s)

this this and just whack them here so


[00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:48,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m42s)

we'll also do the same thing of forcing


[00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:51,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m44s)

it to recent launch them see if that


[00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m48s)

works I think that's the same I don't


[00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:58,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m51s)

know for a fact so don't quote me on


[00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:01,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m54s)

that I do know that the issue is msbuild


[00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:06,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h44m58s)

holding file handles open but I'm not


[00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:11,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m01s)

entirely clear if that's the symptom or


[00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:12,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m06s)

the the root cause so regardless killing


[00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m11s)

Visual Studio


[00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m12s)

launching will force those processes to


[00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m14s)

restart as uh looks like we are in


[00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:23,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m18s)

business


[00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:25,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m19s)

debug output we are launching excellent


[00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m23s)

excellent excellent and at some point


[00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m25s)

there are some there are some warnings


[00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:34,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m28s)

and just error output I've been ignoring


[00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:37,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m31s)

it but if anybody wanted to go through


[00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:41,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m34s)

and fix that I would be very grateful ok


[00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:47,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m37s)

button Styles not to get too far off


[00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:57,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m41s)

track so these guys here I think it's


[00:45:47,280 --> 00:46:05,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m47s)

Windows grab magnifier and let's just


[00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:08,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h45m57s)

zoom in on this guy a little bit so I


[00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m05s)

think


[00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:25,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m10s)

yeah I see the I do see that rounding


[00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:27,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m19s)

yeah we probably want to too much of


[00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:31,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m25s)

them too much soon we probably do want


[00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:34,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m27s)

to change up that corner radius a little


[00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m31s)

bit or at least change it to use the


[00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:43,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m34s)

attached property so that other people


[00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:46,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m35s)

can modify it so let's go back and go


[00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:49,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m43s)

and have more fun with our good buddy


[00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:52,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m46s)

rebase so because master is in sync


[00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:59,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m49s)

already we can just jump straight to


[00:46:52,130 --> 00:47:05,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m52s)

rebase and once again merge conflicts so


[00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:09,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h46m59s)

uh let's see here what do we got this is


[00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m05s)

where it might get a little interesting


[00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,560](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m11s)

eirick resource


[00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m18s)

actually I think what I'm gonna do real


[00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:31,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m20s)

quick for tree base I think what I'm


[00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:34,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m24s)

gonna do is just cheat and reload all I


[00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:37,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m31s)

think I'm just gonna copy out and maybe


[00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m34s)

I can grab it right off of this files


[00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:45,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m37s)

changed I think I'm just gonna grab the


[00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:51,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m39s)

change that was done buttons outlined


[00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:54,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m45s)

buttons outline - I think I'm just gonna


[00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:58,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m51s)

grab this and then I'll just take


[00:47:54,990 --> 00:48:00,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m54s)

Master's change for everything having to


[00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:04,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h47m58s)

do with the the demo file and then we'll


[00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:07,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m00s)

just go and find the flat buttons and


[00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:11,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m04s)

bring this code in next to it since I


[00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:14,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m07s)

know we did a redesign of that page so


[00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:16,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m11s)

come back over here re kick off that


[00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m14s)

rebase so I think that'll make it a


[00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m16s)

little bit a little bit easier rather


[00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m20s)

than trying to to merge these things


[00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m22s)

together because I think the merge is


[00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m24s)

just gonna cause the zamel to go all


[00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:34,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m27s)

crazy on me


[00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:42,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m29s)

so I think what we'll do is we'll just


[00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:49,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m34s)

so we'll take master wholesale take that


[00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:52,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m42s)

can you rebase that should be it okay so


[00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m49s)

what does it now show the change so it's


[00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m52s)

worth noting you can always do these


[00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m54s)

rebase --is and then deal with the


[00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:02,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h48m56s)

fallout and check to make sure it's


[00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m00s)

right as long as you don't push you can


[00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:08,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m02s)

always throw away your local branch and


[00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:13,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m04s)

start over again so well looks like


[00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m08s)

looks like we may be in business cool


[00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m13s)

cool


[00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m15s)

let's get that guy reloaded and make


[00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:26,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m18s)

sure that he still works correctly again


[00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:29,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m20s)

and then we will see about handling that


[00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m26s)

corner radius issue


[00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:42,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m33s)

and then we'll have one more style to


[00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:45,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m36s)

use it should be great at some point I


[00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m42s)

need to


[00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:52,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m45s)

there was a PowerShell script that was


[00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:55,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m48s)

written and done for generating out the


[00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:58,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m52s)

markdown for all of the styles and I


[00:49:55,270 --> 00:50:01,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m55s)

need to get that integrated into our


[00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:05,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h49m58s)

pipeline because I'd like to have the


[00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:07,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m01s)

Azure pipelines every time changes are


[00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m05s)

merged in have it automatically updated


[00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:12,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m07s)

doc out on the wiki so that people don't


[00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m09s)

necessarily have to churn through the


[00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m12s)

codebase to find what Styles exist for


[00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:19,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m14s)

which controls so there's an actual list


[00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m17s)

that's just sitting out there I think


[00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:25,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m19s)

that would make it easier for for


[00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m21s)

everybody because I don't mind when when


[00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m25s)

people ask and say hey what about this


[00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:32,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m26s)

style what about that style but it is a


[00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m28s)

little obnoxious even for myself just


[00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:36,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m32s)

trying to to use it I find myself going


[00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m34s)

back to the demo app a lot and going oh


[00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:40,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m36s)

yeah we had something that looked like


[00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m38s)

oh that and you know having to find the


[00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m40s)

style key that way which that works I


[00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m43s)

just think that it would be easier if


[00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m46s)

there was a flat list and especially if


[00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:53,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m48s)

it was something that was automatically


[00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:56,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m50s)

done when a pull request merged that


[00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m53s)

wouldn't make me even happier because


[00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:01,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m56s)

then it's not something I have to to try


[00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h50m59s)

and manage there's several things I'm


[00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:08,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m01s)

hoping to get automated as part of those


[00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:12,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m03s)

pipelines to go through and do so if


[00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m08s)

anyone is a Azure DevOps expert and


[00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:17,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m12s)

would like to help with the pipelines


[00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:19,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m13s)

please message me on getter I I would be


[00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m17s)

happy to walk through some of the


[00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m19s)

changes that I would like to get in to


[00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m21s)

the pipelines that we're using and if


[00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m23s)

you want to help out with it that would


[00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:35,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m24s)

be awesome I would happily accept help


[00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:38,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m27s)

there so that so yeah so that goes there


[00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m35s)

the only issue here is I think we're


[00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:43,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m38s)

missing an end


[00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:50,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m40s)

learn more


[00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:50,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m43s)

unless so let's just fix that real quick


[00:51:51,590 --> 00:52:06,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h51m51s)

eh so we'll just throw that on there


[00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:08,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m02s)

okay so now on this style


[00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m06s)

so you'll notice and this is actually a


[00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m08s)

perfect case for it


[00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m11s)

so you'll notice right on this example


[00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:18,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m13s)

here this is our new attached property


[00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m15s)

for the corner radius so what I think


[00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:24,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m18s)

what we're going to do so I want to jump


[00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:27,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m20s)

back to the to the comet that was made


[00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:31,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m24s)

on here I think was actually made on the


[00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:33,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m27s)

original issue and I don't know if issue


[00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m31s)

: the number will cause it to be


[00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:42,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m33s)

resolved but at least it makes for an


[00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:46,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m35s)

easy link oh I guess it's right here so


[00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m42s)

there was a comment down here about the


[00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:54,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m48s)

and the corner ones in the spec are tiny


[00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:58,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m52s)

bit more rounded however so let's go I


[00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:02,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m54s)

think we had a link to the spec didn't


[00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:04,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h52m58s)

we yeah Magnus had put that in so let's


[00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:09,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m02s)

take a look and see if they actually


[00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:12,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m04s)

define what the corner radius should be


[00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:14,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m09s)

or if it's just you should have a corner


[00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m12s)

radius and it should be something


[00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m14s)

because there are some areas of the spec


[00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m16s)

that are pretty loose and some areas


[00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:25,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m19s)

where they're very specific so our case


[00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m22s)

we're doing the outline button


[00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:37,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m28s)

what did not take me where I wanted to


[00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:37,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m33s)

go let's try that one more time


[00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m38s)

navigate me to the outline button


[00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:52,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m43s)

[Music]


[00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:52,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m44s)

States outline button okay thank you so


[00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m52s)

great this is when to use it states for


[00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m57s)

it


[00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:08,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h53m58s)

it's really defined let's go back to the


[00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:08,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m02s)

top and see if this guy has a specs


[00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:20,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m13s)

Kame button with icon contain button so


[00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:26,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m17s)

they declare a min-width


[00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:36,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m20s)

they declare sort of an internal padding


[00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:43,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m26s)

of the content of 16 and figure out what


[00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:44,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m36s)

that one is in relationship to the 16 is


[00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:53,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m43s)

clearly there


[00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:53,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m44s)

I cannot imagine doesn't really give me


[00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:05,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h54m55s)

so these ones here st. for typography


[00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:09,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m00s)

color shrine because these are different


[00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:17,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m05s)

other libraries that have implemented it


[00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:17,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m09s)

so it's just


[00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:28,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m18s)

radius yeah so they don't really care if


[00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m24s)

you have a big corner radius either


[00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:38,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m30s)

there is a good question about what


[00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:41,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m33s)

should it be so given that I think the


[00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:44,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m38s)

key thing is here we make we need to


[00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:50,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m41s)

have a reasonable default and it needs


[00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:59,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m44s)

to be over aidable with the attached


[00:55:50,770 --> 00:56:02,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m50s)

property so step one set our property C


[00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h55m59s)

WPF :


[00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:13,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m02s)

button button assist corner radius value


[00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m10s)

so two will match at least feature


[00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:20,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m13s)

parity of what we have before and then


[00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m16s)

this guy here so you'll notice for


[00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:24,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m20s)

example like this feedback guy


[00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:26,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m21s)

propagates down it's not a white space


[00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:33,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m24s)

on the end of that let's clean that up


[00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:35,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m26s)

too you know what I might do is these


[00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:38,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m33s)

are the only two properties not on their


[00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m35s)

own line just move these down I think


[00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:43,869](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m38s)

that's a little bit clearer to look at


[00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:49,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m39s)

and then you are probably gonna end up


[00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:53,859](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m43s)

the same way it's not a real fine line


[00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:57,359](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m49s)

of when to do each of these styles aside


[00:56:53,859 --> 00:57:00,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m53s)

from what do I think looks good


[00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:04,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h56m57s)

so we need to do so you can do a


[00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:08,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m00s)

template binding to an attached property


[00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m04s)

but what you can do is a relative source


[00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m08s)

binding


[00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:21,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m14s)

so a templated parent and then we come


[00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:28,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m18s)

over here and do paths and then


[00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:34,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m21s)

parentheses see WPF button assist corner


[00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m28s)

radius something like that


[00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:44,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m37s)

kill execution so that sharper can


[00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:48,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m40s)

figure itself out some things just don't


[00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:51,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m44s)

work for lives ammo edit and continue so


[00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:55,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m48s)

I do wonder what the appropriate corner


[00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:58,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m51s)

radius should be so I think in the


[00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:04,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m55s)

interest of making this similar what do


[00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:04,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h57m58s)

you use what do you use


[00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:17,309](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m10s)

yeah so this is the same thing here so


[00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:22,739](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m15s)

what is the default of this so the


[00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:29,819](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m17s)

default of this is two so even by even


[00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:36,209](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m22s)

by doing nothing we don't this setter is


[00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:38,579](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m29s)

actually kind of meaningless I kind of


[00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:43,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m36s)

like the explicit set here regardless I


[00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:44,729](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m38s)

think it it exposes I think it makes it


[00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:47,069](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m43s)

more obvious to people that they can


[00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:54,329](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m44s)

override this so I think I may just


[00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:58,349](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m47s)

leave it for now and our other buttons


[00:58:54,329 --> 00:59:01,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m54s)

are all doing two as well so I think


[00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:05,369](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h58m58s)

what I'm going to do since I don't see a


[00:59:01,439 --> 00:59:07,589](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m01s)

strong guidance in the spec about


[00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:09,929](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m05s)

exactly what the corner radius should be


[00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:12,029](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m07s)

and the interest of keeping our other


[00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:13,469](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m09s)

ones matching because I think it would


[00:59:12,029 --> 00:59:15,659](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m12s)

look a little weird if you flipped from


[00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:19,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m13s)

like the flat button to the outline


[00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:21,779](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m15s)

button I think I'm just gonna leave it


[00:59:19,439 --> 00:59:23,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m19s)

at two and if you want something


[00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:27,259](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m21s)

different in your app the attached


[00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:30,509](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m23s)

property exists and you are free to


[00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:38,609](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m27s)

modify that to whatever makes the most


[00:59:30,509 --> 00:59:43,859](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m30s)

sense so reasonable default and it can


[00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:48,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m38s)

be overridden I like it I like it let's


[00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:52,529](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m43s)

see where we're going here so see what's


[00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:56,189](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m48s)

the change here we added the end for the


[00:59:52,529 --> 01:00:00,779](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m52s)

spelling raaah and then let's take a


[00:59:56,189 --> 01:00:02,429](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=00h59m56s)

look at take a look at this guy here so


[01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:04,259](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m00s)

we added the setter for corner radius


[01:00:02,429 --> 01:00:07,289](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m02s)

even though this duplicates the default


[01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:10,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m04s)

value so not explicitly necessary we're


[01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:13,049](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m07s)

gonna leave it for now this guy then has


[01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m10s)

a corner radius here oh that's one thing


[01:00:13,049 --> 01:00:17,039](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m13s)

we should do real quick before I get


[01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,419](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m14s)

before I get too carried away let's just


[01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:23,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m17s)

go through and make sure it's always


[01:00:21,419 --> 01:00:27,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m21s)

good always good to test your


[01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:31,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m23s)

so we'll do a really big corner radius


[01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:36,539](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m27s)

just to come on copy operation should


[01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:38,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m31s)

not be difficult there you go


[01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:39,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m36s)

we'll just slap in a big number here


[01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m38s)

just to make sure that this actually


[01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:45,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m39s)

does work the way we expect and then if


[01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:48,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m43s)

we're if that gives us a nice large


[01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:50,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m45s)

rounded corner we'll merge this in and


[01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:55,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m48s)

we'll have two more items for the


[01:00:50,910 --> 01:01:00,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m50s)

release done we'll have a nice outline


[01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:00,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h00m55s)

button style to go to boot


[01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:17,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m10s)

come on you can do a visual studio I'm


[01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:21,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m14s)

guessing the OBS is probably chewing


[01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:27,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m17s)

sizeable percentage yeah it looks like


[01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:37,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m21s)

OBS and Visual Studio get to fight who


[01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:40,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m27s)

gets the most compute power great and


[01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:42,609](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m37s)

one of those binding airs I do often


[01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:45,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m40s)

wonder how much of my life is wasted


[01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:47,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m42s)

looking at that same initial binding err


[01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:49,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m45s)

at some point it will annoy me enough to


[01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:56,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m47s)

go and look at it and actually get it


[01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:58,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m49s)

fixed suppose we can go through and look


[01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:00,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m56s)

at doing this and make and just validate


[01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:02,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h01m58s)

that we didn't break anything else while


[01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:06,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m00s)

that guy's firing up so border brush is


[01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:08,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m02s)

still set border thickness still set the


[01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,420](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m06s)

same those are all just new line and


[01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:13,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m08s)

whitespace changes all the way down


[01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:18,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m10s)

through here so it really is just the


[01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:18,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m13s)

one change so this file we can stage


[01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:25,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m19s)

let's go look at it so we should see a


[01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:35,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m22s)

button with a very large corner radius


[01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:35,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m25s)

and we do great sweet I'll take it


[01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:46,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m37s)

so let's go through and we will pick


[01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:49,609](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m41s)

that up and one more change down so this


[01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:52,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m46s)

change now should just be the one end


[01:02:49,609 --> 01:03:01,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m49s)

great stage all changes


[01:02:52,690 --> 01:03:01,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h02m52s)

let's see added corner radius support


[01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:08,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m02s)

take those guys and then once again


[01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:12,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m05s)

because we rebased it we've effectively


[01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:16,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m08s)

done a rewrite of the get history we are


[01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:18,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m12s)

going to push and it's going to complain


[01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m16s)

because we've changed a whole bunch of


[01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:25,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m18s)

stuff or and say nope trust me I know


[01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:30,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m20s)

better force push that guy on up I


[01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:39,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m25s)

should be able to go back and squash


[01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:42,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m30s)

merge we'll come back over here and I'm


[01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:46,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m39s)

just gonna we won't wait for the CI to


[01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:50,450](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m42s)

kick off since we just ran it locally I


[01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:53,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m46s)

know at some point this is going to bite


[01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h03m50s)

me but


[01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:12,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m07s)

make sure we get a nice thank you


[01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:15,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m09s)

comment in there and that guy is now


[01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:21,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m12s)

merged for the two six oh release did it


[01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:25,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m15s)

auto resolve this for me did not but


[01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:28,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m21s)

like you know close this issue out two


[01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:38,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m25s)

more things off the list the list gets


[01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:42,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m28s)

shorter cruising okay so this is just a


[01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:48,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m38s)

wiki change and I don't know if this is


[01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:52,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m42s)

completely necessary or not this is a


[01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:58,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m48s)

I've left this issue and pull request


[01:04:52,060 --> 01:05:03,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m52s)

sitting open there's a nice long link


[01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:06,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h04m58s)

through it I think there's another


[01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:11,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m03s)

comment that probably should be put in


[01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:13,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m06s)

there too just for the wiki changes the


[01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:15,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m11s)

the short version is occasionally things


[01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:17,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m13s)

can get off by a pixel because of the


[01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:19,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m15s)

way WPF does layout rounding and so


[01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m17s)

especially with like dark theme it gets


[01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:24,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m19s)

more obvious so with dark theme it


[01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m22s)

usually shows up as little white lines


[01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:30,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m24s)

and light theme it shows up it's kind of


[01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m27s)

little grey lines where it's tried to


[01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m30s)

smooth over the fact that things don't


[01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:35,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m31s)

line up if you set layout rounding to


[01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m33s)

true typically at the root so this means


[01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m35s)

either at your main window or your


[01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:42,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m37s)

top-level user control or whatever is


[01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:44,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m39s)

reasonably high level that should fix


[01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m42s)

the problem because it'll force all of


[01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:50,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m44s)

the children to effectively rather than


[01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m47s)

doing fractions of a pixel actually


[01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m50s)

round it to whole pixels so things


[01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:59,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m52s)

actually line up right on the pixel


[01:05:53,530 --> 01:06:05,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m53s)

boundaries which is what you want let's


[01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:10,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h05m59s)

take a look at this this is one that we


[01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:14,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m05s)

toyed around with for a while so the


[01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:16,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m10s)

goal was to have a prettier looking


[01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:20,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m14s)

scrollbar there was a bunch of


[01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:21,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m16s)

discussion and back and forth this one


[01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:27,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m20s)

from like


[01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:30,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m21s)

Google Hangouts and I think I think


[01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:40,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m27s)

somebody this poor request actually


[01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:40,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m30s)

implements it yeah and I


[01:06:47,050 --> 01:07:04,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m47s)

so there's a bunch of changes here let's


[01:06:51,520 --> 01:07:07,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h06m51s)

see so so and then the possibility of a


[01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:10,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m04s)

toggle to put the repeat buttons back on


[01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:13,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m07s)

the only thing with that is this style


[01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:16,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m10s)

seems to largely be about removing them


[01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:20,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m13s)

and so at that point it seems more like


[01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:20,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m16s)

the request is turn this style back off


[01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:27,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m21s)

so let's let's let's take a look because


[01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:30,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m25s)

I do want to revisit this I think at a


[01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:33,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m27s)

minimum even if it's not on by default I


[01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:36,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m30s)

would like us to have a good material


[01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:41,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m33s)

design scrollbar added into the library


[01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:44,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m36s)

that can be used so boy files changed


[01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:48,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m41s)

256 this sounds like something just


[01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:51,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m44s)

needs to be rebased let's start with


[01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:55,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m48s)

that that seems like a proper way to go


[01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:57,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m51s)

so we will pull in the latest master


[01:07:55,090 --> 01:08:02,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m55s)

change from our merge or I guess our


[01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:09,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h07m57s)

squash merge and then let's switch back


[01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:11,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m02s)

to that branch and then we will get rid


[01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m09s)

of this branch just we should no longer


[01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:24,539](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m11s)

need it great


[01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:29,639](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m14s)

okay so now that that's cooking okay


[01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:35,639](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m24s)

let's what was the magic pull number 651


[01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:40,420](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m29s)

let's go and look at pull requests 651


[01:08:35,639 --> 01:08:46,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m35s)

wow it is the oldest pull request two


[01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:49,179](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m40s)

years ago oh boy that's probably only


[01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:51,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m46s)

gonna be a few changes that need to be


[01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:51,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h08m49s)

made on this one


[01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:12,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m06s)

okay so we're way back in our history


[01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:26,219](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m08s)

tree back in the the middle of nowhere


[01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:29,929](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m12s)

and so let's go back and see what it's


[01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,929](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m26s)

going to take to rebase this


[01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:42,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m34s)

oh let's see here what is this guy


[01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:45,809](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m38s)

showing me why is this that corner


[01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m42s)

radius support oh it's because I still


[01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:52,309](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m45s)

have the remote we don't need that


[01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:55,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m49s)

remote anymore we merge the pull request


[01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:58,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m52s)

so that can go away there that looks


[01:09:55,230 --> 01:10:03,449](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m55s)

that looks more like I would expect okay


[01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:10,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h09m58s)

so let's see how painful this is gonna


[01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:13,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m03s)

be this patch has already been applied


[01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:19,349](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m10s)

so that says that somebody didn't emerge


[01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:25,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m13s)

from master at some point that was way


[01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:36,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m19s)

too easy way too easy okay so let's look


[01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:36,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m25s)

at these disks so a whole lot of changes


[01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:51,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m40s)

and the same type of thing here lots of


[01:10:48,989 --> 01:10:54,809](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m48s)

clean up lots of good changes through


[01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:57,239](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m51s)

there lots of good changes through there


[01:10:54,809 --> 01:10:59,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m54s)

so this basically boils down to scroll


[01:10:57,239 --> 01:11:04,139](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m57s)

bar and scroll viewer so these are


[01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:09,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h10m59s)

effectively on by default okay so let's


[01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:11,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m04s)

go and take a look at the library now


[01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:14,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m09s)

probably just needs to reload the


[01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m11s)

universe


[01:11:38,499 --> 01:11:54,729](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m38s)

to do the to do dude okay so guys fired


[01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:58,659](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m49s)

up and just launched and see how this


[01:11:54,729 --> 01:12:01,769](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m54s)

guy see how it goes so might it might be


[01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:01,769](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h11m58s)

pretty simple


[01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:22,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m16s)

I do recall there was a lot of I'm


[01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:25,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m19s)

trying to refresh myself on exactly all


[01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:29,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m22s)

of the conversation on this because


[01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:29,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m25s)

there was there was a lot of bits


[01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:38,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m31s)

there's this corner radius part that


[01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m35s)

should be there


[01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:51,040](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m46s)

there's an example of this here


[01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h12m57s)

yeah


[01:13:10,209 --> 01:13:14,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m10s)

so that's right the minimalistic smile


[01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:24,659](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m13s)

jameelah school are on the second


[01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:27,369](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m14s)

screenshot looks really nice so


[01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:31,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m24s)

basically this so the flattened scroll


[01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:39,909](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m27s)

bar with no rounded corners kind of


[01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:44,949](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m31s)

thing I agree yeah I don't think that's


[01:13:39,909 --> 01:13:49,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m39s)

quite the way we're going let's let's


[01:13:44,949 --> 01:13:58,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m44s)

jump over here and let's go like here's


[01:13:49,300 --> 01:14:00,699](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m49s)

an example of it that doesn't look bad


[01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:08,829](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h13m58s)

let's do like buttons here and take a


[01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:12,789](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m00s)

look interesting so let's do something


[01:14:08,829 --> 01:14:15,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m08s)

like color tool and cuz I'm curious how


[01:14:12,789 --> 01:14:20,229](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m12s)

this looks if I flip it over to dark


[01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:22,059](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m15s)

let's go back to buttons it's a little


[01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:26,139](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m20s)

more prominent in the dark theme than


[01:14:22,059 --> 01:14:30,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m22s)

the light theme I'm wondering how that


[01:14:26,139 --> 01:14:34,209](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m26s)

thing is being styled but I do like that


[01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:39,579](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m30s)

look I tend to agree I believe that's


[01:14:34,209 --> 01:14:41,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m34s)

sort of where sort of where people came


[01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:45,789](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m39s)

to the same conclusion of they like the


[01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:52,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m41s)

the repeat buttons gone with some maybe


[01:14:45,789 --> 01:15:02,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m45s)

some optional bits for corner radius so


[01:14:52,320 --> 01:15:05,139](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h14m52s)

so yeah I agree with myself there and so


[01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:08,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m02s)

we've at least got one in three - seems


[01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:08,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m05s)

to be the same request


[01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:22,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m16s)

so and then then it becomes the question


[01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:24,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m20s)

here of do we do we automatically


[01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:28,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m22s)

replace them with the new minimalist


[01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:36,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m24s)

style or do we or do we force you to opt


[01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:38,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m28s)

in yeah and in this question here about


[01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:42,349](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m36s)

are we sure we want to keep the current


[01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:45,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m38s)

one as default yeah and this is one of


[01:15:42,349 --> 01:15:47,239](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m42s)

those weird areas where what what really


[01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:52,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m45s)

counts as a breaking change when we're


[01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:55,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m47s)

talking about look because what what one


[01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m52s)

person considers a breaking change to


[01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:59,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m55s)

the look of their app someone else might


[01:15:57,260 --> 01:16:03,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m57s)

see as an upgrade and be perfectly fine


[01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:05,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h15m59s)

with it because it's I think it's going


[01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:08,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m03s)

too far to say that every visual change


[01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:11,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m05s)

is a breaking change I think there is


[01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:12,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m08s)

that's that's too far to one extreme but


[01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,449](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m11s)

obviously we can't just completely


[01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:20,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m12s)

change everything without revving it and


[01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:24,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m17s)

this is a minor version rev so maybe


[01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:28,369](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m20s)

this is okay that is one of those hard


[01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:31,969](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m24s)

things that semver is nice but it


[01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:33,739](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m28s)

doesn't really define these kind of


[01:16:31,969 --> 01:16:35,139](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m31s)

halfway States oh that's what we're


[01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:42,559](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m33s)

doing


[01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:46,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m35s)

material design let's just jump there so


[01:16:42,559 --> 01:16:48,679](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m42s)

I'm curious if the specification has any


[01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,869](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m46s)

since they because I think all of this


[01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:56,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m48s)

discussion happened free material design


[01:16:50,869 --> 01:16:56,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m50s)

v2 and I'm curious if there has been any


[01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:05,929](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h16m57s)

any indication regarding scrolling is


[01:17:03,409 --> 01:17:11,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m03s)

worth noting that our implementation


[01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:14,599](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m05s)

roughly matches this scroll bar here I'm


[01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:17,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m11s)

wondering does it so light slightly


[01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:19,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m14s)

darker even darker when you clicked so


[01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:24,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m17s)

let's go back to our light theme real


[01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:26,019](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m19s)

quick toggle that oh that's something


[01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m24s)

else that I need to fix


[01:17:26,019 --> 01:17:30,219](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m26s)

because right now you can get yourself


[01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:32,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m28s)

into a broken state if you use both the


[01:17:30,219 --> 01:17:34,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m30s)

palette and the color tool to change the


[01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m32s)

state of the app and I think what I need


[01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:38,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m34s)

to do is just merge the the palette


[01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:41,289](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m36s)

functionality into the color tool and


[01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:44,199](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m38s)

then just kill this page off completely


[01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:46,719](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m41s)

because ultimately you can use the old


[01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:48,489](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m44s)

API if you want I recommend people


[01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m46s)

switch to the new API as as soon as


[01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:54,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m48s)

they're able but it's not a it's not a


[01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:57,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m51s)

breaking API change in in any regard but


[01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:59,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m54s)

be aware you cannot mix the old API s


[01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:01,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m57s)

and the new API s so if you start


[01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:04,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h17m59s)

changing colors in one part of your app


[01:18:01,989 --> 01:18:06,489](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m01s)

with the newer api's and changing it in


[01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:09,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m04s)

the older API s you can get yourself


[01:18:06,489 --> 01:18:11,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m06s)

into a broken state so either upgrade


[01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:16,139](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m09s)

all your API or don't upgrade any of


[01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:18,699](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m11s)

them but don't do it half way so lighter


[01:18:16,139 --> 01:18:23,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m16s)

so the mouse that is one thing that's


[01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:25,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m18s)

missing is the it does darken when the


[01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:28,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m23s)

mouse goes over but it doesn't go to


[01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:31,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m25s)

that darker state when you actually


[01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:35,019](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m28s)

click down the same way that this one


[01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:39,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m31s)

does and I'm sort of inclined to think


[01:18:35,019 --> 01:18:42,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m35s)

that the style of the material design


[01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:49,239](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m39s)

website is probably reasonable for what


[01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:52,420](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m42s)

is expected see looking for something to


[01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:58,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m49s)

do with scrolling I don't know if they


[01:18:52,420 --> 01:19:00,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m52s)

really handle it in a lot of cases might


[01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:06,969](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h18m58s)

take a look at what they do for lists


[01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:08,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m00s)

because lists inherently scroll down


[01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:13,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m06s)

sliders will have anything but we'll


[01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:17,309](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m08s)

we'll take a look and you know let's


[01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:20,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m13s)

just open up the overview too and just


[01:19:17,309 --> 01:19:20,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m17s)

just to see


[01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:29,950](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m24s)

yeah I don't think we're gonna find much


[01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:39,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m27s)

implementing your theme I don't think


[01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:50,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m29s)

that's gonna get me anywhere okay so


[01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:52,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m39s)

this list that's interesting we kind of


[01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m50s)

support this but it would be nice to


[01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:56,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m52s)

have a nice easy way to do this similar


[01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:59,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m54s)

way the xamarin forms has built-in view


[01:19:56,470 --> 01:20:03,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m56s)

cells might be nice to consider that at


[01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:05,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h19m59s)

some point I don't know how important it


[01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m03s)

is to people but I have I have


[01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m05s)

considered going through trying to build


[01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:12,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m07s)

out these simple demos like this and in


[01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:16,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m10s)

some areas it's a lot harder in our


[01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:19,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m12s)

library than it needs to be so it


[01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:25,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m16s)

doesn't mention anything on the scroll


[01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:32,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m19s)

nothing on the scroll nothing on the


[01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:40,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m25s)

scroll I think what we probably go for


[01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:41,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m32s)

is mimicking this scroll bar here that's


[01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:46,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m40s)

right now it seems like the most


[01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:49,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m41s)

reasonable thing I've got this is all


[01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:52,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m46s)

list related and list item stuff just


[01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:55,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m49s)

great but has absolutely nothing to do


[01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:56,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m52s)

it doesn't show off the scrolling and


[01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:59,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m55s)

that's one of the kind of fundamental


[01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:03,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m56s)

problems yeah this is the actual slider


[01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:07,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h20m59s)

control is because material design was


[01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:11,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m03s)

initially written for Android some of


[01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:15,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m07s)

the things that involve cursor or mouse


[01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:18,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m11s)

interaction just aren't really defined


[01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:19,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m15s)

because it's it's largely driven by what


[01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m18s)

would make for a really great touch


[01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:23,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m19s)

interaction which is fine I mean that's


[01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:29,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m22s)

what it was designed for but we're kind


[01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:33,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m23s)

of repurposing this design specification


[01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:36,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m29s)

onto a runtime that wasn't that it


[01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:37,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m33s)

wasn't really designed for so


[01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m36s)

not that it's bad it just means that


[01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:42,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m37s)

there's ambiguity that we have to


[01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:44,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m39s)

resolve so I think what I'm going to


[01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:47,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m42s)

just jump back to this page real quick I


[01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:49,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m44s)

think what I'm going to do is well use


[01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:50,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m47s)

the current one as a good starting


[01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:56,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m49s)

template but I think I want to have it


[01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:59,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m50s)

pick up so I like the dark in there the


[01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:02,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m56s)

press and then even darker while you're


[01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:03,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h21m59s)

while you're once it's got a mouse


[01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:05,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m02s)

capturing its scrolling so I think


[01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:08,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m03s)

that's the one thing that we're missing


[01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:12,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m05s)

is that press interaction and I think


[01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:16,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m08s)

I'm okay with having this style be the


[01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:17,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m12s)

new default inside of it because this is


[01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:21,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m16s)

because we've effectively got the same


[01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:24,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m17s)

thing right here actually let me pull


[01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:26,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m21s)

that up side by side so the one thing


[01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:31,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m24s)

I'm noticing right out the gate is that


[01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:34,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m26s)

the lightness / darkness of this is this


[01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:38,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m31s)

guy could probably go for being a little


[01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:41,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m34s)

darker to begin with because this guy's


[01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:45,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m38s)

not even the same then more when it goes


[01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:54,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m41s)

down so let's let's take a quick peek


[01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:59,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m45s)

see and see what hey come back let's see


[01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:02,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m54s)

if we can grab this Dom element hoping


[01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:05,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h22m59s)

to see if I can grab whatever this


[01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m02s)

sidebar is


[01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:16,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m09s)

now it may come as a shock to some


[01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:19,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m12s)

people but I am NOT a great web


[01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:23,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m16s)

developer so I kind of just I know a lot


[01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:29,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m19s)

and then plenty to be dangerous but not


[01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:32,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m23s)

really enough to where is I wonder if


[01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:33,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m29s)

it's and if I'm already on the right


[01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:42,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m32s)

element I bet you it's this nav element


[01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:48,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m33s)

that actually gets styled so just scroll


[01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:55,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m42s)

bar width something's changing there and


[01:23:48,900 --> 01:24:05,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m48s)

I don't don't really see where it's


[01:23:55,830 --> 01:24:11,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h23m55s)

changing so border right color is that


[01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:13,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m05s)

what it's using block with an opacity is


[01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m11s)

that the idea


[01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:28,809](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m24s)

regardless so regardless of what that's


[01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:31,149](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m27s)

supposed to be I think we're looking to


[01:24:28,809 --> 01:24:37,479](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m28s)

to mirror that a little better and right


[01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:39,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m31s)

now we are not so back over to code so


[01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:42,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m37s)

we will go into our theme library into


[01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m39s)

the theme and I believe we saw from our


[01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:48,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m42s)

pull request that all the changes from


[01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:58,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m44s)

this are in scroll bar and scroll viewer


[01:24:48,360 --> 01:25:02,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m48s)

right and I think scroll bar here and


[01:24:58,889 --> 01:25:07,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h24m58s)

what do you do


[01:25:02,099 --> 01:25:12,399](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m02s)

scroll bar button materials I repeat


[01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:15,519](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m07s)

button scroll bar thumb vertical so


[01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:18,869](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m12s)

these are these are probably the ones


[01:25:15,519 --> 01:25:21,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m15s)

that I'm interested in playing with


[01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:22,079](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m18s)

because those are effectively the same


[01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:26,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m21s)

thing


[01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:26,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m22s)

there's the material design scroll bar


[01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:38,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m31s)

a little surprised what I don't see


[01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:48,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m41s)

interesting okay so the template


[01:25:44,160 --> 01:26:05,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m44s)

templates outside the style which is


[01:25:48,100 --> 01:26:07,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h25m48s)

fine and this guy here so foreground and


[01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:10,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m05s)

this is probably part of the issue is


[01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:16,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m07s)

this material design selection it's a


[01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:16,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m10s)

little a little weak I think we have


[01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:38,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m19s)

under the where's the dark and light


[01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:45,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m32s)

just do this oh it's actually over in


[01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:49,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m38s)

the main live got it okay let's look at


[01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:50,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m45s)

light real quick that was the one that


[01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:54,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m49s)

was effectively a little far off so this


[01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:55,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m50s)

guy is using for the foreground color on


[01:26:54,220 --> 01:27:07,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m54s)

this guy


[01:26:55,890 --> 01:27:07,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h26m55s)

material design selection which is here


[01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:15,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m07s)

and I'm wondering if this is expected to


[01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:23,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m11s)

be a little bit darker so do we have


[01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:26,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m15s)

anything that is specific don't don't we


[01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m23s)

don't we don't


[01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,539](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m31s)

[Music]


[01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:52,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m41s)

I'm not seeing where this guy okay so


[01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:56,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m51s)

then what do you switch to because you


[01:27:52,980 --> 01:28:04,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m52s)

clearly had a different style when the


[01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:07,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h27m56s)

mouse went over you orientation on it so


[01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:13,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m04s)

I think that's probably in the thumb so


[01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:16,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m07s)

once again so it's switching between


[01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:20,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m13s)

divider and selection when the mouse is


[01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:23,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m16s)

over and then it's sticking with a


[01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:26,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m20s)

divider when dragging I don't think this


[01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:28,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m23s)

is correct I think this is sort of the


[01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m26s)

problem that we want to solve so that


[01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m28s)

while this is being more importantly


[01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:39,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m30s)

while it's dragging or while the mouse


[01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:39,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m33s)

is down we want to darken that up


[01:28:51,580 --> 01:29:00,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m51s)

so let's look at one more thing real


[01:28:54,080 --> 01:29:06,980](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h28m54s)

quick so WPF default control templates


[01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:11,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m00s)

I'm curious if there is an actual key


[01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:15,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m06s)

for the scroll bar color and that we


[01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:19,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m11s)

should take use of so let's see scroll


[01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:27,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m15s)

viewer styles and templates just jump


[01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:31,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m19s)

into here so this is the lets a scroll


[01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:36,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m27s)

bar control template so i'm curious


[01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:36,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m31s)

where you page button scroll bar thumb


[01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m43s)

interesting for that is


[01:29:54,420 --> 01:30:00,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m54s)

yeah because you'll notice that


[01:29:55,890 --> 01:30:02,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h29m55s)

scrollbar even in chrome has a bit


[01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:05,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m00s)

darker of a color I'm thinking what we


[01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:05,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m02s)

might want to do


[01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:16,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m05s)

it's just muddled with the city of it a


[01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m12s)

little bit so I'm thinking so let's


[01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:20,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m16s)

let's just play around for a minute


[01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:24,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m17s)

Tarot design selection so we throw that


[01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:33,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m20s)

guy in there right and then I think what


[01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:36,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m24s)

we do is we HD said it's something like


[01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:40,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m33s)

0.7 all right


[01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:51,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m36s)

and then on mouse-over rather than this


[01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:53,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m40s)

setter we do we zero it out it doesn't


[01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:57,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m51s)

really give me a good darkening one


[01:30:53,250 --> 01:31:01,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m53s)

while dragging think about that for a


[01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:13,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h30m57s)

minute so then let's go here trigger


[01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:15,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m01s)

properties is I think rather than think


[01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:24,120](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m13s)

his mouse captured it's what we're


[01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:31,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m15s)

looking for true actually what we're


[01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:40,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m24s)

gonna do real quick so when in doubt the


[01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:44,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m31s)

fuchsia is big and ugly let's just


[01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:46,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m40s)

relaunch this guy here and we'll take a


[01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:49,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m44s)

look and see where the where this


[01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:52,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m46s)

fuchsia actually lines up but I think


[01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:57,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m49s)

this is probably what we're looking for


[01:31:52,100 --> 01:32:01,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m52s)

to simulate this same behavior for the


[01:31:57,770 --> 01:32:03,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h31m57s)

for this scroll bar here because I think


[01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:06,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m01s)

somewhat mimicking what the Chrome's


[01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:08,159](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m03s)

look of this scroll bar with what's


[01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:10,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m06s)

being done here with the minimal


[01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:14,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m08s)

style without the repeat buttons on the


[01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:17,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m10s)

top it is also interesting that if you


[01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:19,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m14s)

click I guess no it does do the small


[01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:22,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m17s)

and large jumps it's just that the jumps


[01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:24,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m19s)

are set really big and that could be an


[01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,449](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m22s)

artifact of the web not necessarily


[01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:32,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m24s)

always having a hundred percent control


[01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:37,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m27s)

on the the browser itself or my own


[01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:37,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m32s)

ignorance of web development


[01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:57,730](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m47s)

let's take a look at this and say it was


[01:32:55,210 --> 01:33:09,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m55s)

the buttons oh no we were just using


[01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:14,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h32m57s)

this guy right here what we oh so 1 not


[01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:14,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m09s)

0 it's probably better


[01:33:20,339 --> 01:33:25,249](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m20s)

so light slightly darker onmouseover


[01:33:26,749 --> 01:33:33,059](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m26s)

doesn't actually change it so the mouse


[01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:39,899](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m29s)

capture must not be happening in there


[01:33:33,059 --> 01:33:43,519](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m33s)

so let's make you like blue make sure


[01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:43,519](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m39s)

that that guy triggers where we expect


[01:33:44,209 --> 01:33:48,629](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m44s)

so it is the dragging property because


[01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:51,449](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m46s)

as soon as this goes down even it with


[01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:53,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m48s)

my out my mouse moving it is flipping


[01:33:51,449 --> 01:33:58,949](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m51s)

over so that's the one that needs to end


[01:33:53,099 --> 01:34:03,019](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m53s)

up being darker I'm almost tempted to


[01:33:58,949 --> 01:34:03,019](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h33m58s)

just straight up use black


[01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:24,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m18s)

I'm really hesitant like I like the idea


[01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:27,329](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m21s)

of one of these


[01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:31,389](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m24s)

I'm just really hesitant to dive in


[01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:37,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m27s)

headfirst and use them let's jump over


[01:34:31,389 --> 01:34:41,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m31s)

here and do let's try this guy so that's


[01:34:37,989 --> 01:34:41,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m37s)

the one we were using


[01:34:48,579 --> 01:34:52,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h34m48s)

that's full on right there


[01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:06,930](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m00s)

boy seems like that it's just not dark


[01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:10,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m05s)

enough and I'm really hesitant to add


[01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:14,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m06s)

new new brushes here when we don't


[01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:14,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m10s)

necessarily need them


[01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:27,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m15s)

so that's right we were looking to see


[01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:27,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m17s)

if there was a binding background


[01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:50,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m39s)

this would allow for a little bit


[01:35:41,480 --> 01:36:00,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m41s)

cleaner so let's do this set our


[01:35:50,210 --> 01:36:00,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h35m50s)

property background you dynamic resource


[01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:16,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m03s)

and then this just becomes template


[01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:18,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m12s)

binding background so that'll make it a


[01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:30,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m16s)

little easier to override especially if


[01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:39,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m18s)

we go this a city route I just not


[01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:42,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m30s)

working even if full let's just black


[01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:46,429](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m39s)

this even with no transparency to it it


[01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:53,570](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m42s)

still has because the brush has an ax


[01:36:46,429 --> 01:36:55,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m46s)

pasty set on it it is so let's I hate


[01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:58,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m53s)

doing this but let's just look at this


[01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:58,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h36m55s)

right if we do this


[01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:18,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m07s)

and that gets us that gets us really


[01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:19,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m09s)

really close wait a minute what's going


[01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:22,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m18s)

on here


[01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m19s)

how is that


[01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:36,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m30s)

that's relaunch because that the I would


[01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:41,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m33s)

not have expected it to give me that


[01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:46,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m36s)

mouse-over effect because I would have


[01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:49,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m41s)

expected the opacity to be already at


[01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:56,790](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m46s)

one and so this setter here should have


[01:37:49,230 --> 01:38:06,210](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m49s)

had no effect I'm a little shocked that


[01:37:56,790 --> 01:38:07,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h37m56s)

that would that that would do it I think


[01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:10,830](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m06s)

we can effectively get rid of this


[01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:12,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m07s)

trigger here too I am wondering if we


[01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:14,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m10s)

got ourselves into a little bit of a bad


[01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:18,030](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m12s)

state because the sam'l edit continue is


[01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m14s)

great and it works really well right up


[01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:22,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m18s)

until it doesn't


[01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:25,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m18s)

and then you occasionally have to


[01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:37,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m22s)

relaunch so something is causing this


[01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:42,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m25s)

guide to actually have interesting so


[01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:46,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m37s)

let's something else let's look and see


[01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:54,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m42s)

if there's anything else that might be


[01:38:46,470 --> 01:39:00,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m46s)

messing with this so there's an enabled


[01:38:54,180 --> 01:39:08,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h38m54s)

setter which makes sense scrollbar


[01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:08,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m00s)

button this is on a repeat button


[01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:24,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m16s)

this oh I wonder if this is hosting it


[01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:29,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m21s)

and this is well no this is an enabled


[01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:33,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m24s)

check there was a background and a


[01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:38,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m29s)

border brush that's being set here but


[01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:43,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m33s)

could that be what's doing it that's


[01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:46,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m38s)

let's keep looking so that's an abled


[01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:52,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m43s)

scroll bar thumb vertical which is what


[01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:55,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m46s)

we were messing with okay I don't see it


[01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:58,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m52s)

and when we don't see it we fire up our


[01:39:55,240 --> 01:40:01,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m55s)

old pal snoop and we take a look at what


[01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:02,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h39m58s)

is going on with this because when the


[01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:05,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m01s)

mouse isn't over with this I would


[01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:08,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m02s)

expect this scrollbar to be black black


[01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:12,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m05s)

black or I would expect the thumb to be


[01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:16,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m08s)

black because we have set its background


[01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:18,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m12s)

to black with the template binding


[01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:24,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m16s)

straight into it so I don't expect this


[01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:27,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m18s)

to be showing a an optional color here


[01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:31,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m24s)

so let's snoop fire up and target the


[01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:35,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m27s)

application then we're gonna take a look


[01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:37,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m31s)

and see what is going on so pro tip with


[01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:39,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m35s)

snoop when you fire it up put your


[01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:43,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m37s)

cursor over the element that you want to


[01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:45,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m39s)

inspect and press control-shift and


[01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:49,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m43s)

it'll automatically navigate your visual


[01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:53,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m45s)

tree and snoop into the element under


[01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:55,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m49s)

your cursor it doesn't 100% work because


[01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:57,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m53s)

hit testing if you're trying to target a


[01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:59,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m55s)

control that isn't easily hit testable


[01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:00,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m57s)

it's not always clear which elements


[01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:03,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h40m59s)

under the cursor and it and sometimes


[01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:04,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m00s)

you kind of have to target a nearby


[01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m03s)

element and then just navigate your way


[01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:10,140](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m04s)

in but it'll get you a whole heck of a


[01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:12,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m06s)

lot closer than trying to go through and


[01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:16,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m10s)

manually just go through this nesting


[01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:18,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m12s)

that'll take forever so things that we


[01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:23,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m16s)

are interested in so also worth noting


[01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:25,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m18s)

this filter here you can just type in


[01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:29,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m23s)

what you're looking to search on and you


[01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:32,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m25s)

can do pipe to do or conditions


[01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:36,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m29s)

so let's see we want opacity maybe


[01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:39,640](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m32s)

background and let's just see what's


[01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:49,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m36s)

happening so this guy claims to be black


[01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:56,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m39s)

a pasty of one hovering on him makes no


[01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:58,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m49s)

effect let's look here is the background


[01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:02,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m56s)

and let's look at the fill property too


[01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:07,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h41m58s)

so this guy also seems to claim all the


[01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:15,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m02s)

way through which means this has to be


[01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:15,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m07s)

coming from higher up it's not there


[01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:28,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m17s)

it's not there vertical scrollbar aha


[01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:30,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m21s)

the entire vertical scroll bar has the


[01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:34,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m28s)

fact that I'm seeing that number not


[01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:43,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m30s)

jump I'm seeing an animate means that


[01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:50,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m34s)

guy is our culprit and he is guessing on


[01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:54,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m43s)

the scroll viewer and probably either in


[01:42:50,340 --> 01:43:01,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m50s)

these storyboards these are being done


[01:42:54,820 --> 01:43:02,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h42m54s)

with triggers we should probably look


[01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m01s)

real quick


[01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:08,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m02s)

I suspect we can get away typically I


[01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:11,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m04s)

try to avoid triggers like this in favor


[01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:13,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m08s)

of using the visual state manager so we


[01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:16,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m11s)

might look real quick and just see what


[01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:18,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m13s)

visual states are available to us


[01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m16s)

because we can switch those to a visual


[01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:26,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m18s)

state manager that would be my


[01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:29,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m21s)

preference it doesn't always mean that


[01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:32,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m26s)

it's an option let's look at the scroll


[01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:32,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m29s)

viewer itself


[01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:39,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m36s)

okay


[01:43:49,420 --> 01:44:02,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m49s)

yeah so this guy doesn't have the visual


[01:43:55,190 --> 01:44:06,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h43m55s)

state for it valid invalid focus so I'm


[01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:11,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m02s)

thinking that's probably part of the


[01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:16,310](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m06s)

problem is we should because the scroll


[01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:20,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m11s)

bar itself has the visual States so I'm


[01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:23,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m16s)

thinking part of this is this part of


[01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:29,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m20s)

the template here needs to go away and


[01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:32,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m23s)

this logic should get migrated into the


[01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:36,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m29s)

scroll bar itself that way we can take


[01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:39,380](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m32s)

advantage of the visual state manager


[01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m36s)

just probably better so let's take a


[01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:47,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m39s)

look so what is what exactly is this guy


[01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:55,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m41s)

doing he's just taking the scroll bars


[01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:55,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h44m47s)

and animating the opacity from one 2.56


[01:45:02,419 --> 01:45:08,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m02s)

and I'm thinking there's a bug right


[01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:08,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m06s)

here


[01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:25,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m12s)

and that that is actually expected to be


[01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:29,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m15s)

a one because that'll do no animations


[01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:34,410](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m25s)

that's probably part of it okay so this


[01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:35,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m29s)

guy is just doing these animations and I


[01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:38,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m34s)

think what we're gonna do is we're just


[01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:44,700](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m35s)

going to whack these guys so we don't


[01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:46,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m38s)

need any of those so on mouse-over we


[01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:48,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m44s)

expect to go or I should say when the


[01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:52,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m46s)

mouse is not over it we expect the


[01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:55,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m48s)

opacity to be it will 56 then when the


[01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:57,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m52s)

mouse is over it we go to one in


[01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m55s)

two-tenths of a second so let's go back


[01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:04,230](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h45m57s)

to our scroll bar and let's take


[01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:11,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m00s)

advantage of our visual state manager so


[01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:17,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m04s)

in here yeah I think we want to do this


[01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:17,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m11s)

here so


[01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:25,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m20s)

and we might actually even be able to


[01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:35,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m22s)

cheat if we just go over here you can


[01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:37,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m25s)

probably grab this guy a lot of times I


[01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:41,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m35s)

find it's easier to just grab the


[01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:46,490](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m37s)

existing visual state manager this is


[01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:49,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m41s)

targeting the repeat button though some


[01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:49,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h46m46s)

vertical scrollbar


[01:47:01,419 --> 01:47:05,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m01s)

oh so maybe I've got the wrong control


[01:47:03,789 --> 01:47:11,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m03s)

together and this should actually be


[01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:11,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m05s)

going on the style for the repeat button


[01:47:11,909 --> 01:47:20,559](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m11s)

so scrollbar states but it does say that


[01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:27,820](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m17s)

the scroll bar has the following visual


[01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:29,709](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m20s)

states their template just does not show


[01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:30,639](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m27s)

them because there's the thumb vertical


[01:47:29,709 --> 01:47:33,669](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m29s)

scrollbar


[01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:38,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m30s)

there's the grid at the root of the


[01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:41,050](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m33s)

control template a track and they are


[01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:43,539](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m38s)

not applying it they're only setting


[01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:51,099](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m41s)

these ones so it's the normal mouse over


[01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:54,789](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m43s)

pressed disabled mouse over disabled so


[01:47:51,099 --> 01:48:01,769](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m51s)

not quite the same visual States but we


[01:47:54,789 --> 01:48:04,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h47m54s)

want to grab normal mouse over and


[01:48:01,769 --> 01:48:07,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m01s)

disabled I think are probably the three


[01:48:04,269 --> 01:48:07,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m04s)

that we're going to care about


[01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:26,649](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m12s)

so let's go back paste normal mouse over


[01:48:22,469 --> 01:48:31,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m22s)

we're not gonna do pressed we are


[01:48:26,649 --> 01:48:37,209](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m26s)

probably going to do disabled and let's


[01:48:31,269 --> 01:48:45,329](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m31s)

go back over here and just steal one of


[01:48:37,209 --> 01:48:55,409](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m37s)

these storyboards real quick so you


[01:48:45,329 --> 01:48:55,409](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m45s)

think in the normal case we want to


[01:48:55,649 --> 01:49:02,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h48m55s)

let's look at this real quick gradient


[01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:06,119](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m00s)

key time these are just straight-up


[01:49:02,889 --> 01:49:12,579](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m02s)

setters they aren't actually doing


[01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:15,839](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m06s)

transitions that's okay that is okay by


[01:49:12,579 --> 01:49:19,769](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m12s)

me I think we can set these a little


[01:49:15,839 --> 01:49:25,689](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m15s)

attached properties a little higher


[01:49:19,769 --> 01:49:33,249](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m19s)

there so double animation so we are


[01:49:25,689 --> 01:49:36,869](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m25s)

going to be targeting what we've got a


[01:49:33,249 --> 01:49:43,749](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m33s)

border with a track sitting on top of it


[01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:46,589](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m36s)

oh and that's interesting is enabled is


[01:49:43,749 --> 01:49:53,319](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m43s)

being bound to his mouse over is that


[01:49:46,589 --> 01:50:02,159](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m46s)

that feels like a mistake where is the


[01:49:53,319 --> 01:50:02,159](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h49m53s)

control arrow they're not in line


[01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:22,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m06s)

I'm not sure we want is enabled being


[01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:25,760](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m10s)

bound to is mouse over scrollbar thumb


[01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:35,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m22s)

the styles getting applied border brush


[01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:35,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m25s)

background increase repeat button yeah


[01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:46,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m39s)

decrease repeat button so top button


[01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:53,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m43s)

thumb in the middle


[01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:59,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m46s)

scroll down button and this is largely


[01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:59,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h50m53s)

what's driving this


[01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:06,409](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m00s)

so that's funny


[01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:19,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m11s)

boys so much something so simple is yeah


[01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:19,989](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m16s)

it's so complicated


[01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:24,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m20s)

okay so let's go back to where we were


[01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:26,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m23s)

going


[01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:33,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m24s)

so I think what we were saying is we


[01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:39,350](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m26s)

were going to target the pasty of the


[01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:42,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m33s)

track because this was initially being


[01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:44,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m39s)

done higher up and targeting the entire


[01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:54,290](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m42s)

scroll bar so if we target something a


[01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:56,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m44s)

little more nested I think is there


[01:51:54,290 --> 01:52:00,200](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m54s)

expected to be it's the thumb expected


[01:51:56,330 --> 01:52:03,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h51m56s)

to be named no but it is expected to


[01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:05,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m00s)

have a track part it's just to make sure


[01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:11,739](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m03s)

we've got all the template parts defined


[01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:23,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m05s)

so just track okay which it is declared


[01:52:11,739 --> 01:52:25,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m11s)

so on normal will go at zero and then


[01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:28,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m23s)

this should be the opposite of oh five


[01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:28,000](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m25s)

six


[01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:52,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m32s)

promises this is making an implicit idea


[01:52:35,389 --> 01:52:52,360](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m35s)

of where this should go to interesting


[01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:58,010](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m53s)

it's like if I guess I'm left with an


[01:52:56,419 --> 01:53:02,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m56s)

interesting choice then


[01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:05,599](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h52m58s)

so I've detoured several times so let's


[01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:07,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m02s)

just back up and reorient for the most


[01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,329](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m05s)

part so we'll collapse this because


[01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:10,669](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m07s)

we're really just concerned with these


[01:53:08,329 --> 01:53:13,939](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m08s)

two Styles here for the moment because


[01:53:10,669 --> 01:53:22,789](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m10s)

we've got the individual thumb which


[01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:28,849](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m13s)

needs to do something probably on this


[01:53:22,789 --> 01:53:31,219](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m22s)

overlay here so there's some amount so


[01:53:28,849 --> 01:53:36,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m28s)

this mouse over really doesn't matter


[01:53:31,219 --> 01:53:40,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m31s)

right so I think what actually needs to


[01:53:36,889 --> 01:53:48,219](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m36s)

happen is this needs to go away this guy


[01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:48,219](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m40s)

needs to move down here and this guy


[01:53:48,459 --> 01:53:57,229](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m48s)

needs to be something like this right so


[01:53:52,269 --> 01:54:01,909](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m52s)

the mouse over effect will be controlled


[01:53:57,229 --> 01:54:07,159](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h53m57s)

at the scrollbar the darkening when you


[01:54:01,909 --> 01:54:09,889](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m01s)

start dragging will be controlled I'll


[01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:12,229](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m07s)

turn off the blue will be controlled on


[01:54:09,889 --> 01:54:15,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m09s)

the the thumb itself so when you start


[01:54:12,229 --> 01:54:18,709](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m12s)

dry so you initially hover over this guy


[01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:20,239](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m15s)

is going to get 80% of whatever this


[01:54:18,709 --> 01:54:26,439](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m18s)

background is which is currently black


[01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:29,449](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m20s)

right so this thing will be 80% black


[01:54:26,439 --> 01:54:31,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m26s)

with whatever additional opacity is


[01:54:29,449 --> 01:54:36,579](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m29s)

applied here because this is going to be


[01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:39,199](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m31s)

effectively mean its multiplicative


[01:54:36,579 --> 01:54:42,979](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m36s)

because this scroll bar contains the


[01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:45,770](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m39s)

thumb itself and then when we start


[01:54:42,979 --> 01:54:47,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m42s)

dragging we'll get slightly darker


[01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:50,960](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m45s)

by moving this from point eight to one


[01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:55,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m47s)

but I'm guessing or will end up doing is


[01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:57,550](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m50s)

this guy won't be fully at one himself


[01:54:55,060 --> 01:55:01,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m55s)

let's just whack this for the moment


[01:54:57,550 --> 01:55:06,020](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h54m57s)

clear that out we don't need that I


[01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:07,270](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m01s)

mouse over disabled yeah sure we don't


[01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:09,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m06s)

need you either


[01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:15,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m07s)

so we'll clear you out we'll clear you


[01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:17,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m09s)

out and that will go there because this


[01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:21,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m15s)

guy the scroll bar itself is getting a


[01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:26,780](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m17s)

background set of transparent just what


[01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:31,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m21s)

this guy is showing so the scroll bar


[01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:34,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m26s)

itself effectively has no background so


[01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m31s)

whatever this guy is can show through


[01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:43,070](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m37s)

and we are totally hung for the moment


[01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:50,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m40s)

wallet goes through and updates the


[01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:53,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m43s)

universe holy Leon will go through and


[01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:53,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h55m50s)

relaunch


[01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:12,750](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m07s)

and I am getting close to closing out my


[01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:15,060](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m11s)

stream so I don't know if we're quite


[01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:16,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m12s)

gonna finish this I would I would like


[01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:18,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m15s)

to get this in but I'm starting to


[01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:21,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m16s)

realize how much work is going to be


[01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:23,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m18s)

involved in testing all the states for


[01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:26,250](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m21s)

this so this guy might not get done I


[01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m23s)

should say this guy almost assuredly


[01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:29,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m26s)

won't get done tonight but I'd like to


[01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:31,860](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m27s)

get through this next test just to make


[01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:33,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m29s)

sure just to make sure that I'm actually


[01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:36,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m31s)

thinking about this correctly and then


[01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:42,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m33s)

and then figuring out what we're going


[01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:44,880](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m36s)

to do as far as theme sizes it is worth


[01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:49,260](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m42s)

noting that if people want a narrower


[01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:55,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m44s)

width as was mentioned you can control


[01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:56,990](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m49s)

it here it's probably it's probably


[01:56:55,110 --> 01:57:00,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m55s)

worth at least an entry on the wiki page


[01:56:56,990 --> 01:57:01,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h56m56s)

showing an example of doing that that


[01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:05,430](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m00s)

way if you want to go through and change


[01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:08,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m01s)

out your scroll bars you can do so so


[01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:08,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m05s)

that works


[01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:14,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m09s)

the only darkening that happens is when


[01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:23,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m18s)

when the dark knee that happens is when


[01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:29,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m20s)

I'm actually dragging so if we then go


[01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:29,870](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m23s)

through and deal with these states here


[01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:38,969](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m30s)

or the normal state applies a little bit


[01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:48,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m34s)

more opacity to this so we'll take that


[01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:48,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m38s)

off wait what


[01:57:53,540 --> 01:58:00,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m53s)

the dude did its relaunch so I didn't


[01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:03,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h57m58s)

expect that to actually cause that to


[01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:03,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m00s)

break like that


[01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:21,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m14s)

nope not what I was looking for I think


[01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:25,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m19s)

if we if we go through and implement the


[01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:27,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m21s)

the visual states for this control such


[01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:32,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m25s)

that in normal


[01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:34,670](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m27s)

it applies some opacity to it so it


[01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:37,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m32s)

fades out a little bit more and then on


[01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:43,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m34s)

the mouse over will remove some amount


[01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:49,100](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m37s)

of that and then this guy will have some


[01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:52,520](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m43s)

plied normally and will remove all of it


[01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:54,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m49s)

and go from his perspective opaque but


[01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,910](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m52s)

the final result won't be completely


[01:58:54,080 --> 01:59:02,090](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m54s)

opaque because his parent will still


[01:58:55,910 --> 01:59:02,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h58m55s)

have some amount of a pasty set oh there


[01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:06,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m02s)

we go


[01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:14,720](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m02s)

sped and it's fine so that's that's just


[01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:24,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m06s)

that there so then let's just do this


[01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:24,130](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m14s)

real quick so storyboard and then


[01:59:34,309 --> 01:59:48,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m34s)

see storyboard target property hey city


[01:59:41,510 --> 02:00:02,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m41s)

storyboard target its target name isn't


[01:59:48,510 --> 02:00:09,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=01h59m48s)

it yeah track and then what is it


[02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:14,909](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m02s)

double animation oh can I just do we can


[02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:18,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m09s)

go to so on normal we'll go another 0.8


[02:00:14,909 --> 02:00:26,309](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m14s)

right so it'll go from wherever it's at


[02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:30,269](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m18s)

2.8 then on mouse-over it'll go will be


[02:00:26,309 --> 02:00:40,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m26s)

explicit about this guy here it'll let


[02:00:30,269 --> 02:00:42,709](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m30s)

that be reversed and go to one right and


[02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:45,840](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m40s)

then obviously undisciplined


[02:00:42,709 --> 02:00:54,869](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m42s)

we should do something else so that it


[02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:56,429](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m45s)

goes you know more great out as long as


[02:00:54,869 --> 02:01:00,630](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m54s)

this guy works and we at least get the


[02:00:56,429 --> 02:01:02,940](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h00m56s)

kind of those three states the the faded


[02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:05,039](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m00s)

and the less faded when the mouse goes


[02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:07,619](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m02s)

over and then the even more or less


[02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:10,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m05s)

faded when I start dragging I'll call


[02:01:07,619 --> 02:01:12,829](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m07s)

this a success and we can call it a


[02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,829](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m10s)

night


[02:01:22,350 --> 02:01:34,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m22s)

come on little buddy there you go there


[02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:41,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m24s)

you go so let's see No so I have done


[02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:41,600](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m34s)

something wrong ha boy


[02:01:49,659 --> 02:01:53,400](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h01m49s)

oh you know what I should check


[02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:06,160](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m02s)

[Music]


[02:02:03,330 --> 02:02:09,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m03s)

okay one little test because it's gonna


[02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:11,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m06s)

bother me if I don't know trying to


[02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:14,530](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m09s)

decide if I a made a mistake on my


[02:02:11,110 --> 02:02:18,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m11s)

storyboards or if this thing is


[02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:21,690](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m14s)

legitimately just wrong so this guy is


[02:02:18,190 --> 02:02:26,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m18s)

track we were supposed to be animating a


[02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:26,610](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m21s)

city 0.8


[02:02:36,070 --> 02:02:49,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m36s)

so it is actually so it's working so


[02:02:41,370 --> 02:02:55,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m41s)

there's a couple problems was duration


[02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:59,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m49s)

should be 0 : 0 1 0 point 2 so the


[02:02:55,180 --> 02:03:05,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m55s)

duration is being inferred which is


[02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:07,810](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h02m59s)

inferring way too long and this value is


[02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:14,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m05s)

apparently not big enough to see easily


[02:03:07,810 --> 02:03:14,220](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m07s)

so do that come back here


[02:03:19,110 --> 02:03:23,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m19s)

so let's get that off of there


[02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:41,590](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m32s)

hahaha three states three states so we


[02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:45,320](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m38s)

wanted so Mouse not over it's lighter


[02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:49,190](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m41s)

mouse over it gets darker mouse down and


[02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:52,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m45s)

drag it gets even darker than that okay


[02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:56,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m49s)

so that makes me feel better there is


[02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:56,740](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m52s)

still an outstanding question of


[02:03:56,890 --> 02:04:00,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m56s)

obviously we don't want to hard-code


[02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:03,080](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h03m58s)

this guy black because you know that


[02:04:00,890 --> 02:04:05,660](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m00s)

fails on dark-themed whatnot so we need


[02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:11,390](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m03s)

to need to deal with that situation but


[02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:13,540](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m05s)

I think we are on the right track no pun


[02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:18,440](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m11s)

intended


[02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:21,650](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m13s)

scrollbar track it must be late my jokes


[02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:24,620](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m18s)

are starting to get bad so with that I


[02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:27,680](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m21s)

think I'm going to call it and we will


[02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:29,480](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m24s)

probably pick this up next time or we'll


[02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:31,850](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m27s)

see if I get it knocked out in the


[02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:36,110](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m29s)

meantime as a reminder for people who


[02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:38,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m31s)

are interested Thursdays stream is going


[02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:42,890](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m36s)

to be more system command line probably


[02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:46,280](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m38s)

related to the rendering library which


[02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:50,150](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m42s)

lets you do some fancy stuff with laying


[02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:52,580](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m46s)

out your output for being able to say


[02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:54,500](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m50s)

you want to output like a grid of


[02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:56,920](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m52s)

information that kind of thing or have


[02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:59,510](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m54s)

an automatically updating progress bar


[02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:02,180](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m56s)

so we will probably be looking at that


[02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:06,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h04m59s)

maybe fixing bugs add some features that


[02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:08,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m02s)

sort of thing and we will go from there


[02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:11,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m06s)

and have some fun but we will rest


[02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:12,710](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m08s)

assured this material design library


[02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:15,170](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m11s)

will still be getting some work done on


[02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:17,900](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m12s)

it in the meantime even if it's not


[02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:20,330](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m15s)

necessarily on the live stream so thank


[02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:22,340](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m17s)

you everybody for watching as always I


[02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:26,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m20s)

do appreciate it when people tell me


[02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:28,370](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m22s)

that they've watched or are interested


[02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:30,800](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m26s)

in me continuing to do these so if


[02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:31,970](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m28s)

that's you and you're enjoying these and

[02:05:31,970 --> 02:05:35,300](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m31s)

appreciate it if people subscribe or


[02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:37,460](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m34s)

shoot me a message or something so that


[02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:41,240](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m35s)

I don't feel that my time is completely


[02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:44,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m37s)

wasted so with that I'm gonna say


[02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:44,470](https://youtu.be/rCVff4xix0c?t=02h05m41s)

goodnight have a good one
