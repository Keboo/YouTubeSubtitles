[okay sorry for my tardiness tonight I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m26s)



[was running a little behind getting kids](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m30s)



[down and my computer system set up I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m32s)



[playing with some new Mouse new hardware](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m35s)



[and was having fun getting things set up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m38s)



[and configured so good evening tide I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m40s)



[never know how to trust my viewercount](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m43s)



[because it's showing me zero right now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m45s)



[which clearly isn't completely right so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m47s)



[tonight I was going to start off going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m51s)



[through taking one of my sample apps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m54s)



[I'll grab the the repo link here for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h01m58s)



[anybody who wants to follow along but I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m00s)



[was going to go through and show](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m03s)



[upgrading this app over to the new to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m06s)



[600 PI's and what that looks like and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m11s)



[how much code it can theoretically save](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m16s)



[you now I did technically cheat ahead of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m19s)



[time and I went through and tested this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m21s)



[so spoiler alert I know ahead of time](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m25s)



[that it should be working though I did](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m29s)



[push some changes and we're gonna try a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m32s)



[new nougat package what could possibly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m33s)



[go wrong with trying stuff with the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m36s)



[latest and greatest so there's the repo](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m39s)



[link for anybody who wants to actually](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m41s)



[follow along and look let me switch here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m44s)



[okay so let's dive here and I will just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m48s)



[fire this up and show off what this app](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m53s)



[does so I initially wrote this as a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h02m56s)



[proof of concept on the the old to 5x](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m03s)



[interface or API for what it takes to do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m07s)



[custom theming so a lot of this stuff is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m11s)



[based heavily in law around what you see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m13s)



[in the demo app but you'll notice](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m16s)



[there's a couple interesting bits in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m19s)



[that this is actually my apps in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m20s)



[addition to the normal material design](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m23s)



[and zamel so we've got the normal](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m25s)



[material design built in palettes at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m28s)



[least as they were called in the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m33s)



[two-five oh we've got light theme dark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m34s)



[theme you can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m36s)



[your tab stuff there but the interesting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m38s)



[one are these final two themes that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m40s)



[we've got down here so you can see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m43s)



[they've got special colors for their](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m45s)



[primary mid and light the accent colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m47s)



[are a little odd they change out here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m49s)



[and these two are both custom themes and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m53s)



[this is the area that was really painful](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m56s)



[on the old API going through and saying](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h03m59s)



[oh I want something beyond the normal](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m03s)



[built-in color schemes and also I want](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m05s)



[to let my users toggle between my custom](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m08s)



[themes and the built-in themes was not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m10s)



[necessarily trivial and this is this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m13s)



[whole app is sort of a testament to how](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m15s)



[complex it was so I'm just going to walk](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m18s)



[through a little bit of this code and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m21s)



[then we're gonna throw a lot of it away](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m22s)



[as we update to the new one this writing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m24s)



[this was kind of proof that I needed to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m26s)



[jump in and actually do something about](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m29s)



[the API so there's got so well let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m31s)



[let's start with the sam'l that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m36s)



[probably the easier one so it's a fairly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m38s)



[simple layout there is an item's control](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m41s)



[which is bound to the theme colors this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m43s)



[uses a theme color view model as its](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m46s)



[data template and this data template is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m50s)



[really just a fancy button with that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m53s)



[ellipse and text box inside of it so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m55s)



[this kind of look that you see here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h04m58s)



[obviously I spent a not a whole lot on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m01s)



[the design of this but got it just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m04s)



[laying out as much as I needed to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m06s)



[and then then down underneath there is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m08s)



[some color zones because these are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m11s)



[really easy to show off the color themes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m13s)



[for the primary mid light as well as the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m16s)



[inverted colors and then a tab control](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m19s)



[because it's one of the MA apps themes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m22s)



[that styles and uses quite a few of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m25s)



[brushes so it makes it easy to kind of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m27s)



[just show off especially with like the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m29s)



[the press color the hover color and all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m30s)



[of that going through and showing that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m33s)



[off the view model itself it pulls from](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m35s)



[the old swatch provider not all of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m40s)



[swatches in the to five Oh actually have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m44s)



[accent colors as well so it limits](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m47s)



[itself down to just the swatches](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m50s)



[that actually have accents and then goes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m52s)



[and creates these this theme object and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h05m56s)



[puts that into with a view model so this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m00s)



[theme object itself looks a lot like the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m03s)



[old API in that it keeps a list of hues](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m07s)



[it's got some indexes into that list as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m10s)



[far as which one's the light mid and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m14s)



[dark and then it's also got a secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m15s)



[accent hue and then it has the ability](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m18s)



[to go through and generate a palette](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m21s)



[which in the to 500 interface was the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m23s)



[effectively complete color theme so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m25s)



[every time you build up one of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m29s)



[little colors its building up one of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m32s)



[these theme objects and then those in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m34s)



[turn are being shoved into a view model](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m38s)



[which just makes it a little easier to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m41s)



[pull off a sample brush which is what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m43s)



[gets used to show off this color in the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m45s)



[ellipse as well as a name and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m48s)



[obviously the theme that it needs to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m51s)



[through and do it so and these are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m53s)



[pretty simple and straightforward setups](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m54s)



[in general I'd probably tell people](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h06m57s)



[avoid view models with brushes in them I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m00s)



[tend to advocate for not having view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m05s)



[models reference anything inside of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m09s)



[system windows namespace usually that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m11s)



[an indicator that you're mixing view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m14s)



[code with your view models so in general](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m16s)



[normally what I would do is just expose](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m19s)



[up the color and then let a value](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m21s)



[convert or convert between the color and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m25s)



[brush because really this view model](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m26s)



[only has a color the fact that it's a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m29s)



[solid color brush is an implementation](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m30s)



[detail of the view and view model should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m32s)



[be agnostic of your views I tend to be a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m35s)



[more of an mvvm purist in that regard](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m38s)



[but the most important thing is that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m41s)



[your app ships so whatever gets you to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m43s)



[there quickest and hopefully unit tested](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m45s)



[so this is the the whole app there is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m48s)



[this palette helper class that I ended](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m52s)



[up writing because part of the old to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m55s)



[five-o interface oh cool](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h07m59s)



[remind me tide once I get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m04s)



[through this I want to come back and and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m06s)



[look at that question because I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m07s)



[this may help a little bit with doing it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m10s)



[so on the MA app side of things this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m12s)



[palette helper is deriving from the old](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m15s)



[palette helper because all of the MA](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m17s)



[apps have a bunch of built-in brushes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m20s)



[that need to get set in order for all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m22s)



[the MA apps controls to actually have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m25s)



[their color thing set which is why I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m29s)



[left this sort of tab control in here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m31s)



[just to make sure that things were](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m33s)



[actually propagating correctly and you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m34s)



[can also see some of the brushes in like](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m36s)



[the the window theme or even this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m38s)



[outliner](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m40s)



[if you look really closely there's kind](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m41s)



[of this glow around the outside of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m43s)



[window so all of these usually come in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m45s)



[from one of these brushes and just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m48s)



[getting these set up correctly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m51s)



[now the goal of all of the to 600](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m53s)



[interface was to eliminate this mess so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m57s)



[that you guys don't have to do this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h08m59s)



[because this quite frankly was rather](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m00s)



[painful once I started down the path to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m03s)



[figure out what it was going to take to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m06s)



[actually implement all of this so with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m07s)



[that in mind where we're ultimately](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m10s)



[going is we're gonna switch this app](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m11s)



[over to the to 600 interface and delete](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m13s)



[a bunch of this code because most of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m16s)



[this shouldn't be necessary anymore tied](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m18s)



[when you said you needed help with that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m21s)



[in the color picker what do you mean by](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m22s)



[that is that were you referring to sort](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m25s)



[of the layout and how you create those](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m28s)



[theme objects or was this more regarding](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m30s)



[the palette helper a brush in the view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m32s)



[model okay actually if you want we will](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m37s)



[go through and I think by the end of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m42s)



[this I will I'll whack that brush and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m44s)



[show you how I would end up doing it in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m48s)



[this app and that'll probably leave a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m49s)



[better example so to start from here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m51s)



[we're going to jump into our new get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m56s)



[references and so this is what most apps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h09m58s)



[probably look like today is they're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m02s)



[referencing the to 500 or 251 interface](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m05s)



[and so we are going to cheat and I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m09s)



[going to grab so key part here is check](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m11s)



[the include pre-release and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m15s)



[be looking for the latest CI](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m17s)



[so the to 6o version 1560 I believe is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m20s)



[latest and then my dependency behavior](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m23s)



[I'm setting to highest so it's going to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m25s)



[ultimately grab the the latest on both](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m28s)



[of these other ones as well actually I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m30s)



[think I can probably do both of these so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m32s)



[let's do updates and we'll just jump](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m34s)



[over here and say update all the things](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m37s)



[here and I don't want to grab I need to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m40s)



[look a little closer at what's in the -](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m45s)



[oh ma app stuff because I want to make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m49s)



[sure that there's not necessarily](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m52s)



[theming bits that go into it there might](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m53s)



[be and I might just need to update some](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m57s)



[of our color so we do try to keep in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h10m59s)

[old two five one interface should work](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m43s)



[just fine](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m46s)



[with the new to six Oh packages so if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m46s)



[you're worried about backwards](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m53s)



[compatibility you should be able to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m55s)



[through and update to the two six Oh](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m57s)



[release and as long as you don't do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h11m59s)



[anything else your app should just work](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m03s)



[just fine all the theming stuff should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m04s)



[still work so we're just gonna fire this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m07s)



[up and prove that that much is still](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m09s)

[like I may have broken something in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m15s)



[there I might double check that to make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m17s)



[sure that it's not completely broken and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m20s)



[then something here is something here oh](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m22s)



[this is the theming stuff okay so this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m26s)



[sort of makes sense so this guy in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m30s)



[here is falling apart because he's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m33s)



[trying to set set a ma apps brush that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m36s)



[is no longer there so let's look at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m38s)



[doing this update because some of this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m41s)



[palette helper stuff you'll notice so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m44s)



[for example this palette helper the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m46s)



[replace palette method is now marked as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m48s)



[obsolete so we're gonna mark this guy is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m51s)



[obsolete as well just so I get warnings](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m54s)



[and then we will we will deal with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m56s)



[changing him out so the first thing we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h12m59s)



[want to do is go over to our app dot](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m02s)



[zamel so before we had to pull in for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m05s)



[material design all of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m10s)



[dictionaries and of these dictionaries](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m12s)



[this one for defaults is still somewhat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m15s)



[important this guy brings in all of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m19s)



[default themes for all of the controls](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m22s)



[which is what we need but these three](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m24s)



[resource dictionaries down near the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m26s)



[bottom are all around color theming so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m28s)



[we've got the light color theme that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m30s)



[we're going to start with deep purple as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m32s)



[the primary color and then lime is the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m35s)



[accent color so we don't need these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m37s)



[resource dictionaries anymore](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m40s)



[so these guys can go away I'll just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m41s)



[comment them for now and instead what we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m44s)



[have access to and I believe bundled](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m47s)



[color theme right so that guy should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m50s)



[squawk and go find it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h13m54s)

[the webpage open and bring this guy over](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m11s)



[here so on the top to upload my files so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m13s)



[back on the material design in zamel](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m20s)



[repo demo app because i can't remember](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m23s)

[bundled theme I missed missed one ah](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m32s)



[Thank You Kirk oh I think is if I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m36s)



[saying that right](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m41s)



[fundal theme that's what we're looking](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m46s)



[for okay so this guy has a couple](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m48s)



[properties on him base theme which is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m50s)



[ultimately looking for light or dark oh](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m52s)



[good good to know so there-there is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m55s)



[technically an inherit property this one](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h14m59s)



[is not currently being used there is a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m02s)



[theme assist class if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m05s)



[apply a different color theme at a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m07s)



[subsection of your app that will use](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m09s)



[inherit my plan is to in a later release](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m11s)



[add inherit if it's set at the root to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m16s)



[go out and pull from the if you're on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m19s)



[Windows 8 or Windows 10](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m22s)



[pull the built in theme to know if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m23s)



[you're on light or dark and adjust](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m26s)



[accordingly but currently the only](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m28s)



[things that will make any difference at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m30s)



[the root level are light and dark so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m32s)



[primary color will go with purple or I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m35s)



[sorry deep purple we should match what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m38s)



[we were before and then secondary color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m40s)



[is lime there is a somewhat for anyone](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m44s)



[used to the the terminology of accent](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m48s)



[color there is an intent to switch this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m51s)



[over to using secondary rather than](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m53s)



[accent and I don't know why it is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h15m58s)



[highlighting secondary did I'm typo](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m00s)



[something secondary color nope should be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m02s)



[fine I think that's probably just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m06s)



[resharper losing its mind there is also](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m08s)



[a second option so if you don't want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m11s)



[just do the Tyrael design there is a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m14s)



[second option rather than the the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m23s)



[bundled theme for custom color theme has](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m26s)



[the same type of thing for base theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m30s)



[but then for the primary and secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m31s)



[you can just put in arbitrary colors so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m34s)



[any RGB color that you want what this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m37s)



[will do is it'll set the mid color for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m41s)



[both primary and secondary and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m44s)



[it'll jump up a couple lightness levels](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m46s)



[on the HSV color space and just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m51s)



[automatically pick your light and dark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m53s)



[version so for people who just want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m55s)



[quick and easy way and you don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h16m58s)



[necessarily like the built-in color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m00s)



[themes and want to roll their own this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m01s)



[is a quick and easy way to do it but for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m03s)



[now we're gonna stick with this guy so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m05s)



[that gets that in there that goes light](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m07s)



[and dark but in our case there's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m11s)



[actually one other one that we care](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m14s)



[about so this is bundled theme there's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m15s)



[custom colored theme but there's also ma](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m18s)



[apps bundled theme and this is important](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m21s)



[if you're actually going to be using ma](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m24s)



[apps with your with material design and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m27s)



[the new API so the the only difference](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m30s)



[between this bundled theme and the other](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m33s)



[bundled theme is this one is going to do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m36s)



[all of these brush setters that we did](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m38s)



[manually in our app it's going to handle](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m42s)



[those for us so then you no longer have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m44s)



[to keep track of what are all the ma app](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m46s)



[brushes that I need a set and how do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m49s)



[those map to my material design theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m50s)



[colors if you use the the the bundled](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m52s)



[theme out of the MA apps library it just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m57s)



[pulls it in for you so quick and easy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h17m59s)



[much simpler I like better so we're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m02s)



[going to go with this route the other](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m05s)



[resource dictionaries that you need for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m07s)



[ma apps because these come out of their](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m09s)



[library nothing I can do about those and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m12s)



[then well nothing that I should do about](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m15s)



[those I'll put it that way and then you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m18s)



[also still need to pull in the defaults](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m21s)



[from the material design ma apps just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m24s)



[like you did before because this brings](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m27s)



[in the material design themes for each](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m28s)



[of them so another question so are all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m31s)



[shades automatically calculated based on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m33s)



[primary to match the material design](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m35s)



[rules so the rules are pretty laxed when](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m37s)



[it comes to going up and down a hue](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m41s)



[we've tried to match them as close as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m46s)



[possible but definitely welcome feedback](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m48s)



[if you use these markup extensions](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m50s)



[because all these markup is extensions](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m55s)



[do is generate a resource dictionary if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h18m56s)



[you use these than yes they are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m00s)



[automatically calculated however I'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m01s)



[look a little later at rolling your own](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m04s)



[custom themes because that's what we're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m07s)



[going to need to do for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m09s)



[some of the other themes that are that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m11s)



[are in because this library has both a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m15s)



[let's jump back over here it has both a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m18s)



[color theme that it generates from a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m21s)



[resource dictionary as well as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m22s)



[generating a theming code and so if you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m24s)



[want to go through and take full control](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m27s)



[of it and set all of the colors you can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m29s)



[do that but if you take full control and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m32s)



[set all the colors you're now in full](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m35s)



[control and you have to set all the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m37s)



[colors so or at least most of them](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m38s)



[okay so we'll go through we'll take care](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m42s)



[of that and switch that guy out cool so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m44s)



[I think that is everything we need from](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m51s)



[our app dot sam'l except for I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m53s)



[sure all of these brushes go away too](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h19m55s)



[because these we don't need the mark-up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m01s)



[extensions should just handle those for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m04s)



[us because these I believe are all just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m06s)



[the ma apps color theme brushes looks](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m09s)



[like it cool so what we had to do here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m13s)



[we're now down to just one line of code](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m16s)



[I like better okay so back over here so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m19s)



[now we need to actually go through and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m24s)



[pull off all of these and I am going to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m26s)



[cheat slightly and look at some code](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m28s)



[that I wrote previously because I can't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m30s)



[promise myself that I was going to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m32s)



[remember all of this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m33s)



[so I cheated and wrote some of it ahead](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m34s)



[of time because unfortunately memorizing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m37s)



[API is it's not quite what I do so we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m41s)



[are going to just I think I'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m48s)



[grab this whole block of code and bring](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m50s)



[this in and yeah so all of this code](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m53s)



[here oh not what I want to do too much](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h20m59s)



[time in vs code wrong keyboard shortcut](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m03s)



[okay okay so here we are pulling this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m06s)



[guy in and theme create so I need a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m13s)



[different this is resolving to the wrong](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m17s)



[theme let me grab because this really](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m19s)



[should be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m22s)



[using or I'm sorry using theme is going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m25s)



[to be I promise I really do know how to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m30s)



[type it's just hard to tell with how](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m36s)



[poorly I'm doing right now should be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m38s)



[that theme object I just have to fully](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m42s)



[qualify this right now because this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m45s)



[project actually has a theme class and I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m47s)



[need it to not resolve to that right now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m50s)



[so we're gonna come down here and this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m52s)



[guy here is what are you doing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h21m55s)



[I might just exclude you from the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m00s)



[project real quick just to make you go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m02s)



[away](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m04s)



[I don't really want to think about what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m04s)



[you're resolving to perfect okay so in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m07s)



[the material design library there is a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m12s)



[new theme object itself and more](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m13s)



[importantly let's get rid of this bar](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m17s)



[and there is a convenient little static](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m19s)



[helper on it that takes in a base theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m23s)



[as well as a primary and secondary color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m25s)



[so if you were curious what that markup](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m29s)



[extension does when you call custom](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m32s)



[theme it really is just doing this it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m33s)



[passing in a base theme a primary color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m35s)



[and an accent color and then it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m38s)



[setting these you'll notice their static](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m40s)



[members on theme for getting both the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m42s)



[light and the dark theme classes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m45s)



[basically we've gone through and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m47s)



[codified up all of the theming brushes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m49s)



[so that now you can act on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m52s)



[strongly-typed](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m54s)



[objects without necessarily having to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m55s)



[guess at and remember the keys you'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h22m57s)



[notice that all of these things like so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m01s)



[primary mid is this color pair a color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m03s)



[pair class has a color and then an](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m06s)



[optional foreground color so if you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m10s)



[don't specify a foreground color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m12s)



[explicitly it will generate or I should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m14s)



[say it'll guess based upon the lightness](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m18s)



[of the color whether the foreground](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m20s)



[color should be either white or black](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m21s)



[so we'll take advantage of that later](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m23s)



[that's all this contrasting foreground](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m25s)



[color method does here and then let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m27s)



[see jump back back back back and too far](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m30s)



[and let's see here so if you want to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m35s)



[through and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m38s)



[actually generate up one of these themes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m39s)



[and then you decide you know I really](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m41s)



[don't like what you guys generated for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m43s)



[me for the the primary color for the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m44s)



[light and the dark you can just go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m47s)



[through and change these after the fact](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m49s)



[or just don't call this helper method so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m51s)



[when you call set primary color it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m55s)



[brings in a primary color and just calls](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h23m58s)



[lighten and darken on it effectively](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m00s)



[going one shade lighter or one shade](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m02s)



[darker again you are free to change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m04s)



[these or if this doesn't end up lining](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m05s)



[up with the spec very well please let us](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m09s)



[know which colors were passed in and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m11s)



[what they should have been and I'm happy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m13s)



[to take a look at it and try to adjust](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m15s)



[this to make it match the hard part is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m16s)



[we are especially with arbitrary colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m19s)



[some of the material design ones don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m21s)



[necessarily line up with this this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m24s)



[single shade lighter and darker](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m27s)



[different colors switch just a little](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m28s)



[bit and so it's hard with arbitrary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m31s)



[colors to make this work so this is sort](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m34s)



[of a best guess](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m36s)



[but the bundled themes should still line](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m37s)



[up pretty accurately with everything](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m40s)



[because on those we control all the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m42s)



[colors okay so that's that's basically](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m43s)



[all of that gut all that this does so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m48s)



[what this is doing is there is a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m51s)



[material design color enum and it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m54s)



[contains inu members for every color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h24m58s)



[that was defined in the library so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m01s)



[before all of these existed inside of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m04s)



[resource dictionaries and so now we have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m06s)



[basically the base color and then as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m09s)



[well as references to all of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m11s)



[individual brushes that were used](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m15s)



[typically five through nine hundred and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m16s)



[then accent color one two four and seven](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m19s)



[hundred you don't necessarily need to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m21s)



[worry too much about these exact values](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m23s)



[it's really just to try and make these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m25s)



[guys line up nicely but in our view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m28s)



[model to go through and generate out](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m30s)



[this list what we're doing is we're just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m32s)



[iterating over these new members and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m35s)



[then we are checking to see if there is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m38s)



[a corresponding accent value so you'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m40s)



[notice these guys in here and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m44s)



[somewhere in here you'll notice there's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m47s)



[for example deep](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m51s)



[orange and then deep orange accent so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m53s)



[all this is doing is iterating through](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m56s)



[this a new member saying okay do I have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h25m57s)



[a course does this member have a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m00s)



[corresponding member that ends an accent](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m01s)



[sort of a cheater way of doing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m04s)



[effectively oh thanks Magnus this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m07s)



[effectively a cheater way of going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m12s)



[through and checking to say hey does](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m13s)



[this particular color theme have an](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m17s)



[accent color defined and then it simply](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m18s)



[goes through and looks up the theme and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m21s)



[builds it out and then sets it into the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m25s)



[view model so this view model is what we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m28s)



[need to change out next I think once](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m30s)



[again I am going to somewhat cheat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m34s)



[because I wrote this ahead of time and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m36s)



[think I remember what I did okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m38s)



[rather than the theme object itself](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m43s)



[we're going to switch so in general I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m45s)



[usually prefer to you to act on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m47s)



[interface interfaces rather than](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m49s)



[concrete implementations so we're just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m52s)



[gonna flip these guys both over so that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m55s)



[theme class implements the eye theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m58s)



[interface this is a it's a fairly simple](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h26m59s)



[interface but it's basically just a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m04s)



[whole bunch of colors and color pairs](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m06s)



[and again color pair is just a color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m08s)



[with an optional foreground color to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m11s)



[with it again you'll notice all of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m15s)



[things are get set you're free to take](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m17s)



[one of these theme objects and tweak it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m19s)



[to make it match or persist and reload](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m21s)



[as much as as much as you need so and it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m24s)



[should should make it simple so this guy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m27s)



[here I did say I was going to change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m30s)



[this out to make it a little nicer so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m32s)



[rather than doing sample brush let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m34s)



[let's make it obvious that we're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m37s)



[changing it so let's go with sample](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m38s)



[color color and actually you know what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m40s)



[we probably don't even need to have this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m45s)



[property anymore do we yeah we could](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m48s)



[cheat we don't even necessarily well](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m54s)



[let's let's hide the implementation so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m55s)



[this guy is just going to become will go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h27m58s)



[with a lambda body member theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m01s)



[primary mid color so this guy is just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m06s)



[going to kick back the color and we'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m10s)



[deal with we'll deal with converting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m11s)



[that to a brush over in the view and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m16s)



[then here I think we're gonna switch](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m18s)



[this over and just do string name](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m20s)



[I think that's roughly what I had done](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m23s)



[before](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m25s)



[and then something like this so that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m26s)



[works there and we'll jump back to our](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m32s)



[main view model and this this should get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m36s)



[at least this much compiling so let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m39s)



[back up before we before we deal with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m43s)



[these guys I'm gonna just comment out](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m46s)



[these ones really quick so these are the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m48s)



[two custom themes that were being](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m51s)



[defined from code and from resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m53s)



[dictionaries but before we get to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m55s)



[dealing with those I want to deal with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m57s)



[sort of these other ones up here so this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h28m59s)



[idea of being able to toggle is light](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m01s)



[theme and is dark theme one thing I will](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m04s)



[mention if you start switching over to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m06s)



[this new API you need to switch all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m10s)



[your code over to this API you'll get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m13s)



[into very weird situations if you keep](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m15s)



[using the old obsolete methods with the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m17s)



[newer to 600 theming stuff so if you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m20s)



[start to do the switch do it all or do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m25s)



[none of it don't mix and match but for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m27s)



[this guy here the the easiest way and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m31s)



[this sort of starts to kind of highlight](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m36s)



[some of the basics of what is in this so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m38s)



[for starters we don't really want to use](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m43s)



[this pallet helper anymore because this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m46s)



[guy's whole point in life was to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m48s)



[basically wrap setting all these MA app](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m51s)



[brushes so I think what I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m53s)



[is I'm just going to drop him from the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m55s)



[project - let's bring him back and so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h29m59s)



[rather than the MA apps pallet helper we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m03s)



[will go back to just the the built in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m05s)



[pallet helper class so this is now the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m08s)



[one that is right inside material design](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m11s)



[themes the same one that most of you are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m14s)



[probably using](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m18s)



[it's just got some obsolete members now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m20s)



[so things like query palette set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m25s)



[light-dark set accent color set primary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m27s)



[color all of those are now effectively](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m32s)



[broken hey thanks for the follow bf](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m36s)



[ozone I think so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m40s)



[those accent colors are now or those](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m43s)



[methods are now obsolete in favor of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m47s)



[some of these other ones so effectively](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m48s)



[if you want to go through before there](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m51s)



[was a nice little just set light dark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m53s)



[that has been slightly changed and if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m55s)



[you want to wrap this in a similar](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h30m58s)



[helper method I never quite got around](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m00s)



[to it but you can pull out the current](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m03s)



[theme which is just going to give you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m08s)



[back one of those theme objects that you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m12s)



[can then act on and modify as you need](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m13s)



[to so then in this case we will do theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m15s)



[set base theme which you'll note this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m19s)



[an extension method on it and we will](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m22s)



[just do theme let's see here what do we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m25s)



[got coming in we've got a boolean coming](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m29s)



[in so if the value is true we'll do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m31s)



[theme dot light the value is false we'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m34s)



[do theme dark something like that and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m37s)



[then finally now that we've modified the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m44s)



[theme itself we just simply go palette](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m47s)



[helper set theme and these two methods](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m50s)



[are sort of the the key pieces that that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m54s)



[the whole new theming API is built](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h31m58s)



[around the idea of being able to query](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m00s)



[out your current theme which wasn't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m03s)



[necessarily easy to do before there was](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m05s)



[the query palette but then making](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m08s)



[modifications to that and reapplying](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m10s)



[that wasn't always as trivial as you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m12s)



[would hope so now you can pull the theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m14s)



[out again it's just that same bunch of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m18s)



[colors so that you can see all of your](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m21s)



[brushes that you might want to set and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m23s)



[then you can call set theme right back](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m24s)



[there are extension methods for the set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m28s)



[base theme set primary and secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m31s)



[which are just those fancy helpers for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m33s)



[automatically you know adjusting back](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m36s)



[and forth so this will toggle light and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m37s)



[dark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m40s)



[this guy here so let's see here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m42s)



[so when is set theme called so this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m46s)



[called when one of those buttons is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m49s)



[clicked so it calls in with the theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m51s)



[color view model which is the one that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m54s)



[we modified here that has a theme in a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m56s)



[name and so in this case this method](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h32m58s)



[just becomes palette helper set theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m02s)



[theme theme and this is only mostly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m06s)



[right so the the the problem here is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m13s)



[this theme object was created right here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m17s)



[and you'll notice it was always created](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m19s)



[with a light theme so we actually want](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m21s)



[to not just blindly set it and this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m24s)



[mostly this is a lesson artifact of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m27s)



[API and a little bit more of the way I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m29s)



[structured this app but we will do this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m32s)



[and I'm just going to cheat and grab](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m35s)



[this line right here let's the in view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m38s)



[model let's just disambiguate these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m46s)



[names since I'm reusing the word theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m50s)



[all over the place like that and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m52s)



[this becomes so if we're in the light](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h33m58s)



[theme we'll just toggle that and make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m02s)



[sure that this theme has the appropriate](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m04s)



[base to go along with it because really](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m06s)



[all we're looking to do is change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m08s)



[whatever is set for the primary accent](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m09s)



[colors and then we will just call set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m12s)



[theme which will adjust it well what are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m16s)



[you squawking about resharper you don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m20s)



[like my name Oh lower case him sure why](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m21s)



[not okay so this is this guy here this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m25s)



[comment is now highly misleading because](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m30s)



[this isn't easily an extension method](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m32s)



[and let's just comment these out and I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m34s)



[think we are close to running the last](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m37s)



[thing we need to do is we switched over](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m41s)



[so clean up those usings and I don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m46s)



[need my nougat window open anymore we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m48s)



[switched over the theme color view model](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m50s)



[to rather than having a brush in it to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m52s)



[just having the color all by itself so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m55s)



[we need to address that in our view so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h34m58s)



[this is I believe what you were driving](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m00s)



[at earlier tide so this binding here is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m03s)



[now going to go to sample color but](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m06s)



[color is not a brush so we need a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m10s)



[converter and aesthetic resource let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m13s)



[do something like solid brush converter](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m28s)



[which we need to create so let's just go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m31s)



[and spin that guy real quick so add new](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m35s)



[class solid brush converter so value](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m40s)



[converter don't implement interface](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m54s)



[thank you and I'm just going to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h35m57s)



[quickly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m02s)



[in reality you you should really type](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m05s)



[check your values and not just blindly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m10s)



[new solid let's say solid color brush](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m14s)



[and then if it i suppose if somebody](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m23s)



[wanted to use it on our two-way binding](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m27s)



[which we won't be at the moment but so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m30s)



[solid color brush and just grab the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m33s)



[color right back off of it yeah I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m37s)



[understand no reference exceptions](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m40s)



[possible we aren't going to stress about](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m41s)



[those because those shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m44s)



[possible and then we will just add this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m46s)



[converter at the top solid rush](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m49s)



[converter](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h36m54s)



[pick that guy up and now it should just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m01s)



[convert back and forth so this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m03s)



[basically the the short way how I would](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m05s)



[go around it most of the time tied is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m07s)



[having my view model just expose the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m09s)



[data and have it not know about the view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m11s)



[most of the time I try to make my view](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m15s)



[models as agnostic of the view as I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m19s)



[possibly can get them and secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m21s)



[color was not found although what did I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m30s)



[call it why are you so confused my apps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m32s)



[bundled theme bundled theme secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m42s)



[color like somebody just lost their mind](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m47s)



[let's rebuild this hub of the property](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h37m53s)



[secondary color was not found okay let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m05s)



[whack you real quick and just get you to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m07s)



[compile what is what is your problem](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m08s)



[this may be the fun of using a nougat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m11s)



[package that I just did the other night](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m14s)

[happened this guy updated oh but it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m36s)



[didn't generate it did not build new](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m42s)



[nougat packages out on nougat org that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m49s)



[is the problem okay so we're gonna work](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m53s)



[about go around this problem for the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m58s)



[moment so there is a let's see here let](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h38m59s)

[my screen over](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m09s)



[so just one second here real quick we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m11s)



[are going to switch so I can make sure](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m16s)



[I'm in the right](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m19s)



[DevOps instance so right now we have to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m20s)



[build systems that are running one on as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m23s)



[your DevOps and one on at their the plan](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m26s)



[is eventually to obsolete app they're in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m29s)



[favor of DevOps the problem is right now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m31s)



[app fare is still what's pushing out the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m36s)



[nougat packages to nougat org and I was](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m40s)



[running with packages that were built on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m46s)

[building all of the nougat packages](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m52s)



[whereas app there is only building](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m54s)



[material design in zamel the core](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h39m57s)



[library so let's switch back okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m00s)



[DevOps and I'm going to just cheat real](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m06s)



[quick so there is technically a quite a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m10s)



[few pipelines but what I am interested](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m15s)



[in is grabbing these builds which I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m18s)



[suspect will be the you know do not let](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m22s)

[to James to review the stuff so that we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h40m43s)

[you can always download them directly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m11s)



[the plan is to expose a better CI feed](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m14s)



[so that people can get these a lot](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m19s)



[better but again we're kind of in that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m22s)



[halfway point and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m23s)

[addressed on the 300 release is getting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m26s)



[these pipelines hammered out and running](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m27s)



[so let's see here I need to put these in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m30s)



[so I don't know how many people may have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m35s)



[seen these before but there is a place](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m38s)



[files in the definition so one of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m43s)



[things that you can do with nougat if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m46s)



[you get access to the the nougat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m47s)



[packages is I just have this folder](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h41m49s)

[reasons why switching over to the other](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h42m20s)



[build system is going to be hard we kind](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h42m23s)

[those in sync and go back and forth so I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h42m39s)



[kind of want to just do a whole package](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h42m43s)

[I pushed out Sunday and Monday night are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h42m54s)

[this new API so please don't grab those](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h42m59s)



[CI packages and try to use this you'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m02s)



[get the same air that I did because we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m04s)



[need to get out those API changes to the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m07s)

[about](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m23s)



[okay compile and run this should now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m33s)



[work like I said the other thing too is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m36s)



[if people are wanting these and you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m40s)



[don't see the nougat packages you can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m41s)



[just go out and download them and I have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m43s)



[clearly broken something my color theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m46s)

[did I do on my main window that caused](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h43m59s)



[all those to break so my items control](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m01s)



[that guy there](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m06s)

[theme colors add range theme colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m16s)

[did I do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m31s)



[let's take a look because all I change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m32s)



[was there and there that should build](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m38s)



[that should build set light dark get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m41s)



[primary theme you should be obsolete](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m45s)



[you should be obsolete that should not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m51s)



[be necessary so let's just relaunch this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h44m57s)



[guy real quick and I'm gonna fire up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m02s)



[snoop and we're gonna see what the heck](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m04s)



[is happening to my items control because](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m06s)



[it should be right there it's clearly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m08s)



[not it's bound there data type is set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m11s)



[this seems like the only way this should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m19s)



[happen is if I don't have any items in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m22s)



[my collection did I maybe I should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m27s)



[validate that those still line up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m31s)



[so let's see navigate in there and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m37s)



[the items control is gonna be right next](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m40s)



[door so switch](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m42s)



[there's my items control there's my](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m45s)



[items control axle height to zero which](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m48s)



[is why we're not seeing anything let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m50s)



[look at the data context theme colors is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m52s)



[a list and it has no items in it okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h45m56s)



[this would clearly be a problem let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m01s)



[see here you're telling me none of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m05s)



[matched](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m11s)



[oh let's see so tryparse go through](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m11s)



[select add range let's just rebuild this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m16s)



[guy real quick a little shocked given](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m21s)



[that I copied and pasted this code from](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m24s)



[something I wrote previously so seems a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m26s)



[little off so step over and theme colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m31s)



[count zero so let's let's go back my](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m37s)



[execution pointer up and let's rerun](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m42s)



[this and see what the heck is going on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m44s)



[set next statement ok and f11 so enum](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m48s)



[tryparse red is 50 don't expect don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m55s)



[expect 300 400 500 red really you new](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h46m59s)



[tryparse on all of those returned false](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m14s)



[what the heck this is red ah](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m20s)



[that's why because somebody renamed his](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m29s)



[Inu members right after dropping the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m32s)



[word accent from it because I was trying](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m35s)



[to standardize the API that's the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m39s)



[problem so we'll back up and try the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m42s)



[skin so again rather than the word](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m44s)



[accent the word secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m48s)



[for the what used to be accent colors at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m50s)



[least from what I saw on the new](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m53s)



[material design Docs this seemed to be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m55s)



[the naming scheme they were going with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h47m57s)



[though I still found a couple references](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m00s)



[to accent in a few places requested](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m01s)



[value uh and I broke the universe](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m05s)



[because one should always change all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m11s)



[their code yeah yeah yeah I hear ya I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m16s)



[hear ya](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m18s)



[switch over and paste there we are try](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m19s)



[this again so if you change the text in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m24s)



[one spot you should change it in the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m27s)



[other or perhaps this should be a tuple](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m28s)



[or something ah there we go okay so this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m40s)



[guy now comes through we can change our](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m45s)



[themes go through like dark pink lime](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m47s)



[more importantly you'll notice this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m55s)



[guy's toggling - I might double check my](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h48m57s)



[my apps brushes because it looks like](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m05s)



[whatever brush this guy is using I don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m07s)



[know if that's intentional there's that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m09s)



[stained blue or if it's not I think the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m11s)



[answer is not real quick while I'm in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m13s)



[here let me just look because there is a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m15s)



[chance that the my apps version I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m17s)



[using isn't compatible and if it is I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m19s)



[would like to know that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m22s)



[let's see dragging thumb let's see where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m24s)



[is that toggle switch button it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m28s)



[probably got the brush up here to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m32s)



[Maude's metro is it gonna be down a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m34s)



[little further so this is toggle switch](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m38s)



[on brush win 10 toggle switch button on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m44s)



[switch brush win 10 I'm gonna just make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m50s)



[a note of this brush to go and I don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h49m55s)



[know I want to copy that resource name](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m01s)



[prtscn it is I just want to make sure](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m03s)



[that I go back and check that brush](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m10s)



[because if there's another one that we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m11s)



[should be setting I would like to know](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m13s)



[it and get that adjusted because again](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m14s)



[the nice part is now I don't have to rev](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m17s)



[the entire library if I need to if I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m20s)



[need to change some of the my apps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m25s)



[integration I can just Rev that library](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m26s)



[by itself so going to ignore that for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m28s)



[now and let's go back and look at doing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m31s)



[the custom ones it would be good to use](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m36s)



[this app for the color picker testing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m40s)



[yeah I don't disagree tie-dye actually](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m41s)



[so my material design example repo one](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m44s)



[of the things that I did for the to 600](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m47s)



[release is I just updated every project](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m49s)



[I had admittedly they're all small](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m53s)



[projects with one or two things in them](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m55s)



[and then I just started running them all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m57s)



[to see if I saw any problems and so this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h50m59s)



[is one of the first ones I run to test](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m03s)



[the the theming stuff this and the two](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m05s)



[demo apps are usually the sum total of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m08s)



[my full testing because if I if I get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m11s)



[all of those working across the board](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m15s)



[I'm usually fairly confident we've](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m16s)



[covered everything and if there's a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m19s)



[control that we miss I try to get it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m21s)



[added to one of the projects okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m22s)



[back to the other thing so this is all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m26s)



[well and good as long as you're using](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m28s)



[the built-in color theme stuff but now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m29s)



[let's look at doing both generating](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m31s)



[color themes from resource dictionaries](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m35s)



[as well as from code so this app here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m37s)



[has this custom zamel theme and all it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m40s)



[does is declare a bunch of colors just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m43s)



[right here in line with each of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m47s)



[nothing fancy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m50s)



[these happen to match the material](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m52s)



[design brush names but that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m56s)



[coincidental you could theoretically](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h51m58s)



[name these however you want as you will](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m00s)



[see so let's take and pick on I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m03s)



[let's do the the code one first because](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m07s)



[I think that's that was probably the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m10s)



[simpler option so we will do generate](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m12s)



[theme from code](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m15s)



[bring that guy back and then let's see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m17s)



[generate theme from code so this was the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m20s)



[Fire and Ice theme the the blue and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m24s)



[orange as it were okay so this code is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m27s)



[all well and good we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m33s)



[comment it out so step one create a new](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m36s)



[theme so I think I'm just going to just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m39s)



[straight up new up a new theme object we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m42s)



[will then set the base theme and this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m46s)



[one isn't going to matter too much](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m51s)



[because ultimately these this theme here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m54s)



[the base theme is going to get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h52m59s)



[overwritten on the onset theme so we can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m01s)



[pass really anything we want here and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m04s)



[it's not going to really make a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m06s)



[difference just but the way this app is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m07s)



[set up so we'll just go with light](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m08s)



[because it doesn't matter and then we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m10s)



[want to go through and set the the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m13s)



[primary colors and the the secondary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m15s)



[colors to effectively match these ones](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m18s)



[here so you'll note the the light one](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m21s)



[which used to be primary 200 was salmon](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m25s)



[and then we went up to orange and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m28s)



[red with the what used to be called](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m29s)



[accent color being set to deep sky blue](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m32s)



[with a foreground color of green so once](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m36s)



[again I'm going to just cheat a little](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m39s)



[bit so I don't have to type all this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m41s)



[again and so these are just the standard](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m44s)



[WPF colors being brought in this this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m48s)



[demo app and currently nothing in the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m55s)



[material design library takes advantage](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h53m58s)



[of secondary light and dark they're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m00s)



[added to the theme API with the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m02s)



[assumption that we will take advantage](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m04s)



[of them in the future but they are there](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m06s)



[for your usage just know that none of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m09s)



[the built-in controls are taking](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m11s)



[advantage of these so for now we're just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m12s)



[setting all of them to the same color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m14s)



[okay and then finally we just kick back](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m17s)



[the theme done and again this is going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m22s)



[through and explicitly setting the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m27s)



[foreground color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m30s)



[if we wanted to we could omit these and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m31s)



[let it guess at the appropriate](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m34s)



[foreground color in fact let's do that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m37s)



[real quick again if you let it guess at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m40s)



[the foreground color it's only going to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m43s)



[pick white or black it's not going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m46s)



[there's no other ground it basically](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m48s)



[says is this a dark color okay I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m50s)



[pick light or I'm gonna pick white is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m52s)



[this a light color okay I'm gonna pick](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m54s)



[black and so especially colors where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m55s)



[that that white or black neither one of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h54m59s)



[them are great you may end up wanting to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m02s)



[explicitly set a foreground color for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m05s)



[them the built-in color themes those all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m08s)



[just work just fine use the additional](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m11s)



[secondary colors currently no tied the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m13s)



[only one that's being used by the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m16s)



[existing stuff is the secondary mid so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m17s)



[this is the only one that's currently in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m22s)



[use oh do any of the material design](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m23s)



[controls that is a good question so the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m29s)



[spec itself even though it outlines the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m33s)



[controls isn't overly picky about](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m35s)



[defining controls and colors sort of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m38s)



[having styles that mix a particular to a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m42s)



[control is something that this library](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m46s)



[does just because it makes it easier on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m49s)



[the styles and doesn't force you to set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m52s)



[things repeatedly but the the spec](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m54s)



[really just sort of outlines here's the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h55m58s)



[colors and here's what each color means](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m00s)



[use it appropriately oh and here's a set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m02s)



[of controls and so mix and match where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m05s)



[it makes sense so they define the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m07s)



[concept of secondary mid light and dark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m10s)



[but they and sort of when those would](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m13s)



[get used but there's not really a a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m16s)



[concept of mixing the the controls and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m19s)



[the colors together in the spec it is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m21s)



[the the material design spec is more of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m24s)



[here's how you should lay things out and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m27s)



[here's how what things mean and what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m30s)



[users are going to expect put them](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m31s)



[together in the right way which is both](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m34s)



[good and bad so it gives a lot of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m37s)



[freedom because part of what they've](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m38s)



[done with it is the initially it was](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m40s)



[just Android](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m44s)



[but now you've got things like](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m45s)



[Chromebooks where you're starting to see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m47s)



[these apps come across and material](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m50s)



[design getting used in web pages and so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m52s)



[it's not just for mobile it's trying to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m54s)



[be an entire design framework if that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h56m57s)



[all makes sense okay so this is all it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m02s)



[takes if you want to go through and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m06s)



[create up a theme in code so if you want](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m07s)



[it yeah or Windows apps exactly so if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m10s)



[you want to go through and build out](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m13s)



[some means of serializing your theme and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m15s)



[reloading it or just building out your](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m18s)



[own custom stuff in code behind it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m21s)



[shouldn't be any harder than this you do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m24s)



[need to make sure that you do set all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m27s)



[the brushes on your theme and it can be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m29s)



[as simple as simply calling theme set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m32s)



[base set primary set secondary if you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m35s)



[call all three of those that'll have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m39s)



[everything set and you'll be done](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m41s)



[because there are there are quite a few](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m44s)



[brushes on this theme object but the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m46s)



[idea being that by codifying all of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m48s)



[brushes it now means if and when we make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m52s)



[any breaking color or brush changes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m55s)



[you'll get compile errors and not just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h57m58s)



[missing resources and having to track](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m01s)



[those down anymore which i think is much](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m03s)



[nicer okay so let's do the one from the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m06s)



[resource dictionary as well so before](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m08s)



[what this guy was doing is it was just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m11s)



[calling into the resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m14s)



[okay fine load reference let's go be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m16s)



[happy singing stop whining at me is it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m19s)



[was just calling into the resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m21s)



[dictionary and looking up those colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m23s)



[based on their keys so again when I said](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m25s)



[that these names just happen to match](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m28s)



[the material design theme it really is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m29s)



[this for this this could be my hue color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m32s)



[one my hue color two if you wanted the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m35s)



[the key part is these keys just have to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m38s)



[match the keys from the from the zamel](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m41s)



[dictionary so if we wanted to go through](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m43s)



[and change these guys out all we got to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m47s)



[do is a couple quick switches so once](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m50s)



[again I'm going to just comment this guy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m53s)



[out because](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m56s)



[he's a little meaningless and we're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h58m57s)



[gonna start same same thing here we're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m00s)



[gonna set a base theme just so that I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m04s)



[know that all my brushes are set but](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m06s)



[again this this set is pretty](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m08s)



[meaningless because it's going to get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m10s)



[overridden here before this theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m11s)



[actually get applies it gets applied to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m13s)



[anything and then let's just I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m16s)



[once again just cheat and grab my little](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m21s)



[code snippet ahead of time so same type](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m25s)



[of thing as before it just pulls out the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m28s)



[color pair and looks up the color from](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m31s)



[the resource dictionary pulls it out and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m33s)



[sends it back so nothing nothing too](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m37s)



[fancy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m42s)



[rather than name I think we're gonna](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m44s)



[change this up to be key because name](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m46s)



[was the name of the theme not the name](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m51s)



[of the color so that was a wee bit](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m53s)



[misleading in the previous code and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m55s)



[the last thing returned theme okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=00h59m59s)



[this guy the name no longer goes here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m06s)



[and actually I'm gonna make these guys](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m11s)



[return I themes just so that just to be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m14s)



[a little nicer because there's no reason](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m17s)



[to make this API strongly coupled to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m19s)



[that particular object okay and so this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m23s)



[guy here loads up the resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m27s)



[dictionary and then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m30s)



[this guy where we go control you let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m34s)



[see you get theme from resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m38s)



[dictionary and there we go so we've got](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m39s)



[our jungle green theme here that it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m42s)



[going to pull out of that let's fire](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m46s)



[this guy up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h00m49s)



[and hopefully this guy go go go go go go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m03s)



[and now we should have two extra options](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m15s)



[in our list of color themes that we can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m18s)



[just toggle between so make this window](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m20s)



[a little bigger so I can see everything](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m24s)



[so if I go with my fire and ice' option](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m26s)



[I now have those colors if we go dark I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m29s)



[think it's a little more obvious to see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m34s)



[if I go jungle I now have my jungle](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m36s)



[themed ones as well you can see those](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m40s)



[switched all over and that's all there](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m43s)



[is to it really everything in this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m48s)



[theming API I think boils down to using](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m53s)



[the new get set theme on the palette](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m56s)



[helper and if you want to go even more](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h01m59s)



[low-level than that on the resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m02s)



[dictionary itself most of the calls](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m05s)



[ultimately boil down to resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m09s)



[dictionary set theme which this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m12s)



[extension method just shells out](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m17s)



[go-go-go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m19s)



[shells out to a resource dictionary it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m24s)



[takes in a theme object and this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m26s)



[somewhat ugly to look at but all it does](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m28s)



[is go through it go through and set all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m30s)



[of those brushes from the theme into the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m33s)



[resource dictionary and that's it Magnus](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m36s)



[oh I know I saw you in the the chat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m42s)



[earlier is is that helpful I know you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m44s)



[were you were asking for a blog post on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m45s)



[this and I think I may still end up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m47s)



[writing one just so that there's a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m49s)



[little bit more thorough documentation](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m51s)



[but I figured I at least wanted to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m52s)



[through this to just show off what I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m55s)



[what I think as a cleaner API I hope so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h02m57s)



[I'm hoping this is easier for everybody](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m01s)



[one other thing I don't think I I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m04s)



[mentioned I think I implied so there's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m06s)



[my apps bundled theme Oh awesome and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m08s)



[then there there is also the MA apps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m11s)



[what is it a custom color theme so if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m14s)



[you want to go through and change up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m19s)



[rather than using the built-in ones so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m21s)



[so primary you know](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m24s)



[aqua secondary we'll just make this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m28s)



[really obvious I don't know](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m34s)



[red so you can go through and do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m37s)



[something like this both of these guys](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m40s)



[just arrived from the material design](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m42s)



[markup extension the one thing that it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m45s)



[does do is it gives you a nice injection](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m48s)



[point to be able to hijack it so I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m51s)



[I'll walk through that real quick as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m53s)



[well so in addition to this I theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m55s)



[interface subtly hidden under the covers](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h03m57s)



[is also a theme manager so if you have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h04m00s)



[something in your app where you want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h04m03s)



[do stuff when the theme changes there is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h04m05s)



[an event that gets raised that you can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h04m09s)



[tie into and watch to effectively make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h04m11s)



[additional changes so there we go so awk](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h04m14s)

[to it if you want it but it's I'm not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m12s)



[100% sure on it yet which is why it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m15s)



[hasn't migrated throughout so if you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m18s)



[were to look on let's see app current](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m21s)

[little more obvious base class great](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m44s)



[this theme manager class itself just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m47s)



[contains a single event for theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m53s)

[so we'll just register up on this guy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m55s)



[and great method so if you want to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h05m57s)



[through and do something the event args](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m03s)



[that come through on this guy have both](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m06s)



[the old theme the new theme as well and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m08s)



[the resource dictionary that it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m10s)



[getting applied to because all of this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m11s)



[theming stuff especially inside of WPF](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m13s)



[themes are implicitly hierarchical](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m16s)



[hierarchical I haven't had enough](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m22s)



[caffeine I can't talk tonight in that if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m25s)



[you apply these theme resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m28s)



[dictionaries at a lower level that will](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m31s)



[override something that was set say in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m34s)



[your app dog zamel or window dot sam'l](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m35s)



[which is why this thing also comes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m39s)



[through with the resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m41s)



[where those were applied at the the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m44s)



[thing to note is this theme manager is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m48s)



[also per resource dictionaries so when](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m50s)



[you do the the new set theme methods on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m53s)



[like the palette helper so when you call](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h06m57s)



[palette helper set theme one of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m01s)



[things that does at the very end of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m03s)



[method and I should probably stop](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m05s)



[looking at so you'll notice this is just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m06s)



[application current resources set theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m08s)



[come on all the way in the last thing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m10s)



[that this method does dududududududududu](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m13s)



[this is horrible to look at let's look](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m16s)



[at the real code bring this over real](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m19s)



[quick is it goes through and sets a it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m22s)



[sets up the theme manager so that it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m26s)



[exists but that theme manager only](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m28s)



[exists at that resource dictionary so if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m30s)



[you wire up on this event on the theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m32s)



[manager that is at the root so your app](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m34s)



[dot sam'l so resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m39s)



[extensions you will not get events if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m41s)



[somebody changed it only at a lower](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m44s)



[level there's not a great way of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m46s)



[handling that at the moment so there's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m49s)



[there's an outstanding feature that I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m52s)



[know Roberts](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m54s)



[knife was looking at implementing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m56s)



[potentially for routed events which then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h07m58s)



[would give you a means of hijacking it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m02s)



[so when you call set theme at the very](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m05s)



[end it checks your resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m08s)



[to see if there's a theme manager if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m09s)



[there's not it creates a new one for you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m11s)



[and sets it in and then calls on theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m14s)



[change just notifying you that hey by](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m16s)



[the way the theme has changed this theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m19s)



[manager is how the mah app stuff is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m22s)



[ultimately working so if we look at our](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m25s)



[custom color theme this guy here is just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m29s)



[wiring up on that theme changed event](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m34s)



[and so when the theme changes it goes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m36s)



[through and applies all of the MA](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m39s)



[apps brushes to that resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m42s)



[and just builds it out and this set my](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m44s)



[apps extension method is effectively](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m46s)



[what that other one was before setting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m48s)



[up all of those brushes to make sure](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m51s)



[that those line up correctly so if in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m54s)



[the event that there is something that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m58s)



[you want to do and you want to get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h08m59s)



[access to those theme changed events](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m01s)



[again most of the time what you're](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m03s)



[probably looking to do is grab it off of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m06s)



[your application level resources since I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m08s)



[think most of the time this is where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m12s)



[people are probably changing their theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m13s)



[again your app made you something](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m14s)



[different I've heard of people who have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m17s)



[different themes per window or whatnot](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m18s)



[but you can grab the theme manager for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m21s)



[that appropriate level to be able to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m24s)



[pull it through and I think that that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m25s)



[probably covers all of the the theming](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m31s)



[API that I was gonna look at tonight](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m33s)



[does anyone have any questions on this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m36s)



[or is there anything else](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m38s)



[Femi related that people are hoping to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m39s)



[see or wanting to see this actually](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m42s)



[ended up going a lot quicker than I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m50s)



[expected normally I type a lot slower](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m51s)



[than this at least when people are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m54s)



[looking at me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h09m57s)



[no questions Wow I'm either good at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m00s)



[explaining this or it's as clear as mud](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m04s)



[so I'm gonna go with hopefully this all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m06s)



[makes sense in here so with that said](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m10s)



[probably go through and start looking at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m15s)



[a few other things so I think one of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m17s)



[things I wanted to take a quick peek at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m23s)



[was this this MA apps brush thing to see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m25s)



[if there was something else that needed](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m28s)



[to be fixed on this so people want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m29s)



[hang around I may just see about sniping](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m33s)



[this bug real quick there was up here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m36s)



[and I think there may have this may have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m40s)



[been somewhat the crux of the problem](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m42s)



[these brushes here I don't know if these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m46s)



[got migrated into the MA apps helper](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m49s)



[this might be the I suspect the crux of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h10m55s)



[the problem so let's let's just jump](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m00s)



[into the library and start looking at](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m02s)



[these because that that would be one one](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m07s)



[nice thing to go through and fix as well](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m08s)



[real quick and I think we so the the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m10s)



[mixing of these cans still work when the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m17s)



[theme gets applied in did you jump back](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m21s)



[over here so when we apply a and call](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m24s)



[this set call a solid color brush let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m29s)



[just jump down to set solid color brush](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m33s)



[it does two things so in addition to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m36s)



[setting the brush with the name it'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m41s)



[also add brush with color suffix on the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m44s)



[end and embed the color name as well as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m48s)



[as a resource so if you want to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m50s)



[through and reference just the colors by](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m56s)



[themselves say your wreath II mean a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h11m58s)



[another third-party library and you need](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m01s)



[access to the colors and not necessarily](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m05s)



[the direct brushes you can get access to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m07s)



[them this way as well again this does](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m09s)



[assume that you're calling the new API](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m11s)



[and you're not using](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m13s)



[the old straight-up resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m14s)



[dictionaries let's clobber that real](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m15s)



[quick and where'd you go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m19s)



[Jill studio you are somewhere off in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m21s)



[la-la land](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m26s)



[well monitor you opening on oh it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m29s)



[right in front of me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m31s)



[perfect so MA apps dragonballs demo so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m32s)



[this is the other app tight I don't know](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m36s)



[if you've seen this one also has a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m38s)



[similar color picker set up on it and it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m41s)



[looks like this is probably the problem](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m46s)



[is this guy only had a subset of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m50s)



[brushes whereas mine had all of them I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m53s)



[don't know why I did not notice this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h12m57s)



[before so that is probably the issue so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m00s)



[well let's jump over to this guy here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m03s)



[and let's just close out everything way](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m09s)



[too many tabs open way too many tabs](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m14s)



[open and I think all we need to do is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m16s)



[get all of these brushes set up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m21s)



[appropriately and then get a new set of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m23s)



[nougat packages built and then the world](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m26s)



[should be a happy place come on come on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m31s)



[resharper has to probably go and grep](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m36s)



[everything i](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m40s)



[forgot to turn off my notifications go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m47s)



[away stop helping me focus assist thank](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m51s)



[you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m56s)



[okay so we'll pick this up and I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h13m59s)



[then the question is just which of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m02s)



[got omitted so let's just copy this set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m05s)



[of brushes and then we'll bring these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m08s)



[over and make sure we cover these cases](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m11s)



[because I would hate I would hate to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m13s)



[break mops partly because one of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m15s)



[apps that I work on at work leverages it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m18s)



[and so I have a vested interest in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m21s)



[making sure I don't just hose it okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m24s)



[we'll just bring these guys in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m32s)



[great perfect so highlight brush cover](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h14m34s)

[accent color brush great great](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h15m00s)

[done checkmark fill primary five hundred](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h15m45s)



[and that should be primary mid](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h15m55s)



[okay right arrow fill mid right cuz](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m01s)

[finding several bugs in here awesome](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m20s)



[okay ideal foreground color brush](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m24s)



[primary mid and then it grabs the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m29s)



[foreground color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m34s)



[so this get foreground color all this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m35s)



[does on a color pair will either return](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m37s)



[the the foreground color that was set or](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m41s)



[do the the lookup to determine if it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m44s)



[should be white or black so it's just a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m46s)



[convenience method on there so ideal](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m49s)



[foreground color should be mid ideal](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m52s)



[disabled brush that has no pasty oh set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h16m56s)

[aren't we using this accent brush to 0.8](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m05s)



[and I'm guessing editing yeah I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m12s)



[you are right I that is exactly where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m19s)



[I'm where I was landing I'm not sure why](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m22s)



[this one was point eight and the other](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m25s)



[one was point two I'm seriously doubting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m26s)



[that 2/100 on the opacity is probably](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m31s)



[even visible there's a certain point](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m35s)



[where your I just can't usually detect](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m38s)



[it maybe it's my old eyes that are are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m40s)



[not good at this and my glasses so let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m43s)



[see and this is primary mid and okay so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m49s)



[I'm gonna apologize to anybody who is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m56s)



[using these this new API on my ops](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h17m58s)



[because clearly I had several of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m00s)



[brushes that were wrong okay so this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m02s)



[where we start getting into the area](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m06s)



[that wasn't covered before is all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m07s)



[these because the data](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m12s)



[brushes weren't added and the MA](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m13s)



[apps toggle switch brushes were not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m16s)



[added okay and I might I might even go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m20s)



[pull up the MA apps code real quick and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m25s)



[just check it because I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m29s)



[there are new brushes in there sort of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m31s)



[the the nice cheater approaches I can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m35s)



[update to match their update cadence now](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m37s)



[and so in theory I should be able to get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m41s)



[all of this going so let's see highlight](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m44s)



[brush should be primary mid I believe](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m48s)



[let's see mid color cool that does that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h18m55s)



[let's see here let's do because I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m04s)



[I want these grouped that just makes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m07s)



[sense highlight text color let's see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m10s)



[primary mid get foreground color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m16s)



[there was no pasty on that guy shouldn't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m21s)



[be any on this guy that's a copy and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m24s)



[paste air or editor inheritance as I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m27s)



[commonly like to call it let's see here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m31s)



[so mouse over highlight brush and that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m34s)



[a primary light color focus we can walk](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m38s)



[this guy know this is a primary mid and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m52s)



[that goes away and this is also making](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h19m58s)



[me wonder if I need to be adding data](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m03s)



[grids to these demo apps because I know](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m05s)



[I've got toggle switches in there which](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m10s)



[is what I was using for that toggle](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m12s)



[light dark but the fact that the fact](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m14s)



[that we missed all these brushes makes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m22s)



[me think that we need data grid to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m24s)



[ensure that I catch those so if somebody](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m27s)



[wants to add that to this my apps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m31s)



[draggable demo that would be great I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m33s)



[don't think there's anything in there](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m36s)



[that does it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m38s)



[let's see primary mid get foreground](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m39s)



[color and that'll clear up the two data](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m44s)



[grids and then we will do the toggle](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m47s)



[brushes there this this should be better](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m50s)



[I might just replace this dll on my demo](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h20m55s)



[app and make sure that this guy switches](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m03s)



[over appropriately primary mid color and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m04s)



[there there is a reason that this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m12s)



[foreground color is a method and not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m13s)



[just a property aside from the fact that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m15s)



[foreground color exists as a property](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m17s)



[here this contrasting foreground color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m19s)



[can be mildly expensive I mean it's just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m22s)



[some math but it is like even on the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m26s)



[color picker tie-dye I think you've](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m30s)



[noticed this the the delay and having to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m32s)



[calculate the HSV colour transformations](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m35s)



[isn't something you necessarily wanted](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m41s)



[to be doing say several times a second](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m43s)



[like in the order of a few dozen it gets](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m47s)



[it gets a little laggy so that is one of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m49s)



[the things that I'm hoping to take a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m53s)



[look at in 302 is to try and get that to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m55s)



[the point where the performance doesn't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h21m57s)



[add doesn't slow it down and we don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m01s)



[need to have a delay on the binding](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m04s)



[which would be nice there's a couple](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m05s)



[kind of performance things that I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m09s)



[hoping to squeeze into three oh the big](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m10s)



[thing is probably going to be dotnet v](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m13s)



[or dotnet core 300 depending on which](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m17s)



[version name you've heard support for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m20s)



[that C primary five foreground get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m23s)



[foreground color okay that should say](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m27s)



[all the brothers that's probably going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m30s)



[to be the big feature and I'm planning](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m31s)



[on revving the the core package version](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m33s)



[to 3.0 at the same time](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m37s)



[and then also cleaning up a bunch of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m40s)



[obsolete and making several breaking](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m44s)



[changes for those who are interested and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m46s)



[I will point this issue out because I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m49s)



[would like I would like feedback from](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m51s)



[people I haven't posted or made a big](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m53s)



[fuss about it yet because it's still a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m56s)



[ways out but if there are breaking level](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h22m59s)



[changes or other issues people want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m01s)



[link to for stuff to change please](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m04s)



[comment on here and these breaking three](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m08s)



[OH changes so there are several things](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m10s)



[that have been kind of common pain](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m12s)



[points like the card defaulting its](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m15s)



[vertical alignment to top that's bitten](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m17s)



[a lot of people when they when it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m19s)



[doesn't resize like you would expect it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m21s)



[to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m23s)



[because in WPF the default vertical](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m23s)



[alignment is stretch this one changes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m26s)



[that default it's confusing so but](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m28s)



[unfortunately to change that default is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m32s)



[a breaking change so a lot of those](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m33s)



[breaking changes I'm looking to document](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m36s)



[here and get lined up this was another](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m40s)



[one that somebody pointed out that was](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m42s)



[absolutely perfect how our vertical](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m44s)



[alignments aren't even close to lining](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m47s)



[up and these all should be I wanted to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m50s)



[go through and look at this a little](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m53s)



[closer I think they should all default](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m54s)



[to center or the because that's somewhat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h23m57s)



[the the problem here is I wasn't sure](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m02s)



[whether it was just the vertical](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m04s)



[alignment or if it was the vertical](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m05s)



[content alignment inside of those that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m07s)



[was getting each of these off](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m09s)



[regardless it's clearly a problem I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m11s)



[think the only question is what is the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m14s)



[correct fix and so I was gonna take a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m16s)



[quick peek at that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m19s)



[I think the vertical alignment all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m20s)



[these should be stretch and I think the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m22s)



[vertical content alignment should](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m24s)



[probably be centered but I wanted to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m26s)



[look specifically the text box that may](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m28s)



[not work for due to our underlying](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m30s)



[control and these things may need to all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m32s)



[just default their their vertical](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m35s)



[content alignment to bottom which I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m38s)



[think as long as they all line up that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m40s)



[the big thing because I've run into this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m42s)



[before when you're building a form and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m45s)



[stuff just doesn't line up and you end](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m47s)



[up starting to tweak those properties](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m49s)



[and I think by default they should line](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m50s)



[up unless](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m52s)



[changed something so I was gonna gonna](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m54s)



[look at that if anyone else wants to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h24m57s)

[we were just getting that that blue and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m23s)



[I think this will address that I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m26s)



[thinking I probably forgot to comment](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m28s)



[out these brushes when I was working on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m31s)



[this the other night which is probably](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m34s)



[why it looked to me like it was working](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m35s)



[because these resources would have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m39s)



[gotten set which unfortunately gave me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m42s)



[false confidence just not good not good](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m47s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m53s)



[it's only ten-thirty a little more](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m55s)



[caffeine a little more Kennington Oh](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h26m59s)



[Mountain Dew the sweet nectar of life](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m07s)



[okay did you finish great rebuild](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m12s)



[successful and let's go into here and I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m15s)



[think I just whacked the nougat package](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m19s)



[and do a straight-up project reference](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m23s)



[instead so yeah you go away yep thank](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m27s)



[you and remove that NuGet package for me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m34s)



[and that'll get closed and let's go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m41s)



[through and references just add](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m46s)



[reference and we're just going to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m53s)



[straight to the DLL brows huh material](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h27m54s)



[design toolkit and mops Ben debug and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m01s)



[okay great](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m10s)



[and hopefully just do a rebuild to make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m17s)



[sure that it wipes out that old](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m22s)



[reference and puts the new one in its](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m25s)



[place because I don't always trust the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m26s)



[the versioning on it Visual Studio does](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m33s)



[a pretty good job of knowing when things](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m36s)



[need to be updated but there are times](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m38s)



[it misses so sometimes that clean and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m42s)



[rebuild is at minimum just for my own](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m46s)



[good peace of mind hey that looks](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m49s)



[promising that's what I'm talking about](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m52s)



[that toggle switch now changes so that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m55s)



[what we were missing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m57s)



[that is what we were missing that little](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h28m59s)



[toggle switch one okay while we're on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m04s)



[the topic of my apps brushes let's go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m06s)



[jump real quick over at my apps and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m10s)



[let's go look because I'm curious I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m16s)



[realize I'm gonna be looking at their](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m19s)



[their latest - OH](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m20s)



[stuff but I am I am curious as to what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m22s)



[brushes are being defined over here okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m26s)



[so mops metro and as you can tell I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m33s)



[don't necessarily play in this one too](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m44s)



[much so I'm sort of gonna fumble my way](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m49s)



[around for a moment oh you know what we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m52s)



[can do you know what we can do we can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m57s)



[just as ultimately this is what I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h29m59s)



[looking for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m02s)



[let's just find this guy in the source I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m02s)



[think I dropped the M yeah let's just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m08s)



[find this guy and see where he lives](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m11s)



[cuz I can't imagine yeah so Styles theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m13s)



[theme template perfect this is what](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m19s)



[we're looking for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m26s)



[ah so he's got something fancy I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m27s)



[have to look at how he's doing this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m33s)



[so he's embedding string resources for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m36s)



[the name and the display name that is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m38s)



[one thing that I did not add in this to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m40s)



[six-oh release and I'm curious if people](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m43s)



[have an opinion if it matters if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m45s)



[embedding the name of the theme inside](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m47s)



[of it is useful the though so I can see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m49s)



[how how it would be helpful to be able](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m54s)



[to query that out of the resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m55s)



[dictionary the only thing that always](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m57s)



[got me is you're always in control of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h30m59s)



[what theme is being set so you could](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m03s)



[always track it and add it so if people](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m05s)



[are interested the other thing is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m13s)



[because it just accepts an IEEE theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m15s)



[interface you could always derive from](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m16s)



[that and add your own name property and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m20s)



[then register up on that theme manager](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m22s)



[event and again handle it I don't know](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m24s)



[I'm I'm torn some people like this and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m28s)



[I'm guessing he probably has a nice](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m31s)



[honesty manager a nice way of querying](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m33s)



[all this stuff out so it does look nice](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m36s)



[okay so these are all his colors I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m40s)



[more interested in the brushes universal](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m44s)



[control brushes ooh](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m48s)



[so these have changed a bit there are a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m49s)



[lot of brushes in here control](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m53s)



[validation brushes WPF default brushes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h31m56s)



[so these ones I'm less concerned with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m01s)



[looks like I could prob well shoot some](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m08s)



[of these whoo](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m11s)



[so I might need to go through and check](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m14s)



[these and see so at minimum these guys](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m16s)



[have been significantly expanded let's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m21s)



[let's take a look at the history on this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m27s)



[file real quick I'm curious how I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m28s)



[wondering how much of this is coming](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m32s)



[from his new - OH stuff](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m34s)



[for step four generated themes Oh](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m40s)



[Sebastian Schmitt was the one who](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m43s)



[started this work cool cool cool cool it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m46s)



[looks like he probably started it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m51s)



[similar time as we did we ended up at a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m52s)



[slightly different solution got it so he](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h32m56s)



[basically templated out all of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m00s)



[things and I'm guessing they've got](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m03s)



[something that goes through and just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m06s)



[does a magical string replace on all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m08s)



[these guys so if that's the case I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m10s)



[wonder if we could cheat and leverage](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m16s)



[this because it looks like there's only](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m19s)



[a fixed number of variables on this guy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m22s)



[and I'm wondering if we just set the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m26s)



[appropriate variables then I don't have](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m28s)



[to worry about the exact brushes that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m30s)



[might be cleaner the only part they and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m35s)



[so we wouldn't necessarily be overriding](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m39s)



[these brushes but maybe that's okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m42s)



[might be okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m49s)



[because they're steaming clearly doesn't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m55s)



[override these directly unless they've](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h33m58s)



[got something extra in okay I can get on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m00s)



[boy with that let's look at what else is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m06s)



[in here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m07s)



[generator parameters so I'm curious when](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m08s)



[this thing runs so this is the dark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m13s)



[theme because this is the other thing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m17s)



[that's a little a little weird is we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m19s)



[don't necessarily need to override all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m22s)



[their themes some of them it's important](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m24s)



[to do so other ones it really doesn't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m28s)



[matter so this is dark light and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m31s)



[these are the color schemes of changing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m36s)



[them so it must something must just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m39s)



[ingest this guy and do a set of all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m41s)



[these things cuz for the most part we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m47s)



[don't care too much about all the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m55s)



[brushes now I'm no I'm not I'm really](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h34m58s)



[curious as to how this thing's working](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m03s)



[okay so let's back up there's the steam](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m04s)



[generator what how do you work kind of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m07s)



[curious to go and look at this commit](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m13s)



[the initial one first step and generated](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m15s)



[themes so what else did you add in here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m18s)



[so let's see build props sure great](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m21s)



[great zamel color scheme generator so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m25s)



[this is a nougat package huh yeah the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m31s)



[the my app stuff does Rev pretty quick](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m36s)



[so one and Bastian do quite a bit on it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m39s)



[they also Bastian smitten works on the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m44s)



[control ZX library which if you've](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m48s)



[looked around in our packet files you'll](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m52s)



[notice we actually reference it as well](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m56s)



[ah this library okay so this is this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h35m58s)



[bastions zamel color scheme generator](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m04s)



[haha well we place in certain parts of a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m08s)



[temple I see the generator input and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m10s)



[template files so this is how this guy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m13s)



[is working ah interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m18s)



[interesting interesting okay I want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m23s)



[see this guy here because this is kind](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m28s)



[of clever I might need this for another](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m30s)



[project where I was doing some](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m32s)



[generation on zamel files so he is using](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m33s)



[it for his fluent ribbon got it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m38s)



[so template files default values base](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m44s)



[colors and clearly that's changed since](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m48s)



[the readme interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m53s)



[interesting okay this is worthy of a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m57s)



[star I'm gonna I'm gonna keep this as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h36m59s)



[one of those libraries I like to keep in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m02s)



[your back pocket just to see and does it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m04s)



[kick off from see what the build script](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m07s)



[does target build and this configure](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m12s)



[pre-release not a lot not a lot of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m17s)



[fanciness tools version this looks like](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m24s)



[an old msbuild powershell script not too](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m31s)



[interesting show me the app there so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m35s)



[nothing fancy literally just calls build](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m38s)



[for CI builds it out and away you go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m42s)



[okay so not not overly fancy ad strong](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m48s)



[name disassembly builds that out it's on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h37m55s)



[JSON and the tools scene generator so it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m03s)



[looks like this is actually something](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m10s)



[that could go as a dotnet global tool](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m11s)



[doesn't look like that's what it is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m16s)



[right now because it's generating out](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m18s)



[but it seems like it's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m20s)



[just built as a straight-up executable](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m22s)



[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m29s)



[sorry Ted I just saw your message this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m30s)



[guy here interesting okay so it builds](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m35s)



[this out grabs a mutex lock on the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m43s)



[individual file ooh interesting looks](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m47s)



[like it's using the grid to identify](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h38m59s)



[current any version of his assembly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m01s)



[that's locked on it and blocks so that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m03s)



[this guy can basically be tied in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m11s)



[because you you sometimes run into this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m13s)



[case where you get multiple processes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m15s)



[loading up your project specifically if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m17s)



[you've got like some sort of live unit](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m22s)



[testing or and crunch those type of ones](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m24s)



[that that may kick off or multiple](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m27s)



[msbuild processes so dealing with that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m29s)



[d5 hash so this isn't this is basically](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m33s)



[just shelling out to the color scheme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m37s)



[generator and this guy is the one that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m39s)



[actually does all the work](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m42s)



[so reads in the input file DC realizes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m43s)



[the JSON out color scheme base colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m46s)



[color scheme double iterates over the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m49s)



[base and the color scheme colors](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m53s)



[generates the file generates it out okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m55s)



[so yeah really is just a fancy albeit](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h39m59s)



[very fancy find and replace on all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m05s)



[the colors oh gotta love those curly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m10s)



[braces inside of an interpolated string](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m14s)



[yeah this is one of the only times where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m18s)



[the c-sharp string interpolation gets](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m21s)



[really really ugly is when you need to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m24s)



[do like say double curly braces and you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m26s)



[need to escape those which itself is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m29s)



[another curly brace so you just get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m31s)



[curly braces BAM](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m33s)



[all the way across so nice and clean](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m35s)



[don't know if I wouldn't necessarily](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m42s)



[leverage it on our project but](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m44s)



[definitely a worthwhile a worthwhile](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m46s)



[thing to keep in mind so that's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m49s)



[ultimately how they're generating it but](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m51s)



[that leaves me in a good position see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m53s)



[jump back here](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h40m59s)



[when it comes to looking up the themes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m02s)



[for these brushes so it does make me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m07s)



[wonder though at least for the next](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m10s)



[release because this is what makes it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m12s)



[hard is because this has clearly been](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m17s)



[switched for they're there next to o](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m19s)



[release this is coming so I will want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m22s)



[make sure that we are updated for these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m27s)



[and again I'm not sure because we can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m31s)



[kind of cheat and get away with not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m33s)



[supporting all the brushes because we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m36s)



[don't have to necessarily apply all of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m38s)



[them it's only the ones that matter we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m41s)



[create things from Bob's back in the day](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m46s)



[yeah I've done something similar to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m48s)



[where I've needed to have a bunch of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m51s)



[themes where I effectively did just load](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m53s)



[it in as XML and do a find and replace](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m57s)



[on it it's not necessarily a terribly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h41m59s)



[complicated thing but it is one of those](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m03s)



[issues that these types of files you end](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m04s)



[up with a lot of duplication for each](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m07s)



[for each of your color themes which is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m09s)



[part of where we started to end up with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m12s)



[and I think the I think I like our](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m15s)



[codified API because this certainly](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m18s)



[solves part of the problem with dealing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m23s)



[with the spam and trying to manage all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m26s)



[of these but I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m28s)



[necessarily fixes the issue of making it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m30s)



[easier for somebody who wants to change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m32s)



[the color theme it's gonna look I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m34s)



[thought I saw a theme manager sitting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m36s)



[around in here I'm curious what the API](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m38s)



[is yeah a theme manager what's this guy](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m41s)



[what do you do because I'm guessing this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m44s)



[theme manager and theme class of God to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m47s)



[be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m49s)



[similar to what what we built out where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m49s)



[it's effectively a codified version of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m52s)



[it so theme takes in a resource](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m55s)



[dictionary okay so he uses these to pull](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h42m57s)



[out those name display name color themes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m00s)



[stuff great showcase brush a color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m03s)



[scheme base color scheme still just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m09s)



[straight-up string matching which I I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m12s)



[understand not necessarily wanting to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m17s)



[codify your brushes because it means you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m19s)



[have to yeah it is very tedious it means](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m20s)



[you have to keep everything in sync](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m23s)



[which is obnoxious but I I guess my](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m25s)



[opinion is it feels like with good unit](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m30s)



[testing it doesn't really matter so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m33s)



[theme manager very similar to what we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m36s)



[used to do for pulling out all of our](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m42s)



[built-in themes is extract out the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m45s)



[compiled resources which isn't horrible](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m47s)



[totally doable obviously let's see add a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m52s)



[theme pulse to get inverse theme so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h43m56s)



[basically just does a switch on the name](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m05s)



[and looks for the appropriate URI okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m08s)



[steam dictionary resource for map style](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m11s)



[change theme just ain't change theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m14s)



[works it does cap you at using one of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m17s)



[the built-in theme names which is fine](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m21s)



[because the app that I work on that uses](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m27s)



[my apps there is no real theming change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m29s)



[there's a there's a slider that lets you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m31s)



[effectively go from light to dark theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m34s)



[and that's about it so not overly not](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m37s)



[overly advanced let's say yeah so detect](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m42s)



[theme extracts the stuff out yeah okay](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m46s)



[so that for reference this I believe](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m54s)



[here is the hacker II I was talking](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h44m58s)



[about doing](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m02s)



[so because this is and I think this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m03s)



[where I had seen it before the the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m06s)



[Windows 10 stuff you can detect where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m11s)



[let's see so if I do personalize what is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m14s)



[it theme it was the easiest way to get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m21s)



[it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m23s)



[theme in related settings so under](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m24s)



[Windows 8 and Windows 10 they added the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m27s)



[concept of dark theme to Windows where](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m31s)



[the my synced theme is this where it is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m34s)



[I know somewhat hesitant to just change](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m39s)



[it there it is choose your default app](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m42s)



[mode light and dark theme so you can and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m45s)



[I'm I've got this synced across too many](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m48s)



[machines so I don't actually click the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m50s)



[mouse but you can actually go through](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m51s)



[and query this information back out and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m54s)



[so ultimately what I would love to yeah](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h45m57s)



[exactly tied for inherit at the root](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m00s)



[level](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m01s)



[I want to query that value back out and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m02s)



[then default based upon the user setting](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m04s)



[because if you set your window or your](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m06s)



[windows layout into dark theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m09s)



[you probably want your apps to fall into](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m11s)



[dark theme by default again it as the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m13s)



[app developer you're still in control if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m16s)



[you want that behavior you can go with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m18s)



[inherit if you want to you know say no](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m20s)



[my app doesn't look good in dark theme](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m24s)



[I'm gonna do light only great set it to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m25s)



[light you're done but it then leaves it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m27s)



[up to you as the app developer to pick](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m31s)



[sort of which behavior you want to do](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m34s)



[the one thing I will say is if you let](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m36s)



[the users toggle between themes always](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m38s)



[always test in all of them because it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m41s)



[will bite you if you don't I cannot tell](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m44s)



[you how many bugs in my apps I've had to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m46s)



[fix because of that this is always](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m48s)



[interesting so cool well that at least](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m51s)



[gets that lined up and that gives me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m56s)



[pointing in the right direction I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m58s)



[I am going to poke a little bit further](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h46m59s)



[at the mah app stuff I'm probably going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m01s)



[to pull down the one six version of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m04s)



[code and take a look at it just to make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m07s)



[sure that we are covering all of the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m09s)



[brushes for their latest release and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m11s)



[make sure that this is a reasonably](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m13s)



[complete set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m15s)



[again there might be some brushes that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m17s)



[they have that we don't bother to set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m18s)



[because we don't have a meaningful color](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m20s)



[to set there but I think for at least](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m23s)



[all of these these look good in oh so we](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m25s)



[were going to we changed this let's see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m27s)



[I should do this right we should pull](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m33s)



[request it in we should pull request it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m35s)



[I occasionally get into the habit of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m38s)



[just cowboy might commit straight into](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m40s)



[master which is not a good idea](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m43s)



[create branch ma apps brushes will just](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m46s)



[make we have get we can use good](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h47m52s)

[six](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h49m26s)



[and sure poll requests so if people are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h49m27s)



[interested not all of this is public but](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h49m31s)



[at least for like the build pipelines](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h49m35s)



[when you kickoff poll requests you can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h49m38s)



[go through and click and at least get a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h49m41s)

[recently he he'd been out for a little](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m28s)



[bit said he would review it soon and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m31s)



[should be able to get it pushed out so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m34s)



[hopefully soon I'm kind of hoping that I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m35s)



[don't run into too many more of these to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m38s)



[600 issues as I've been fixing them I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m40s)



[might start a 300 branch and just work](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m44s)



[on getting some of the other pull](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m49s)



[requests merging into that just to get a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m50s)



[bit of ahead of the game but I would](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m52s)



[hope in the next week but don't hold me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m56s)



[too tightly to that so other build](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h50m59s)



[pipelines yeah yeah I agree and I'm one](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m03s)



[of the things is with these new](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m07s)



[pipelines I'm kind of hoping that we can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m08s)



[increase the the speed in the Akkadians](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m10s)



[because right now doing a release](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m13s)



[there's a bunch of manual steps and I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m14s)



[trying to automate all of those away](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m16s)



[so this one here this one actually](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m18s)



[helped me out earlier today so on the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m21s)



[wiki we have a page that lists out all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m23s)



[of the control styles that are inside of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m26s)



[the library and one of the things so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m29s)



[there's a this guy fires up there's a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m33s)



[nice little hidden mark down comment](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m37s)



[if you if you do go to hit edit I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m41s)



[hoping this big warning right at the top](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m43s)



[of the file tells people please don't](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m45s)



[because this on every merge into master](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m47s)



[this build pipeline runs and it kicks](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m52s)



[off a PowerShell script that's right](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m55s)



[inside of the scripts directory that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m58s)



[generates this markdown and in addition](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h51m59s)



[to generating it it all it just pushes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m03s)



[it straight over the top of the wiki so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m04s)



[if you edit this manually your change is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m07s)



[going to get wiped out the very next](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m11s)



[merge into master so one of those things](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m12s)



[that I just got annoyed managing myself](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m15s)



[and so I hijacked it and said okay I'm](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m17s)



[done managing this I'm gonna start](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m21s)



[scripting it just to keep things in sync](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m23s)



[and then my release pipelines look a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m24s)



[little bit uglier so there is a icon](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m29s)



[update one and this one's actually set](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m35s)



[to kick off at midnight my time once a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m37s)



[day and its sole purpose in life is to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m40s)



[go out to the material design icons](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m43s)



[website and run our icon update and if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m46s)



[it finds changes create a pull request](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m51s)



[with the changes into master so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m53s)



[hopefully I will stop running into](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m56s)



[issues now with this library falling](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h52m58s)



[behind when they release new icons and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m02s)



[may not realize it or miss an update so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m05s)



[I figure running this once a day is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m07s)



[probably good enough to be reasonably](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m10s)



[up-to-date I think a video and github](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m12s)



[with me nice oh yeah I'd happily to go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m17s)



[through and show it's actually so the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m23s)



[Edit of the wiki with the exception of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m25s)



[this page this is the only page I would](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m28s)



[say don't edit but with most of these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m30s)



[for example the getting started guide if](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m32s)



[you come across with any issues or](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m35s)



[changes that you see it's just a matter](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m39s)



[of hitting the edit button and making](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m41s)



[the appropriate changes everyone has](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m44s)



[right permission to the wiki I do keep a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m46s)



[local clone up-to-date so don't worry](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m49s)



[about making changes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m52s)



[in the event that anything goes through](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m55s)



[that's bad the wiki itself is actually](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m56s)



[just a git repo so if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h53m59s)



[clone everything locally and edit a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m01s)



[bunch of files at once you can do that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m03s)



[but again it's a public repo everyone](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m05s)



[has push access so anyone can make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m08s)



[changes in improvements so if you see](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m11s)



[something that you want added go for it](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m13s)



[I watched the changes and as long as](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m16s)



[it's nothing horrible I usually let any](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m19s)



[improvements people are willing to make](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m22s)



[are more than welcome so and just going](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m23s)



[back so and then the normal release](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m27s)



[pipeline this one gets a little this one](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m28s)



[gets uglier so this this is one that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m31s)



[I've been poking at and playing at for a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m35s)



[while so the the build pipeline that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m38s)



[kicks off on every merge to master](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m45s)



[generates artifacts this things set up](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m47s)



[on a once a day schedule and the idea](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m50s)



[being that these CI builds would get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m53s)



[triggered once a day on the schedule](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m57s)



[because right now a player runs on every](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h54m58s)



[merging to master and that can get a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m01s)



[little noisy for the CI nougat packages](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m04s)



[that are coming out especially when a1](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m07s)



[I'm like reviewing and pulling in a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m09s)



[bunch of pull requests it'll kick off a](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m11s)



[new CI package for every single one of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m13s)



[them so this will slow it down to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m15s)



[basically just nightly builds per day](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m18s)



[that way if I merge something in and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m20s)



[maybe there's a bug with it that needs](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m23s)



[to be fixed we don't necessarily get bad](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m24s)



[packages distributed so I figured that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m26s)



[would be a little bit of a help there's](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m28s)



[a approver gate to go out to nougat so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m30s)



[the idea being that this CI build ends](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m34s)



[up going into these art of this](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m38s)



[artifacts which is a private nougat feed](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m42s)



[effectively for me to test and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m44s)



[approve button out the door and it goes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m46s)



[out to nougat and then one more approver](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m48s)



[gate to actually publish the full nougat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m51s)



[package out to new georg these things](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m54s)



[are misleading names](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h55m58s)



[it says nougat org right here but right](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m00s)



[now it's tied into more private feeds on](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m02s)



[this side](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m06s)



[basically I'm simulating nougat org with](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m09s)



[these artifacts just to make sure](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m11s)



[everything's working right and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m13s)



[ultimately I'm going to whack them and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m15s)



[switch it to actually point to nougat](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m17s)



[org so just one of those like I said is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m18s)



[part of getting rid of app ver and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m21s)



[moving to DevOps](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m24s)



[this whole kind of build stage pipeline](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m26s)



[with this type of setup specifically](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m30s)



[being able to walk individual packages](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m35s)



[because just because one package works](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m40s)



[its way down this line doesn't mean all](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m43s)



[three of them will necessarily go at the](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m45s)



[same rate so we can now Rev each of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m47s)



[these individually which will be nice so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m50s)



[for example my apps kicks out an update](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m52s)



[we need to add some brushes great we can](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m54s)



[just walk something through these stages](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m56s)



[out the door and we're done](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h56m58s)



[so once I'm confident that this is](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m00s)



[actually working the way I expect I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m03s)



[think this will be the next the next](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m06s)



[pass at making everything go so and then](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m08s)



[it'll actually get tied into nougat org](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m11s)



[rather than pointed at my private feeds](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m13s)



[because these things I keep every time](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m15s)



[there's an issue with it I don't want to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m17s)



[necessarily spam nougat org with my my](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m19s)



[bad versioning or bugs that I've gone](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m22s)



[through so once this is all stable and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m24s)



[and running hopefully it should work so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m27s)



[this has been a fun thing for me of](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m29s)



[doing a bunch of DevOps stuff so and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m32s)



[this all checks passed great squash and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m34s)



[merge this won't be aware the app fair](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m39s)



[isn't kicking out builds for the MA](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m47s)



[apps for the MA apps NuGet package right](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m50s)



[now so I will look at addressing that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m54s)



[and getting a new preview package up for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h57m57s)



[this library so that it's not broken for](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m00s)



[everybody because it it needs to affect](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m02s)



[both the colors and the MA apps packages](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m05s)



[as well so I'll make sure that those get](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m08s)



[updated on nougat org and the next day](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m09s)



[or two so those will be those will be](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m11s)



[going but just be aware that the stuff](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m15s)



[that's sitting out on new georg right](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m16s)



[now if you have the latest you are](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m19s)



[probably going to be broken so](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m20s)



[grab a package that's earlier than say](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m22s)



[Sunday so for those people who aren't in](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m24s)



[my time something before the 7th and you](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m28s)



[should be fine](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m31s)



[because I think the seventh is when I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m32s)



[was making changes ok with that I think](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m34s)



[I've reached about my two-hour mark](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m40s)



[hopefully this was helpful it made me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m41s)



[feel better to be able to catch these](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m43s)



[bugs thank you guys for dropping in and](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m45s)



[we will be planning on doing this again](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m48s)



[next week if there are things that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m51s)



[people are interested in seen or](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m53s)



[examples I think I'm probably going to](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m54s)



[potentially start in on doing some](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h58m58s)



[examples on WPF and mvvm next](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m01s)



[specifically using this library but I](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m05s)



[think next week might be a little more](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m08s)



[WPF generic rather than material design](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m10s)



[specific so we'll see how that goes](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m13s)



[again if people have other things that](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m16s)



[you want to see or examples or questions](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m18s)



[feel free to just shoot them over to me](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m20s)



[you can either comment on videos or](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m22s)



[something on the git er chat usually](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m24s)



[gets to me pretty quick and we will go](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m26s)



[from there so with that say goodnight](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m28s)



[happy coding guys and thanks for hanging](https://youtu.be/1gHAKhFBcOU?t=01h59m32s)
