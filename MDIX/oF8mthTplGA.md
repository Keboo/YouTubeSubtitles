[00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h03m45s)

okay we will go ahead and get started


[00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,209](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h03m48s)

since I think I'm a few minutes late


[00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:56,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h03m49s)

anyway okay so today we are going to do


[00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,879](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h03m53s)

more material design in zamel work last


[00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h03m56s)

time for those people who can remember


[00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,209](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h03m58s)

two weeks back I think it was I had left


[00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m01s)

off working on some scroll bar


[00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m05s)

interactions for the two sick so release


[00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m07s)

so there was a desire to put in a better


[00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m10s)

scroll bar something that actually sort


[00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m13s)

of mimics the scroll bar that we see on


[00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:23,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m15s)

the Google material design spec website


[00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m18s)

and actually will let me switch scenes


[00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,449](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m23s)

real quick and I'll go back through and


[00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m24s)

do it so I think that is where we are


[00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:38,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m26s)

going to start let's see here so there's


[00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:46,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m30s)

that drill design and let's take a look


[00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:48,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m38s)

here so on this site which is somewhat


[00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m46s)

what I'm going to base this design on


[00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m48s)

because there's not there's not actually


[00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:56,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m50s)

a declaration in the spec of what a


[00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m53s)

scroll bar should look like largely


[00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m56s)

because I think material design was


[00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h04m58s)

probably designed for phone and so some


[00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m01s)

of the desktop II type controls aren't


[00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,729](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m03s)

necessarily fully outlined and so it


[00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,669](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m06s)

gives a little bit of creative behavior


[00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m07s)

but you can see that this scroll bar one


[00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m10s)

unlike the normal windows one doesn't


[00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m12s)

have the the repeat buttons the the


[00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m15s)

scroll up and scroll down huh I guess


[00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m17s)

this one does it's just hiding the one


[00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:25,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m18s)

at the top but it has the gray faded out


[00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m23s)

darkens a little bit as your mouse goes


[00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m25s)

over darkens even more on the click and


[00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m28s)

then you can scroll up and down so


[00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m29s)

that's sort of what we were going for


[00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:39,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m31s)

there is an issue out on the github repo


[00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m36s)

where there was some discussion going


[00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m39s)

back and forth with a bunch of people


[00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m41s)

kind of weighing in on what what the


[00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,729](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m43s)

scrollbar inside of this library needs


[00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m45s)

to have and should have and so sort of a


[00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,349](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m49s)

couple features that were outlined is


[00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,349](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m52s)

the ability to show and hide these


[00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:58,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m54s)

buttons there was very much a desire for


[00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m57s)

that to be


[00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h05m58s)

effectively an attached property or


[00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m00s)

optional so that people could turn that


[00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m01s)

on or off or opt into having those


[00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,819](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m03s)

hidden because on Windows it does sort


[00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:13,819](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m05s)

of make sense to show that most of the


[00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:15,499](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m07s)

time and then also and I'll admit to


[00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:17,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m13s)

being sort of the the one behind this


[00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:19,729](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m15s)

there was this desire to be able to sort


[00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m17s)

of round the corners so the this bit


[00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m19s)

that goes up and down inside of the


[00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m21s)

scroll bar is called the thumb and so


[00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m23s)

being able to sort of round this off so


[00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m25s)

that you can get a rounded look to that


[00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m27s)

was also something that people at least


[00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:35,719](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m30s)

expressed desire to be configurable so


[00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,069](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m33s)

with that in mind that's sort of where


[00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m35s)

we were going if anyone has questions


[00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m37s)

feel free to drop in the chat I do not


[00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,789](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m39s)

mind getting distracted from whatever


[00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m41s)

I'm looking at otherwise I'm just gonna


[00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:48,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m43s)

plow straight ahead on what I had in


[00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,439](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m46s)

mind for doing on this but again I I


[00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m48s)

love answering questions I love working


[00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m51s)

on the git er chat room so if people


[00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m53s)

have questions then feel free to post


[00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m54s)

them always happy to go through and do


[00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h06m58s)

that so that is where we were going and


[00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,349](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m01s)

last time we had started with a pull


[00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m03s)

request that was put in but then let me


[00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,969](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m06s)

grab it here real quick there was


[00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:16,419](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m08s)

another pull request that came in last


[00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:19,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m10s)

week that got updated earlier today I


[00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:24,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m16s)

grabbed that and I'll show you what's in


[00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:26,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m19s)

there so there's and it actually


[00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,089](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m24s)

interested me because the the pull


[00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,509](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m26s)

request that we had left off with lacked


[00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,699](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m29s)

a couple things and then this one


[00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,169](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m32s)

specifically those optional toggles for


[00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m34s)

showing and hiding the repeat buttons


[00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,839](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m36s)

and then you can see the the zoom this


[00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,819](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m39s)

in a little bit the rounding of the


[00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m41s)

corners on the scroll bar to be able to


[00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:52,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m43s)

make those configurable as well so


[00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,529](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m46s)

Albert I'm probably Alonso I apologize


[00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m52s)

if I'm butchering that last name sent in


[00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,779](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m54s)

this pull request which is great it


[00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m56s)

actually covers almost everything that


[00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:06,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h07m59s)

we need in here the one thing that I


[00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:09,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m01s)

think is missing it so he commented that


[00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,519](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m06s)

he saw that this P are duplicates 651


[00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m09s)

which is the one that we were looking at


[00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m10s)

before but I think this


[00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m11s)

it's actually a little bit further along


[00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m13s)

than that one so I wanted to start from


[00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m16s)

there


[00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m17s)

because I think this one affected


[00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m19s)

there's a lot of overlap because there's


[00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m21s)

only there's only so much you can do


[00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:29,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m23s)

with these scroll bar styles and not


[00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:32,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m25s)

duplicate existing work but I think this


[00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m29s)

one is is mildly ahead of where where we


[00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m32s)

left off on the last stream so I think


[00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m34s)

we're gonna pick it up there and run


[00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m37s)

with it so I have I have the pull


[00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:48,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m41s)

request checked out but what I do not


[00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:51,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m43s)

have is the latest changes for it so


[00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m48s)

what we are going to do is stash what I


[00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m51s)

had looked at and then I'm gonna pull up


[00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m54s)

the latest changes from his branch and


[00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:06,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h08m56s)

then we will go from there so let's


[00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:07,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m00s)

let's grab the latest because there was


[00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m06s)

a couple things about this that I wanted


[00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m07s)

to clean up and he actually took care of


[00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:17,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m10s)

them earlier so we'll start from there


[00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m13s)

so I'll pull successful I think you get


[00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m17s)

cracking go ahead and refresh great and


[00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m21s)

then let's let's pop my stash real quick


[00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m24s)

and there's probably a conflict or two


[00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m27s)

so let's take a look real quick I can


[00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:36,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m30s)

probably just take his changes because I


[00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:41,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m33s)

think it's probably yeah around these


[00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:43,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m36s)

same brushes see ultimately ended up


[00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m41s)

removing them which is one of the things


[00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m43s)

I wanted to do that's the only conflict


[00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:53,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m45s)

so perfect perfect perfect perfect okay


[00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m49s)

so let's let's take a quick look and see


[00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m53s)

I just want to refresh my memory where I


[00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m56s)

had left off because I had looked at


[00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m57s)

this pull request earlier and had


[00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:07,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h09m59s)

started down this path of being able to


[00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m03s)

work with it so there was this I had


[00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m07s)

started pulling in the visual state


[00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:14,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m08s)

manager on the scroll bar for those who


[00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m11s)

watch the last video ultimately that's


[00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m14s)

what we're going to use to go through


[00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m15s)

and do the lightening and darkening one


[00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m19s)

of the issues that I did notice right


[00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,639](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m21s)

away is the


[00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,069](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m22s)

current lightening and darkening that's


[00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m24s)

happening right now was coming from the


[00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:32,439](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m27s)

scroll viewer not necessarily the


[00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,079](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m29s)

scrollbar itself which was causing a lot


[00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:39,009](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m32s)

of problems so one this was initially


[00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:41,529](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m35s)

done with the old control template


[00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:45,459](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m39s)

triggers doing enter and exit actions


[00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,949](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m41s)

which are fine however you can sometimes


[00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:51,579](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m45s)

run into timing issues with both of


[00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:53,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m47s)

these on enter and exits and so it's use


[00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,939](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m51s)

because both of these are begins


[00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m53s)

storyboard don't necessarily stop


[00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:59,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m54s)

storyboard and so generally you want to


[00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,569](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m57s)

end up using the visual state manager


[00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h10m59s)

over this pattern this is just old code


[00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:05,319](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m01s)

that hasn't been touched in a very long


[00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m03s)

time so as part of this I think we're


[00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:14,379](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m05s)

going to rip this out because this was


[00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:17,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m09s)

defaulting to applying an opacity of 56%


[00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:20,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m14s)

and so we are going to switch and let


[00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m17s)

the scrollbar itself be in charge of


[00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,699](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m20s)

managing that rather than having the


[00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m22s)

scroll viewer sort of dictate that from


[00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:29,379](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m24s)

above so I think that's where we left


[00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m27s)

off let's fire this guy up and make sure


[00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,819](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m29s)

we're back in a good working state


[00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:38,319](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m32s)

because I know I had broken this several


[00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:41,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m33s)

times over before lots of stuff I don't


[00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:43,389](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m38s)

need this one I don't need this one so


[00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m41s)

let's come back over here so we've got


[00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:47,829](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m43s)

scroll bars where we primarily want to


[00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m45s)

work and then scroll viewer just with


[00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:53,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m47s)

the stuff that we took off so let's fire


[00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:56,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m49s)

this guy up the other thing that he did


[00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m53s)

was he went through and added in or that


[00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m56s)

I should say that Albert did is he went


[00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,319](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m57s)

through and he actually applied it as we


[00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h11m59s)

saw from those screenshots to the scroll


[00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:08,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m02s)

bar where you can pick the various views


[00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:13,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m06s)

inside of the the demo app so we're


[00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:16,569](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m08s)

gonna take a look at that and just sort


[00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m13s)

of use that as our guide and hopefully


[00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:27,899](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m16s)

end up with something again that looks


[00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,899](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m19s)

kind of like this yeah come back yeah so


[00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:36,459](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m27s)

and we will go from there come on Visual


[00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m34s)

Studio you can do it I know it's hard


[00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:41,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m36s)

I know it's hard there's so many things


[00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:45,899](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m38s)

for you to be doing right now I didn't


[00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,899](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m41s)

hope I'd hoped to go through and use a


[00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m45s)

different screen share utility so I


[00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,889](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m50s)

could split the streaming across two


[00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m51s)

machines but unfortunately ran out of


[00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m53s)

time this afternoon getting that set up


[00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,509](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m56s)

so that will be an attempt for next time


[00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h12m59s)

just so that I can hopefully get these


[00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m01s)

compiles sped up so this machine isn't


[00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,439](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m03s)

doing the streaming and the the code


[00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:11,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m05s)

compiling all together because this is a


[00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:14,279](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m08s)

decent machine but it was was never


[00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,269](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m11s)

designed to do this much


[00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m14s)

okay so let's pop this guy open here and


[00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:24,779](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m18s)

there we have it so there is the scroll


[00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:31,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m20s)

bar as it currently sits let's see when


[00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:31,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m24s)

magnifier come on where's my magnifier


[00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:42,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m33s)

so if we take a little bit let's see


[00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:46,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m37s)

here what is it windows plus there we go


[00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m42s)

you can see on here sort of the set up


[00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m46s)

with the the rounded corners and the


[00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:54,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m47s)

repeat buttons the one thing that it is


[00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m49s)

missing is I do want this to one be a


[00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m54s)

lighter shade until you mouse over it


[00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m56s)

and have it darken and then darken a


[00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h13m58s)

little bit more again when you


[00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:09,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m01s)

ultimately click on it that that's I


[00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:13,589](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m04s)

think where we're going to go so back


[00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m09s)

out back out Thank You magnifier so I'm


[00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m13s)

gonna leave that guy running because I


[00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m14s)

think I can probably get away with this


[00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m16s)

so one thing I wanted to look at is so


[00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m19s)

there's there's a bunch of these styles


[00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m21s)

around the repeat buttons and all of


[00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m23s)

those and I'm a little bit less


[00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m25s)

concerned with those for the moment


[00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:37,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m28s)

let's see scroll bar button scroll bar


[00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m31s)

and just for my own sanity I prefer to


[00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m37s)

have these things separated with some


[00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m39s)

sort of space between them so I can see


[00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:49,279](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m41s)

so I believe these are the visual state


[00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:52,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m44s)

groups available on the scroll bar as a


[00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m49s)

cheater mode one of the things you can


[00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m52s)

always do is punch in WPF default


[00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m56s)

control templates I believe it gets me


[00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:07,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h14m58s)

there and this guy so there's a


[00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m03s)

wonderful Doc's page and the and I will


[00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m07s)

say this the styles and templates shown


[00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m08s)

here are very similar to the default WPF


[00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m12s)

ones but they are in no means identical


[00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m14s)

so don't take this to be when you look


[00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,420](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m17s)

at this that oh this is exactly what the


[00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m19s)

default one looks like it's it's close


[00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m21s)

but I have found discrepancies part of


[00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,529](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m24s)

it I think comes from the fact that the


[00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,029](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m26s)

default templates have been kind of


[00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m28s)

updated over time so this may have


[00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m30s)

matched at one point but it is just


[00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m32s)

meant as a guide so the key part here


[00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m34s)

that we're looking for is on the scroll


[00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m38s)

bar


[00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m39s)

so these scroll bar states is what we're


[00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m41s)

looking for so these are the various


[00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,029](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m43s)

visual states that we can or that the


[00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m46s)

control looks


[00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m48s)

and we'll transition into based upon you


[00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:57,139](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m50s)

know when the mouse goes over when it's


[00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:59,579](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m51s)

disabled etc so that is what we are


[00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m57s)

going for and I think really what we're


[00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,149](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h15m59s)

looking for is normal mouse over and


[00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:10,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m01s)

then we'll probably have to do something


[00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:14,209](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m03s)

a little different for the drag normal


[00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:21,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m10s)

or mouse why do I have pressed in here I


[00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:24,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m14s)

did not see pressed in the lineup scroll


[00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m21s)

by thumb vertical scrollbar why did I


[00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m24s)

think pressed was a choice that one may


[00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m27s)

just be invalid it's worth noting with


[00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m30s)

the visual state manager it's very you


[00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m32s)

can declare any visual state that you


[00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m34s)

want the problem is the control itself


[00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m37s)

is what declares the states that it's


[00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,579](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m40s)

going to move into so let's just take a


[00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,499](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m44s)

look here real quick


[00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,809](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m46s)

normally the controls for the visual


[00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:53,759](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m49s)

states are decorated right at the top


[00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:55,589](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m51s)

but I can't remember whether those show


[00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m53s)

up if you look at the decompiled source


[00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:03,959](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m55s)

or if those are elsewhere they don't


[00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:07,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h16m59s)

show up here we could probably poke


[00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:14,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m03s)

around but I am I'm not really


[00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:16,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m07s)

interested it's just yeah yeah I was


[00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m14s)

kind of thinking that those are probably


[00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,689](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m16s)

buried in different spots so not gonna


[00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m18s)

worry about it for now but what we do


[00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:27,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m21s)

want to do is deal with this guy so


[00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:31,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m24s)

we've got an opacity being set and I


[00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:35,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m27s)

defaulted it to 56 and I think what we


[00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,399](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m31s)

want to do is just bring in something


[00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,059](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m35s)

like this or it's going to be not a


[00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:44,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m38s)

color animation that much is wrong but


[00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m42s)

it's going to be kill execution the


[00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m44s)

lines am will edit is good to a point


[00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m46s)

until it's not and then you really just


[00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:57,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m50s)

got a jump out so let's do come on


[00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m53s)

that's my tell sense double animation


[00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:08,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h17m58s)

see and we will go from there let's make


[00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m05s)

it really obvious I guess at the moment


[00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:19,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m08s)

duration I think we probably want


[00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:21,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m12s)

something like fairly fast 2/10 of a


[00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:30,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m19s)

second oh let's see


[00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:33,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m21s)

so storyboard I think we can do target


[00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m30s)

name here and get away with doing the


[00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:43,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m33s)

background and then storyboard target


[00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:46,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m37s)

property pay city so let's just collapse


[00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:50,429](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m43s)

this and let's get some more more space


[00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m46s)

to see code ok let's take a look at that


[00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m50s)

and hopefully this starts to get us


[00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m52s)

closer to that because I think this


[00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:59,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m53s)

scrollbar PR is really close I just want


[00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:03,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m56s)

to get these animations and states


[00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:07,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h18m59s)

figured out because I think the this is


[00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:11,309](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m03s)

probably going to be the last big big in


[00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:14,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m07s)

quotes UI bit that gets added to the to


[00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m11s)

600 release there's a chance or I should


[00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,179](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m14s)

say it's the last one I'm likely to work


[00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m16s)

on to add if there's a pull request that


[00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m18s)

comes in something might get considered


[00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:28,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m21s)

but the to 600 release is largely going


[00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m23s)

to be around the new theming API there's


[00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m28s)

lots of bug fixes and little things


[00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m30s)

people have brought in so thank you to


[00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m32s)

everyone who's contributed and then this


[00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m35s)

scrollbar I think is probably going to


[00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:45,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m37s)

be the big big ticket items and after


[00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:50,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m42s)

that I'm hoping that the next big one


[00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m45s)

that gets merged in is the support for


[00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:04,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m52s)

dotnet 300 or net standard 5 as it's now


[00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:04,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h19m57s)

being called you know worky-worky


[00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m05s)

so now the question is what the heck did


[00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:15,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m07s)

I do wrong let's jump back here real


[00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:23,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m09s)

quick and make sure that's over the


[00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:26,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m15s)

control okay that's that's no bueno so


[00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m23s)

let's start with everybody's favorite UI


[00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:34,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m26s)

debugging tools snoop the the UI stuff


[00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:36,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m30s)

and Visual Studio is okay but by and


[00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m34s)

large I still consider snoop leaps and


[00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m36s)

bounds ahead of it even just something


[00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:45,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m39s)

simple as the difference between this


[00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:48,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m41s)

property editor versus the live property


[00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,309](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m45s)

editor the one advantage the visual


[00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m48s)

studio tools have is they can link back


[00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:58,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m51s)

to your original source code when they


[00:20:52,990 --> 00:21:01,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m52s)

find it so that much is convenient so


[00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:04,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h20m58s)

let's see it's ultimately up here it's


[00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m01s)

this guy that we're hoping to modify so


[00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:12,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m04s)

just make sure it's not my eyes biting


[00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:17,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m06s)

me oh hold up am I looking at the wrong


[00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:20,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m12s)

border because that says BD not BG where


[00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m17s)

am I at


[00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:28,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m20s)

scrollbar grid that's the scroll viewer


[00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:43,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m29s)

scrollbar okay so there scrollbar grid


[00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:48,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m38s)

AP button track okay what am i doing


[00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:51,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m43s)

here Terral design scrollbar so let's


[00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m48s)

just make sure that this guy's style so


[00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m51s)

on this property editor you can always


[00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:05,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m54s)

go through and do a pipe to basically do


[00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h21m58s)

an or filter to find to find out or to


[00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m05s)

filter on different properties so


[00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m06s)

anything that has a pasty or style in it


[00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m09s)

will then show up so you can see a bunch


[00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:19,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m11s)

of these guys are now matched just great


[00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:27,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m16s)

so implicit style but which style is


[00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:29,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m19s)

this interesting so this guy I assume


[00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:37,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m27s)

this is the implicit scrollbar style and


[00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:41,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m29s)

this is the one that's based on and


[00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:44,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m37s)

Tristan I am I just looking at the wrong


[00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:57,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m41s)

style to begin with


[00:22:44,400 --> 00:23:01,059](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m44s)

this guy's based on the style so fuchsia


[00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h22m57s)

when in doubt make it ugly and it will


[00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m01s)

show


[00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:26,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m12s)

so I must have the wrong style in here


[00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:26,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m16s)

so let's take a look is there oh hang on


[00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m27s)

or you know this is oriented this is a


[00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:38,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m30s)

trigger on orientation horizontal that's


[00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m33s)

fine we should be orientation vertical


[00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m39s)

what's going on here scroll bar button


[00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m43s)

line


[00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:52,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m44s)

why don't I eat see this in my visual


[00:23:46,970 --> 00:24:00,669](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m46s)

tree Oh control template vertical


[00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:08,299](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h23m52s)

scrollbar this unfortunately looks like


[00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:11,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m00s)

horizontal scrollbar haha t resign


[00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:11,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m08s)

scrollbar style


[00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:20,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m12s)

haha I've been looking at the wrong one


[00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:24,799](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m16s)

so these ones here so let's ignore the


[00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:29,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m20s)

horizontal one for a moment the vertical


[00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:33,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m24s)

scrollbar so we have this guy here I


[00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:38,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m29s)

suspect means he's not used much or he's


[00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:43,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m33s)

an opt-in ah material design scrollbar


[00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:47,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m38s)

style versus material design scrollbar


[00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:56,809](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m43s)

right if I had read carefully I think I


[00:24:47,720 --> 00:25:03,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m47s)

remember and this pull request that


[00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:09,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h24m56s)

these are new styles not additions to


[00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m03s)

the old one got it


[00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:19,389](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m10s)

oh boy now I now I'm left with another


[00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:22,329](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m14s)

choice and I'm somewhat inclined to


[00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:25,569](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m19s)

bring in so this guy is actually using


[00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:28,049](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m22s)

the button ones so we're gonna bring


[00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,049](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m25s)

that in


[00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:36,069](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m29s)

I'll see well hold on before I bring


[00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:48,179](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m32s)

this in the question should be should


[00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:48,179](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m36s)

this exist here boy


[00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m53s)

just on somewhat inclined to a minimum I


[00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:07,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m57s)

like the name the material design


[00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:08,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h25m58s)

scrollbar and that way at least in your


[00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,309](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m07s)

intellisense once you type material


[00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m08s)

design scrollbar everything else comes


[00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:18,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m11s)

as a suffix to that or as this has the


[00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:23,779](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m14s)

name change in the middle well not


[00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:30,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m18s)

necessarily here but hmm


[00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:37,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m23s)

but this duh okay so let's change this


[00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:40,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m30s)

up a little bit because this allows for


[00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m37s)

[Music]


[00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:54,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m44s)

pulling this through so there's the


[00:26:46,280 --> 00:27:02,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m46s)

visibility scrollbar align button that's


[00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:06,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h26m54s)

where these guys come in boy I am really


[00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:11,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m02s)

tempted to just replace the original


[00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:15,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m06s)

ones with these really tempted to


[00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:18,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m11s)

replace these so I'm a little hesitant


[00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m15s)

to add in a bunch of new keys if I can


[00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m18s)

make the old ones work so let's go back


[00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m21s)

then up to the digital to the demo and


[00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m25s)

we might so we might have a little bit


[00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:34,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m27s)

of chicken in the egg here where I've


[00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m32s)

got some stuff on one pull request and


[00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:39,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m34s)

some stuff on another and I kind of want


[00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:44,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m35s)

a little bit of both well let's go


[00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:47,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m39s)

through here and do this so how are


[00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m44s)

let's just look at get real quick how


[00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m47s)

was this applied on the main window so


[00:27:50,180 --> 00:28:00,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m50s)

that would have been his first commit


[00:27:53,060 --> 00:28:00,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h27m53s)

here main window just look at the diff


[00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m00s)

toolbar selected index where am I


[00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:18,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m11s)

so it's being done like that with the


[00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:28,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m15s)

list box resources got it


[00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:28,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m18s)

okay that's the dialog host whereas


[00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:39,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m32s)

I must do there must have been some


[00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:48,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m35s)

cleanup on the next commit huh look at


[00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:52,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m39s)

that there was pulled that back out and


[00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:57,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m48s)

what was the defaults change here then


[00:28:52,350 --> 00:29:03,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m52s)

let's see type scroll bar so the default


[00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:06,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h28m57s)

scroll bar was swapped out got it okay


[00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:08,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m03s)

so that means that there really isn't


[00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:15,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m06s)

anything to do in the main window per se


[00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:19,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m08s)

however the change then comes down here


[00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:22,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m15s)

and our defaults so to get back to our


[00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:26,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m19s)

other one we need our scroll bar here


[00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:30,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m22s)

and we'll drop back into the other one


[00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:32,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m26s)

so that will cause us to lose the nice


[00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:36,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m30s)

rounded corner options and the


[00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m32s)

minimalist width but I think we can fix


[00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:43,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m36s)

that so I think what we'll do is we'll


[00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m41s)

just bring up the portions of these


[00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m43s)

templates into the existing ones and


[00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:52,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m47s)

then we can whack the new the new


[00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m50s)

templates and just take the I'll just


[00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m52s)

scavenge the bits and pieces that we


[00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:03,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m54s)

want because I think that my preference


[00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:05,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h29m56s)

is to not necessarily add new styles I I


[00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m03s)

know that because that was one of the


[00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m05s)

questions on that scroll bar issue of


[00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m07s)

whether there should be brand new styles


[00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m10s)

that people can use to opt into or


[00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m12s)

whether there should be attached


[00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m13s)

properties both of them kind of have


[00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m17s)

their pluses and minuses attached


[00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m18s)

properties the biggest drawback to them


[00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m20s)

is it's really hard for people to


[00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m22s)

discover them they they usually either


[00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:29,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m24s)

have to see an example or find some bit


[00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:34,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m28s)

of documentation that says hey by the


[00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m29s)

way this is their however they do make


[00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m34s)

things really convenient for sort of


[00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m36s)

those more obscure changes that a lot of


[00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:45,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m39s)

people don't necessarily want and so we


[00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m43s)

may end up keeping I think


[00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m45s)

we might do is I might just move the


[00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m48s)

word minimal on the second style to the


[00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:55,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m50s)

end and we'll have an overloaded style


[00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m53s)

for kind of getting some of these these


[00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m55s)

defaults out the gate there we go


[00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:09,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h30m57s)

there's our ugly fuchsia and now we're


[00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:09,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m01s)

getting the opacity change


[00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:21,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m15s)

interesting that the opacity is starting


[00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m18s)

at one and changing I thought we were


[00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m21s)

different


[00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:32,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m22s)

default in that differently okay that


[00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:37,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m24s)

gets us okay so let's put you back to


[00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:41,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m32s)

transparent and that should come on


[00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m37s)

going update going update the controls


[00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m41s)

okay so that goes there


[00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m45s)

it's on mouse-over


[00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:57,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m51s)

but that feels a lot darker than I want


[00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:03,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m53s)

it to be so for starters let's have this


[00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:05,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h31m57s)

guy go to one and this guy we're gonna


[00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m03s)

bump up to I don't know


[00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m05s)

Oh point seven shooting from the hip for


[00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:23,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m08s)

the moment because I kind of want to


[00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:29,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m10s)

compare a little bit nicer a little bit


[00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:33,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m23s)

nicer where is the not that one this guy


[00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:36,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m29s)

you sit to the side for a second that is


[00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m33s)

a lot darker until I get to this so I'm


[00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m36s)

thinking whatever brush we're using is


[00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m38s)

not near dark enough so let's start with


[00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:48,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m42s)

that and figure out where that thumb


[00:32:45,280 --> 00:33:04,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m45s)

color is coming from so this guy down


[00:32:48,760 --> 00:33:07,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h32m48s)

here to then thumb this guy up here so


[00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m04s)

so I'm also keeping track of my son he


[00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:15,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m07s)

had surgery this last week and got his


[00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:19,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m12s)

tonsils removed and so he is he is


[00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:26,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m15s)

having a bad week okay so we're using


[00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:29,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m19s)

the divider as the


[00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:33,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m26s)

Phil and also for the dragon color and I


[00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:36,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m29s)

think I want this guy to go darker so


[00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:39,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m33s)

let's take a look at what that what that


[00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:43,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m36s)

is so I believe inside that is declared


[00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:47,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m39s)

in the colors recommended themes for


[00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:57,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m43s)

primary and dark oh those might actually


[00:33:47,140 --> 00:34:04,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m47s)

be declared up here same colors okay


[00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:08,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h33m57s)

show me the light that one please


[00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m04s)

where are you declared nobody Oh buddy


[00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:14,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m08s)

there you go


[00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:18,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m10s)

okay so material design divider so this


[00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:20,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m14s)

is effectively black at 12% which is


[00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m18s)

part of the problem because we're


[00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m20s)

playing with the transparency of the


[00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m23s)

control and the color that's being


[00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m25s)

applied already has some amount of


[00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:34,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m27s)

transparency applied to it I don't think


[00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:39,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m30s)

that's quite where we want it to go I'm


[00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m34s)

wondering if I feel like dividers not


[00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:44,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m39s)

what I want to go with and I don't know


[00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:49,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m41s)

if we've got a good brush preemptively


[00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:53,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m44s)

for this somewhat inclined to do


[00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:59,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m49s)

something crazy with like the body brush


[00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:59,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m53s)

but that that feels wrong as well I


[00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h34m59s)

don't really want to repurpose the snack


[00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m02s)

bar ones because those are clearly out


[00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m04s)

there and I'm a little hesitant to go


[00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m06s)

through and create new ones I


[00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m08s)

Deeley a lot of these brushes should be


[00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:18,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m11s)

single purpose and I think this divider


[00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:23,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m14s)

one has gotten over purposed a lot the


[00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:27,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m18s)

advantage of the body color is it does


[00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:30,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m23s)

give us is this is declared and all of


[00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m27s)

the themes already it's effectively the


[00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m30s)

the color of like your foreground text


[00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m33s)

of what it would get applied to and so


[00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m35s)

this would then flow with the theme and


[00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:43,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m37s)

switch because I do want this to look


[00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:49,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m39s)

good with the dark theme I think maybe


[00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:51,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m43s)

we go with the light one let's go to the


[00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:54,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m49s)

dark one let's just let's play with it


[00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m51s)

and see what it looks like so don't need


[00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:02,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m54s)

you anymore come back over to scrollbar


[00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:05,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h35m56s)

okay so so you're gonna take that and


[00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:11,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m02s)

you're gonna take that and that gets us


[00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:13,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m05s)

a little bit further and these values


[00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:19,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m11s)

probably need to be adjusted again then


[00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:24,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m13s)

but let's see what that does for us way


[00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:31,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m19s)

too dark but it does does get the point


[00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:33,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m24s)

across so I think is mouse over oh so


[00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m31s)

this is going for oh this is using


[00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:46,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m33s)

selection okay so hold on let's go back


[00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:52,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m35s)

and see where is selection so de all the


[00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:56,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m46s)

way across that is pretty white to begin


[00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m52s)

with I'm not sure I want that at all


[00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m56s)

actually


[00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:03,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h36m58s)

so let's grab let's just change some of


[00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m01s)

this stuff up we're going to we're gonna


[00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m03s)

go crazy I don't want to trigger


[00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m05s)

onmouseover anymore


[00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m11s)

you know one second guys


[00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m20s)

you


[00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m27s)

okay sorry about that


[00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m29s)

wife was just asking questions about


[00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m32s)

kids and meds and what has been given


[00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m35s)

and what hasn't


[00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m36s)

okay so material design body is what


[00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:47,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m39s)

will fill the thumb with initially and


[00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:51,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m42s)

then I think what I want to do is rather


[00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:59,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m47s)

than having this guy do this we're gonna


[00:37:51,820 --> 00:38:01,869](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m51s)

do something like setter property I


[00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:09,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h37m59s)

think I want to keep playing with this a


[00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:11,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m01s)

little bit value 0.9 and then I think


[00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m09s)

let's just bring these down so I can see


[00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m11s)

what's going on here and height and


[00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:24,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m14s)

width should be together because they're


[00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:26,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m16s)

kind of related something like that


[00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m24s)

because the is dragging property gets


[00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m26s)

toggled as soon as the user clicks down


[00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:42,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m28s)

the mouse effectively when the scrollbar


[00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:48,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m31s)

thumb gains Mouse focus there huh are


[00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:52,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m42s)

they going lighter oh because I did my


[00:38:48,220 --> 00:39:02,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m48s)

things backwards should be more akin to


[00:38:52,030 --> 00:39:02,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h38m52s)

that back up


[00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m04s)

okay something's wrong so


[00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:20,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m13s)

mouse-over dragon


[00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:36,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m25s)

No what am i what am I thinking a city


[00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:39,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m29s)

of 1/5 is dragging true I don't have


[00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m36s)

anything up here that does anything


[00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:44,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m39s)

fancy there is an animation here versus


[00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m42s)

a straight up one there but those are


[00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m44s)

fairly quick so darker


[00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:58,839](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h39m55s)

design body


[00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m07s)

okay let's make this really really


[00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:16,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m09s)

obvious sometimes you just have to make


[00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m13s)

it really obvious you know


[00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m22s)

like he is over is not or the is


[00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m25s)

dragging is not triggering and I'm


[00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m27s)

wondering if it's


[00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m34s)

I'm wondering if sometimes the lives


[00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m36s)

amyl updating again it's great until


[00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:47,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m39s)

it's not and there's a very real chance


[00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:50,069](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m43s)

that that something didn't get updated


[00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m47s)

or occasionally you can get your your


[00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:55,049](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m50s)

app into broken invalid states because


[00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,819](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m52s)

it updates at kind of a halfway point


[00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:58,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m55s)

and because it's always just doing


[00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:02,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m56s)

transition transition transition


[00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h40m58s)

sometimes one of those transitions leave


[00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:08,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m02s)

stuff hanging around so it's really


[00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,589](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m06s)

great and then occasionally you just


[00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:13,259](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m08s)

need to reboot your app to make sure


[00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:21,599](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m10s)

that it really does look the way the


[00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:23,339](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m13s)

live editor claims I think okay well


[00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m21s)

that one's well that guy's thinking


[00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:28,049](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m23s)

about compiling here I want to go back


[00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,029](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m24s)

down and look at this scroll bar and see


[00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:37,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m28s)

what was done for these repeat buttons


[00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:41,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m30s)

scroll bar align button as I think it's


[00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:45,509](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m37s)

got here looking for how the how this


[00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:50,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m41s)

logic was done to see what we can do cuz


[00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:56,249](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m45s)

this has this is the corner radius there


[00:41:50,720 --> 00:42:07,009](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m50s)

the corner radius for the thumb that was


[00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:07,009](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h41m56s)

just tied in where why am I not P button


[00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:19,579](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m07s)

it's this style and that's just fixed I


[00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,579](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m15s)

think I want to cheat a little bit


[00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:31,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m23s)

okay something is not something is not


[00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:36,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m28s)

working for me so back to snoop we're


[00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:40,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m31s)

gonna figure out what's going on so we


[00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:45,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m36s)

know this visual state is working you


[00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:48,420](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m40s)

sit you sit there you sit here okay and


[00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m45s)

then protip the the best thing about


[00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m48s)

snoop once you get it attached to your


[00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:56,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m50s)

application if you can hover your cursor


[00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:59,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m54s)

over the control that you want to


[00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m56s)

inspect and then hold down control and


[00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h42m59s)

shift at the same time you'll notice you


[00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m02s)

get the little red selection rectangle


[00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m03s)

around it but more importantly it jumps


[00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:13,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m07s)

you straight into the visual tree at


[00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:17,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m09s)

that element so it is by far the fastest


[00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:21,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m13s)

navigation way to get around this so


[00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:25,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m17s)

definitely definitely use that okay so


[00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:30,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m21s)

we have this rectangle which is named


[00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:33,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m25s)

rectangle oh dang it


[00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:37,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m30s)

there's the bug as soon as I go and


[00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:42,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m33s)

explain it sure enough I have a setter


[00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:46,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m37s)

here but no target and so it doesn't


[00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:52,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m42s)

know where to apply it that's yeah


[00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:52,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m46s)

that's our problem so if we go here


[00:43:52,820 --> 00:44:03,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m52s)

pasady which it let me grab it we don't


[00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:03,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h43m55s)

see that guy going and then yep what is


[00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m03s)

it


[00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:11,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m03s)

that's the rectangle so if I look at the


[00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:13,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m06s)

thumb is dragging you can see that that


[00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:21,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m11s)

guy changes as soon as I click down on


[00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:23,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m13s)

it so that property is changing but this


[00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m21s)

is not okay


[00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m23s)

one more time and this time with feeling


[00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:32,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m25s)

and I think we'll be in better shape at


[00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m29s)

some point I I probably want to consider


[00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:38,369](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m32s)

changing these out to brushes


[00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:41,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m35s)

I'll need to go back and look at the WPF


[00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:45,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m38s)

they've got a wonderful page on


[00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m41s)

Microsoft Doc's about performance and I


[00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:52,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m45s)

can't there is there is some performance


[00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:56,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m48s)

implications with using transparency


[00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:59,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m52s)

like this and I can't remember which one


[00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:01,359](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m56s)

there's doing it with a brush versus the


[00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:03,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h44m59s)

opacity one of them hits performance


[00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m01s)

harder than the other and I'll need to


[00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m03s)

look at which one it is


[00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:11,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m04s)

because obviously I want to do the more


[00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,869](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m06s)

performant option even if that means


[00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m11s)

declaring another brush or possibly a


[00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:19,109](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m13s)

converter on an existing brush to just


[00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,109](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m15s)

toggle the alpha


[00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:32,829](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m25s)

come on buddy there you go okay open


[00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:36,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m31s)

there


[00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:43,029](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m32s)

oh that's there we go so now on the


[00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:46,599](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m36s)

click it's getting darker slightly


[00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:49,569](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m43s)

darker on hover more darker on drag okay


[00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m46s)

so that's obviously way too dark so now


[00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:55,359](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m49s)

we could go down to our I think


[00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:58,089](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m50s)

something more like that we'll let it


[00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:05,529](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m55s)

think about think about itself and re


[00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:08,009](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h45m58s)

update now we're talking now we're


[00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,009](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m05s)

talking


[00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:25,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m18s)

perfect perfect perfect perfect so now


[00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:31,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m22s)

the question is how close are we to this


[00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:32,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m25s)

so we're a little darker initially which


[00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m31s)

means we're a little darker straight


[00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m32s)

across the board so let's go back down


[00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:46,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m34s)

to here and let's just back it off a


[00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:46,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m38s)

little and see where does that bring us


[00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m47s)

still a hair on the dark side even on


[00:46:52,400 --> 00:47:02,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m52s)

both cases so we might lighten them both


[00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:05,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h46m54s)

up let's go with five there and like


[00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m02s)

that there


[00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m17s)

it's pretty close


[00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:30,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m21s)

my poor eyes the dark is still on the


[00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:38,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m28s)

hover is a little darker on our side


[00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:42,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m30s)

so let's not quite go that's far and


[00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m38s)

then something like that something like


[00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:53,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m42s)

that


[00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:55,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m43s)

there there scroll should have these


[00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:01,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m53s)

side by side I really want to compare


[00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:04,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h47m55s)

that color to that color that's probably


[00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m01s)

not worth splitting hairs over that's at


[00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:09,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m04s)

least so bigger about the exact color


[00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m07s)

later but that at least gives us that


[00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:15,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m09s)

gives us the look and feel that we were


[00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:17,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m11s)

going for with the animations so that'll


[00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m15s)

handle that I don't know why I thought


[00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:24,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m17s)

pressed was valid let's just take that


[00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m20s)

out there is


[00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:37,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m32s)

there's an issue with this disabled bid


[00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m38s)

I'm not entirely sure what to do about


[00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m43s)

it


[00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m43s)

so let's go here let's start with


[00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m45s)

something like this because generally


[00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:56,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m47s)

for disabled you go through and set an


[00:48:51,060 --> 00:49:00,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m51s)

opacity on it but I'm struggling to


[00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:03,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h48m56s)

decide what that what that should be so


[00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:06,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m00s)

we can look at sort of what just


[00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m03s)

simulate it real quick


[00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:15,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m06s)

so that's sort of what the disabled look


[00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:20,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m09s)

would be if we went with 2/3 want it to


[00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m15s)

be obvious it's still there just gone


[00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:35,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m22s)

for that's too much let's split the


[00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:37,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m28s)

difference yeah we'll go with that so I


[00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:42,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m35s)

think for now what we're just going to


[00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:48,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m37s)

do is this and this guy can go to the


[00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:56,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m42s)

back to is 5 that should get us close to


[00:49:48,460 --> 00:50:00,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m48s)

there okay so that that works that now


[00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:00,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h49m56s)

we have this issue here of this trigger


[00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:09,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m02s)

and I think I so one thing that that I


[00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:13,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m05s)

noticed that was done on this other one


[00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:18,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m09s)

is basically moves this the the setter


[00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:22,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m13s)

on these guys up and out


[00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:25,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m18s)

so this narrower look is nice but I


[00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:27,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m22s)

think I want to control that a little


[00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m25s)

differently because what is on the


[00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:34,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m27s)

scroll bar assist right now just arrow


[00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:35,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m29s)

visibility I think we're gonna I think


[00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m34s)

we're gonna play with that and expand


[00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m35s)

that a little bit because rather than


[00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:43,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m37s)

having this guy be hard-coded here I'd


[00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m39s)

like to to allow for a little bit easier


[00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m43s)

control which


[00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m44s)

and an attached property because


[00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:50,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m45s)

toggling that width feels like something


[00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:52,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m47s)

that somebody might want to do below


[00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m50s)

balae I know I've had to do it on


[00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:58,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m52s)

several apps where we had custom scroll


[00:50:54,190 --> 00:51:05,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m54s)

bars I think we're gonna go something


[00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:08,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h50m58s)

similar but I think what I like so do we


[00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:15,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m05s)

have material design horizontal scroll


[00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:17,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m08s)

bar I don't think we do just look here


[00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:21,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m15s)

real quick cuz I think like button has


[00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:25,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m17s)

control templates at the root trying to


[00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m21s)

remember if there's a suffix that we


[00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m25s)

normally attach on the naming schemes


[00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:32,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m27s)

for control templates that one doesn't


[00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m29s)

it Oh Calendar will certainly have


[00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m32s)

control templates question is are they


[00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:43,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m35s)

embedded in the style or are they


[00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:47,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m37s)

separated out no all embedded well where


[00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:53,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m43s)

else might I find them I think list box


[00:51:47,590 --> 00:52:02,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m47s)

perhaps has a bunch focus visual control


[00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:06,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h51m53s)

templates are all largely embedded well


[00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:09,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m02s)

maybe we do even embed it for now just


[00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:16,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m06s)

not sure I like having this this sort of


[00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:18,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m09s)

setup here but let's let's go through


[00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:21,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m16s)

and carry on our merry way so what are


[00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:24,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m18s)

you squawking about here no grid go


[00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:28,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m21s)

ahead and set it this isn't a big deal


[00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:30,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m24s)

this is just a resharper setting when


[00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:35,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m28s)

you have items in a grid it notices that


[00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:37,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m30s)

you have two elements and even though


[00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m35s)

grid column defaults to zero because


[00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:42,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m37s)

it's not the first element the rationale


[00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:45,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m40s)

is that it may not be intentional that


[00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:48,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m42s)

you've laid two elements effectively


[00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m45s)

right on top of each other so it wants


[00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:53,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m48s)

you to be explicit about which column


[00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:56,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m50s)

you're putting things in but in this


[00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m53s)

case that is fine


[00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:07,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h52m57s)

do you wonder what the point of this


[00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:16,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m00s)

border is why is this here it's sitting


[00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:20,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m07s)

on column one and I do not understand


[00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m16s)

its intent I'm gonna leave it for now


[00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m20s)

because I don't know why it's there but


[00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:28,839](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m22s)

I'm I'm hesitant to just yank it out


[00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:32,039](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m25s)

okay but the one thing that we do need


[00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:36,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m28s)

to do is grab this visual state manager


[00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:39,009](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m32s)

and bring it down to the grid as


[00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m36s)

conveniently they are named the same so


[00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:43,359](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m39s)

everything just works I'm gonna stop


[00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,799](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m41s)

execution just to get rid of these lines


[00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,799](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m43s)

basically because I don't have a


[00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:50,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m44s)

horizontal scrollbar


[00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:52,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m46s)

loaded right now the exam will edit and


[00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m50s)

continue can't find one to update so it


[00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:57,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m52s)

squawks at me and says hey this change


[00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m55s)

isn't gonna get applied anywhere you're


[00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:03,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m57s)

really sure that's what you meant


[00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:08,799](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h53m59s)

okay so that goes there that goes there


[00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:15,309](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m03s)

so the next question is how scroll bar


[00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:20,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m08s)

thumb so this guy applied a corner


[00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:25,829](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m15s)

radius I think what we might do is I


[00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:25,829](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m20s)

think I'm gonna because I I feel like I


[00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:33,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m27s)

feel like the the corner radius and the


[00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:36,339](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m30s)

width of the scroll bars are probably


[00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:38,319](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m33s)

less likely to be set indirectly I I


[00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:41,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m36s)

want to allow for the possibility of


[00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:43,599](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m38s)

people mixing and matching these rather


[00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:45,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m41s)

than just taking predefined defaults but


[00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,529](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m43s)

I also realized that most people are


[00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:52,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m45s)

probably going to take the predefined


[00:54:47,529 --> 00:55:01,089](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m47s)

defaults there's a little default here


[00:54:52,740 --> 00:55:04,779](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h54m52s)

our visibility it is and I soon this guy


[00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:07,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m01s)

sorry distracted distracted distracted


[00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:07,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m04s)

distracted


[00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:17,919](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m08s)

so that is fine that's fine okay so


[00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:17,919](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m13s)

let's do another attached property here


[00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:40,669](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m19s)

that's property and it is going to be of


[00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:47,599](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m24s)

type corner radius um something like


[00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:51,529](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m40s)

that yeah and corner radius I believe is


[00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,499](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m47s)

a struct which will default to zeros if


[00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:55,959](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m51s)

you don't do anything with it it is


[00:55:54,499 --> 00:55:59,059](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m54s)

perfect


[00:55:55,959 --> 00:56:07,039](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m55s)

so let's come back here to our scroll


[00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:10,059](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h55m59s)

bar so don't care about that chair


[00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m07s)

design scroll bar thumb vertical so how


[00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:17,019](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m10s)

how is it that this one was able to get


[00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:17,019](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m12s)

away with a single style for the thumb


[00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:26,209](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m20s)

but the other one has to sit okay so


[00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:29,509](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m23s)

what is the difference between some


[00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:32,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m26s)

vertical and thumb horizontal what's


[00:56:29,509 --> 00:56:35,169](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m29s)

going on here that's different


[00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:41,289](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m32s)

oh and we need to update both of these


[00:56:35,169 --> 00:56:41,289](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m35s)

so is tab stop


[00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:54,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m46s)

template type thumb there's the fill


[00:56:51,119 --> 00:57:03,449](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m51s)

color height with snap to pixels we did


[00:56:54,929 --> 00:57:06,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h56m54s)

the opacity and identical triggers boy


[00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:09,479](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m03s)

that really looks like duplicated styles


[00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:10,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m06s)

for no apparent reason okay so I assume


[00:57:09,479 --> 00:57:13,079](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m09s)

at one point these things might have


[00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:14,969](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m10s)

been so in the interest of not making a


[00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:19,439](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m13s)

breaking change what we're gonna do is


[00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:27,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m14s)

we are just going to do this like that


[00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:27,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m19s)

and then this guy becomes based on


[00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:47,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m36s)

scrollbar thump like that and so now


[00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:50,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m43s)

these guys will both pick up the changes


[00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:58,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m47s)

but I don't have to repeat myself on


[00:57:50,890 --> 00:58:01,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m50s)

either of these and we will leave both


[00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h57m58s)

of these styles for backwards


[00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:05,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m01s)

compatibility because if somebody else


[00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m03s)

is happening to reference these off in


[00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:10,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m05s)

their own app I don't want to break them


[00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:14,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m07s)

I wish there was a way to flag these as


[00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m10s)

obsolete but a comment will have to do


[00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m14s)

for now


[00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m15s)

obsolete


[00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,289](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m25s)

so


[00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m29s)

that way we don't break people if


[00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m32s)

somebody else is basing their styles on


[00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:42,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m33s)

these I suspect probably very few people


[00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:44,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m37s)

are and those that are probably re


[00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m42s)

templating their scroll bar anyway and


[00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m44s)

so it might not make a big difference


[00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:53,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m45s)

but we will we will do this so that


[00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:57,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m50s)

clears that that clears that that clears


[00:58:53,460 --> 00:59:01,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m53s)

that now we have a thumb working in both


[00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:08,099](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h58m57s)

positive and negative but what we want


[00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:10,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m01s)

to grab is we want to set a oh but we


[00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:13,349](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m08s)

can't quite do a corner radius here so


[00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:16,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m10s)

let's go back down and look was the


[00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:26,099](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m13s)

other one using a border rather than a


[00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:28,109](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m16s)

rectangle it was it was it was it was so


[00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:34,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m26s)

the border brush is kind of meaningless


[00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:41,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m28s)

with a border thickness of 0 we can do


[00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:44,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m34s)

that and we should probably rename this


[00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m41s)

as having this


[00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:59,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m51s)

that'll just break somebody later I'm


[00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:06,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m54s)

sure let's see and this becomes


[00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:09,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=00h59m59s)

background and then not what we wanted


[01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m06s)

to do thank you


[01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:30,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m18s)

okay so that'll get us there just to be


[01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:32,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m26s)

explicit we'll set that guy off to zero


[01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m30s)

just to make sure she's not accidentally


[01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:42,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m32s)

getting any thickness applied to him and


[01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:57,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m34s)

then we want our corner radius finding


[01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:57,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m42s)

path see scrollbar assist on a radius


[01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:06,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h00m59s)

fill that in for me thanks


[01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m03s)

but this guy I don't really want the


[01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:12,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m06s)

thumb corner so the two choices here are


[01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:18,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m08s)

make this attached property propagate


[01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:21,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m12s)

down or have this guy or just have this


[01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:25,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m18s)

thumb look back up to its scrollbar and


[01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:29,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m21s)

I think I like the latter because a


[01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m25s)

thumb outside of a scrollbar yeah it


[01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m29s)

doesn't make a lot of sense especially


[01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m30s)

if we're gonna be calling this scrollbar


[01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:40,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m32s)

thumb it should be inside of a scrollbar


[01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:43,619](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m33s)

so relative source relative source will


[01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:49,619](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m40s)

find our ancestor and we're gonna find


[01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:53,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m43s)

the first scrollbar so that's set on our


[01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:59,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m49s)

scrollbar we'll pick it up and grab it


[01:01:53,060 --> 01:02:03,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m53s)

so let's test this real quick and make


[01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:04,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h01m59s)

sure we can actually get this guy what


[01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:08,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m03s)

did I do


[01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:08,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m04s)

jiminy closing yeah


[01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:22,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m10s)

too many closings so let's look here


[01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:26,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m14s)

this is fine but let's do up some


[01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m22s)

symptoms copy I think we're just gonna


[01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m26s)

change the name on this real quick


[01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:47,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m39s)

and so this will be I don't know corner


[01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:51,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m43s)

radius and we'll just apply a universal


[01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:53,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m47s)

of five for now just so we get some nice


[01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:56,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m51s)

amount of corner radius but by having


[01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:58,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m53s)

this as a corner radius it allows


[01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m56s)

anybody who wants to go through if you


[01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:02,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h02m58s)

only want to say round one side and keep


[01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m00s)

the other side straight you are free to


[01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m02s)

do that


[01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:20,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m05s)

so let's go look at applying that and


[01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:23,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m09s)

our main demo app so main window I think


[01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:29,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m20s)

we might just do that same scroll bar


[01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:31,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m23s)

style like what was done initially in a


[01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:42,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m29s)

crack there we go


[01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:44,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m31s)

so do this sort of thing where we just


[01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:47,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m42s)

bring an implicit resource to change


[01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:54,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m44s)

this guy up so material design scroll


[01:03:47,970 --> 01:04:05,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m47s)

bar what I just just named it didn't I


[01:03:54,600 --> 01:04:07,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h03m54s)

rounded okay there let's fire this up


[01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:12,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m05s)

and at least make sure that that rounded


[01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:14,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m07s)

bit works and for reference I'm not


[01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m12s)

planning on leaving this rounded style


[01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:20,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m14s)

in but I think I'm gonna use it for now


[01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:22,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m16s)

just as a simple scroll bar target so we


[01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:27,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m20s)

can test our work as we go through this


[01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:30,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m22s)

I don't know if there is a good there's


[01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:32,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m27s)

not a good page on the the demo app


[01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:37,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m30s)

right now to show off the scroll bar and


[01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:39,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m32s)

these functionalities I may put in a


[01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m37s)

feature request if anybody wants to go


[01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:43,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m39s)

through and build that out it's not it's


[01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:46,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m41s)

not terribly difficult to do it's fairly


[01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m43s)

straightforward so if anybody's looking


[01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:50,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m46s)

to kind of get their feet wet and see


[01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:56,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m48s)

about doing a pull request to the


[01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:58,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m50s)

library that would be a great start come


[01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:04,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m56s)

on little buddy you can do this


[01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:09,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h04m58s)

I know it's hard updates available it's


[01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:12,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m04s)

always exciting I know I've mentioned


[01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:15,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m09s)

this on Prior streams but do be aware


[01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m12s)

it's not likely to happen in the two six


[01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:20,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m15s)

oh release but sometimes shortly


[01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m17s)

thereafter when we go to dotnet core


[01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m20s)

three support in this library it will be


[01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m23s)

requiring


[01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:32,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m24s)

latest versions of Visual Studio and


[01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:34,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m26s)

obviously the latest version of.net to


[01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m32s)

be installed which is currently going to


[01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m34s)

be preview releases in order to compile


[01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:40,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m35s)

the library from source so just be aware


[01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m38s)

that in order to add that support we


[01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m40s)

have to have the that tooling installed


[01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:53,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m42s)

so that's going to become a requirement


[01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:54,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m44s)

look at that rounded corners sweet just


[01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:59,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m53s)

like we planned it


[01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:02,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m54s)

if we set this guy back to a zero and


[01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:08,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h05m59s)

wait for it to update thinking thinking


[01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:11,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m02s)

thinking thinking thinking that did not


[01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m08s)

update as expected


[01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:18,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m14s)

it's relaunch and just make sure because


[01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:20,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m16s)

I do want to make sure that this feature


[01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m18s)

is working before I get too carried away


[01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m20s)

and then I think I'm just going to bring


[01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:30,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m22s)

this setter up here and verify that we


[01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:33,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m24s)

can do the same thing with the repeat


[01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:37,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m30s)

buttons hidden I'm wondering if arrows


[01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:39,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m33s)

visibility makes sense because arrow


[01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:42,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m37s)

implies the content of the repeat button


[01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:50,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m39s)

and the buttons may or may not have


[01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:52,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m42s)

arrows always interesting mmm naming


[01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:58,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m50s)

things is one of the hardest hardest


[01:06:52,800 --> 01:07:00,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m52s)

bits and I am never 100% sold on name so


[01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h06m58s)

if people have better suggestions for


[01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m00s)

names or things that are confusing I


[01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m02s)

would very much love to either hear a


[01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:09,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m04s)

comment in the Gator chat or an issue


[01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:12,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m06s)

opened so we can discuss because I again


[01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:14,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m09s)

Namie naming is hard and I don't


[01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m12s)

necessarily think that the names I come


[01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:28,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m14s)

up with especially at this hour of the


[01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:33,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m16s)

evening are always the best okay so


[01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:37,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m28s)

let's get this guy going that still has


[01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:39,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m33s)

rounded corners that worries me because


[01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:44,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m37s)

corner radius should have been zeroed


[01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:49,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m39s)

out so back to snoop let's figure out


[01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:52,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m44s)

what's going on see there I've got the


[01:07:49,110 --> 01:08:00,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m49s)

wrong let's just start with the obvious


[01:07:52,760 --> 01:08:03,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h07m52s)

no I'm pointed at the right style oh oh


[01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:07,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m00s)

but this guy is based on the wrong style


[01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:10,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m03s)

that'll do it so turn that guy back off


[01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:16,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m07s)

so I may have set it to the right style


[01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:18,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m10s)

but I based it on the wrong style so


[01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:21,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m16s)

snoop thank you but I don't think I need


[01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m18s)

you anymore


[01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:29,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m22s)

and probably a bit confused okay so


[01:08:24,449 --> 01:08:30,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m24s)

there no corner radius okay should have


[01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m29s)

tested my animations to make sure it


[01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:40,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m30s)

worked


[01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:42,420](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m31s)

I said a5 reapply and we'll just betta


[01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,859](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m40s)

yeah the fact that the scrollbar was


[01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:48,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m42s)

narrow should have been another dead


[01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:51,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m43s)

giveaway from me okay so there there is


[01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m48s)

it with the corner radius applied if you


[01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:58,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m51s)

want the little rounded tips at the top


[01:08:53,730 --> 01:09:03,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m53s)

and bottom on your scroll bars cool so


[01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:07,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h08m58s)

let's bring this guy up now I don't


[01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,839](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m03s)

expect this to do anything because we


[01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:13,319](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m07s)

have nothing in our old templates that's


[01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:18,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m09s)

watching for that but what we can do is


[01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:20,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m13s)

come back over to our scroll bar style


[01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:27,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m18s)

and we can go and bind these buttons to


[01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:32,489](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m20s)

them so material design scroll bar


[01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:34,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m27s)

button I think I just take advantage of


[01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:36,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m32s)

the fact that these things are all using


[01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:43,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m34s)

the same style even in the horizontal


[01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:51,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m36s)

right yeah I think we can just leverage


[01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:55,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m43s)

this this same style so like we just do


[01:09:51,989 --> 01:10:01,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m51s)

a setter right here and call it a day


[01:09:55,250 --> 01:10:04,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h09m55s)

property visibility and the value will


[01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:08,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m01s)

once again be a relative binding so


[01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:14,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m04s)

binding paths do the parens for the


[01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:17,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m08s)

attached property WPF scrollbar assist


[01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:20,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m14s)

we have a scroll viewer a system might


[01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:23,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m17s)

want to check that arrow visibility and


[01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m20s)

then we are going to go and once again


[01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:29,969](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m23s)

grabs this off of our scroll bar because


[01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:31,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m27s)

this is a scroll bar button so this


[01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:32,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m29s)

thing being used outside of a scroll bar


[01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:38,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m31s)

doesn't make a lot


[01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:40,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m32s)

sense see ancestor type scrollbar and


[01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:45,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m38s)

let's just check that guy real quick I


[01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:48,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m40s)

don't think he was set to propagate no


[01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,639](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m45s)

to do the propagation you basically have


[01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:55,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m48s)

to I believe you set framework property


[01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:58,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m50s)

metadata and then there's an enum for


[01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:00,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m55s)

behaviors and you can set


[01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:03,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h10m58s)

I think it's called inherits I'm not


[01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:09,139](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m00s)

mistaken and then I need to close my


[01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:09,139](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m03s)

setter okay that guy


[01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:19,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m12s)

yeah he's confused we're gonna relaunch


[01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:22,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m16s)

hopefully now our scrollbar still has


[01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:29,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m19s)

that kind of mildly rounded view but


[01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:31,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m22s)

then no buttons I'm wondering if given


[01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:35,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m29s)

that this is on scrollbar assist if


[01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:40,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m31s)

rather than arrows visibility is buttons


[01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:41,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m35s)

visibility clean it clear enough so


[01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:46,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m40s)

again I go back and forth on what the


[01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:49,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m41s)

appropriate name is for these things on


[01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:53,909](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m46s)

a scroll bar would you call it a button


[01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:55,469](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m49s)

I mean it's it's functionally a repeat


[01:11:53,909 --> 01:12:01,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m53s)

button but I'm wondering if button


[01:11:55,469 --> 01:12:05,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h11m55s)

visibility makes sense that might be


[01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:08,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m01s)

slightly cleaner than arrow visibility I


[01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:08,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m05s)

think


[01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:22,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m09s)

maybe but invisibility arrow visibility


[01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:24,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m15s)

repeat but invisibility probably it


[01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m22s)

probably should be it probably should


[01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m24s)

definitely end invisibility to match the


[01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:35,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m26s)

property that we're targeting with it


[01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:35,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m28s)

Hey look at that repeat buttons gone oh


[01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:42,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m37s)

but that's a little disconcerting I


[01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:47,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m40s)

would have expected the scrollbar to


[01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:57,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m42s)

actually be able to go top to bottom


[01:12:47,700 --> 01:13:02,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m47s)

which it's not okay so that is not quite


[01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:05,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h12m57s)

right so once again let's go back to our


[01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:08,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m02s)

old pal snoop and figure out why is my


[01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:20,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m05s)

track not filling that space


[01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:23,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m08s)

Oh that'll well that's max height okay


[01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:27,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m20s)

with max height because that would mean


[01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:30,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m23s)

that men should be zero which its


[01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:33,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m27s)

content is collapsed at the moment so I


[01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:36,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m30s)

would expect it to be zero jump me here


[01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:41,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m33s)

okay so there's that and there are the


[01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:46,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m36s)

two repeat buttons that's inside of the


[01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:50,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m41s)

track let's see so there is our grid


[01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:56,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m46s)

line up button is hidden height and


[01:13:50,530 --> 01:14:03,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m50s)

width of zero track down button height


[01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:09,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h13m56s)

them with the zero okay so my question


[01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:11,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m03s)

is why liking that track so the grid


[01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:14,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m09s)

itself that contains everything as a


[01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:17,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m11s)

height of six sixty if we look at our


[01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:20,159](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m14s)

track six to six something is getting


[01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:25,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m17s)

space allocated to it


[01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:28,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m20s)

and the two road definitions are not


[01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:36,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m25s)

collapsing to zero like I would have


[01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:45,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m28s)

expected them to now the question is why


[01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:53,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m36s)

so let's take a look at their height min


[01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:58,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m45s)

height zero Oh interesting so it's


[01:14:53,070 --> 01:15:04,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m53s)

getting a height of star I think okay so


[01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:04,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h14m58s)

I think what we just do is height:auto


[01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:21,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m08s)

to let them collapse now we've got a


[01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:23,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m16s)

track that fills the entire length so


[01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:24,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m21s)

apparently our ListView doesn't go all


[01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:28,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m23s)

the way to the bottom there's some


[01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:31,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m24s)

amount of space on the end but our thumb


[01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:34,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m28s)

is able to traverse the whole stack okay


[01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:37,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m31s)

that makes me feel better but let's


[01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:46,429](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m34s)

let's turn them back on to make sure


[01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:51,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m37s)

that still works visible going update


[01:15:46,429 --> 01:15:54,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m46s)

thinking thinking thinking okay so now


[01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m51s)

there's our buttons back great and yeah


[01:15:54,750 --> 01:16:01,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m54s)

the buttons do cut off before we get all


[01:15:57,659 --> 01:16:06,719](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h15m57s)

the way to the bottom does bother me the


[01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:10,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m01s)

buttons don't seem to have a mouse down


[01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:14,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m06s)

effect on them let's check that other


[01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:18,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m10s)

one I think this is likely due to this


[01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:20,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m14s)

is probably just Chrome doing that it


[01:16:18,989 --> 01:16:24,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m18s)

would be really nice to have a similar


[01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:29,639](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m20s)

effect on those buttons but it might be


[01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:31,889](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m24s)

a task for another day okay so that that


[01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:33,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m29s)

works and then in the rare case where


[01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:35,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m31s)

somebody


[01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:38,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m33s)

wants to hide them but still keep the


[01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:42,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m35s)

scroll bar in the same position I can't


[01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:45,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m38s)

think of a use case right now but that


[01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m42s)

does block it because the actual


[01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:49,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m45s)

containing grid


[01:16:46,409 --> 01:16:52,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m46s)

it's bigger opened back up please yeah


[01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:53,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m49s)

so that there is a little space top and


[01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:57,719](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m52s)

bottom for where those buttons would be


[01:16:53,460 --> 01:17:01,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m53s)

okay so that is fine but we need to fix


[01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:05,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h16m57s)

it this fixed it or I should say this


[01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:06,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m01s)

Auto change here only fixes it for the


[01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:11,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m05s)

vertical scrollbar and we have


[01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:17,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m06s)

horizontal to think about too so it'll


[01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:27,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m11s)

be a similar change of auto there with


[01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:32,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m17s)

Auto there okay so and I think I'm gonna


[01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:36,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m27s)

rename this to be minimal alright okay


[01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:37,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m32s)

so that's obviously gonna break the


[01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:39,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m36s)

universe because this is the style that


[01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:41,489](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m37s)

I want the name that I want to end up


[01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:43,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m39s)

with basically moving minimal from the


[01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:46,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m41s)

middle to the end that way in your


[01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:48,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m43s)

intellisense if you type material design


[01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,719](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m46s)

scroll bar minimal x' the next thing


[01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:55,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m48s)

that shows up and away you go okay so


[01:17:51,719 --> 01:18:01,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m51s)

that gets us into a nice scroll bar


[01:17:55,830 --> 01:18:05,429](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h17m55s)

situation I think at least with in terms


[01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:08,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m01s)

of this and this so the last feature I


[01:18:05,429 --> 01:18:11,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m05s)

believe we wanted was some ability via


[01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:14,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m08s)

the style to effectively configure the


[01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:18,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m11s)

size so you'll notice in the original


[01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:21,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m14s)

change before I butchered it this guy is


[01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:24,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m18s)

actually quite a bit narrower than the


[01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:29,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m21s)

the default scroll bar so this is


[01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:31,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m24s)

somewhat a deviation like it follows it


[01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:33,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m29s)

follows the design of a lot of them like


[01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:35,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m31s)

the old Google Hangouts app had a


[01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:38,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m33s)

thinner scroll bar on the side it didn't


[01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:41,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m35s)

have the rounded edges and several of


[01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:43,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m38s)

them do shrink the with a little bit but


[01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:46,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m41s)

in here we're defaulting to pulling the


[01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:47,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m43s)

size off the system default which means


[01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:50,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m46s)

it's essentially the same as what's in


[01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:55,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m47s)

Visual Studio here is your scroll bar


[01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:57,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m50s)

has a default system parameter so we


[01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m55s)

should definitely use the the system


[01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:01,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m57s)

parameter as our default however I don't


[01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:04,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h18m59s)

want to preclude somebody from changing


[01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:08,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m01s)

it so the first question is do we have a


[01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:08,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m04s)

separate property for height and width


[01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:18,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m08s)

probably probably as much as I I I can


[01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m16s)

do a single one with like scroll bar


[01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:23,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m18s)

size but that just that feels a little


[01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:26,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m21s)

too ambiguous as far as what its


[01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:29,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m23s)

intention is supposed to be so let's


[01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m26s)

let's do two two attached properties I


[01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:45,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m29s)

think I think that'll that'll probably


[01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:45,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m31s)

work out better so double scroll bar ooh


[01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:53,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m45s)

actually it's not really scroll bar I


[01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h19m48s)

think we should call this thumb width


[01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:08,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m01s)

the only part that's that's giving me


[01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:11,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m03s)

pause is thumb width works but if we


[01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:14,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m08s)

have thumb width and thumb height is it


[01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:16,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m11s)

going to be confusing to people that for


[01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:19,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m14s)

example thumb height isn't going to have


[01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:22,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m16s)

any effect one on a vertical scrollbar


[01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:26,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m19s)

because obviously the scrollbar should


[01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m22s)

reflect the amount of the contents that


[01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,489](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m26s)

its scrolling through not necessarily


[01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:33,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m27s)

the size that you set here I'm going to


[01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:35,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m31s)

code it this way for now but no promises


[01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m33s)

that this doesn't change this feels like


[01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:41,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m35s)

an awkward an awkward API that needs to


[01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:43,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m38s)

be cleaned up so if anybody in the chat


[01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:44,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m41s)

has feedback on what would make what


[01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:48,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m43s)

they think would make it cleaner I


[01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:56,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m44s)

definitely would love to hear it I don't


[01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:57,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m48s)

see here so some width um height and so


[01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m56s)

then the question is how do we want to


[01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:02,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h20m57s)

toggle which one were using


[01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:19,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m11s)

because this is just pulling a dynamic


[01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:22,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m14s)

resource off this key so this is just


[01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:28,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m19s)

creating a resource key do we change up


[01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:39,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m22s)

to a change up of value and a resource


[01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:43,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m28s)

key and I know that feels wrong yeah


[01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:44,949](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m39s)

because if you want to change the width


[01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:46,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m43s)

of the scroll bar that's fine but


[01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:48,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m44s)

ultimately what we're talking about


[01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:51,489](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m46s)

wanting to do is change the size of the


[01:21:48,849 --> 01:21:53,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m48s)

thumb within it because down here the


[01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:58,139](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m51s)

old one or I should say the one that was


[01:21:53,199 --> 01:22:02,889](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m53s)

done here where it was a smaller thumb


[01:21:58,139 --> 01:22:09,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h21m58s)

did to do where was that done there's


[01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:16,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m02s)

that thumb there is declared and has a


[01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:19,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m09s)

Whitsett on it so on ours up here I've


[01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:23,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m16s)

got a track we've got a thumb and we


[01:22:19,989 --> 01:22:29,099](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m19s)

could set it here or we could set oh I


[01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:33,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m23s)

should I should switch you off of this


[01:22:29,099 --> 01:22:35,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m29s)

because I would like to remove all let


[01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:38,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m33s)

me just hunt the library real quick I


[01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:39,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m35s)

want to make sure if I'm declaring this


[01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:41,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m38s)

is obsolete that we aren't using it


[01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:43,869](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m39s)

anywhere else in the library and instead


[01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:46,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m41s)

using the new base style I suspect in


[01:22:43,869 --> 01:22:49,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m43s)

line in this file is the only place


[01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:52,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m46s)

these are used directly and this one


[01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:55,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m49s)

should have two usages one here and then


[01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:57,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m52s)

what I'm about to go replace because


[01:22:55,480 --> 01:23:00,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m55s)

there should be one down for the


[01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:03,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h22m57s)

horizontal scrollbar thumb that was


[01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:08,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m00s)

being done yeah so this guy right here


[01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:08,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m03s)

so find results find results


[01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:15,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m10s)

yeah only those two perfect


[01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:17,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m13s)

so we'll just we'll just deprecated


[01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:24,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m15s)

those styles in favor of our new one


[01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:29,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m17s)

okay so these are those to repeat


[01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:32,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m24s)

buttons that effectively exist so on the


[01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:37,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m29s)

scroll bar that the empty area between


[01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:41,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m32s)

the thumb and the actual up/down buttons


[01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:43,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m37s)

are technically hidden repeat buttons so


[01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:48,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m41s)

that when you click on that area it


[01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:59,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m43s)

automatically does it jump question then


[01:23:48,850 --> 01:24:03,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m48s)

is this guy I think this is fine to just


[01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:06,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h23m59s)

bind it right here well let's do let's


[01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m03s)

do the vertical one first that way we


[01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:13,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m06s)

can test it and then go from there I


[01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:18,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m09s)

think what we do is here we do with


[01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:26,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m13s)

binding and I think we can get away


[01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:32,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m18s)

actually so path once again WPF and then


[01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:33,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m26s)

scrollbar assist this is the vertical


[01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m32s)

one so we're going to be binding the


[01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:40,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m33s)

width and then because we're actually


[01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:43,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m35s)

sitting inside of a control template I


[01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:47,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m40s)

believe we can just do a relative source


[01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:49,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m43s)

relative source template parent because


[01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:52,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m47s)

we're going to be looking for this


[01:24:49,210 --> 01:25:00,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m49s)

attached property applied to the


[01:24:52,810 --> 01:25:03,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h24m52s)

scrollbar itself it should that's a long


[01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:05,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m00s)

line I'm just gonna drop that down and


[01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:09,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m03s)

make that fit on my screen okay so let's


[01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:13,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m05s)

go down and test this guy again our fun


[01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:17,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m09s)

little option so I'm gonna go with


[01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:21,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m13s)

collapsed for now and then let's see


[01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:26,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m17s)

rather narrow visibility thumb width


[01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:28,899](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m21s)

value 5 something actually let's do this


[01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:31,689](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m26s)

buy you 10 that way with our corner


[01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:35,559](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m28s)

radius we get a perfectly rounded top


[01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:43,689](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m31s)

and bottom edge let's make sure this


[01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:46,539](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m35s)

works and if this works we will just


[01:25:43,689 --> 01:25:50,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m43s)

apply the same thing on the horizontal


[01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:58,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m46s)

scrollbar and then I think we'll just


[01:25:50,679 --> 01:26:00,489](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m50s)

about have all the features we wanted so


[01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:04,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h25m58s)

then a little cleanup of some of this


[01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:07,689](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m00s)

other stuff and then we will push it and


[01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:11,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m04s)

get it merged into the two 6s which is


[01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:11,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m07s)

effectively latest on the master branch


[01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:17,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m12s)

if if somebody wants to help out and


[01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m16s)

you're a little unsure about coding


[01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:23,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m17s)

something that I always appreciate if


[01:26:20,769 --> 01:26:27,639](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m20s)

you want to download the latest nightly


[01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:29,019](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m23s)

builds off of nougat and start testing


[01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:31,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m27s)

out some of the new features or the


[01:26:29,019 --> 01:26:32,199](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m29s)

changed areas that would be incredibly


[01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:34,959](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m31s)

helpful


[01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:36,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m32s)

I always appreciate it when people test


[01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:40,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m34s)

the new builds and we can find bugs


[01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:42,399](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m36s)

before shipping something out


[01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,499](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m40s)

material design scroll bar around it


[01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:47,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m42s)

that is because it is no longer called


[01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:53,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m44s)

rounded anymore I renamed it and then


[01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:53,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m47s)

did not fix it on my main window


[01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:13,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h26m57s)

try it and for people who haven't seen


[01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:20,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m07s)

this kind of work before it's so with


[01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:22,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m13s)

WPF you can actually inject and in a


[01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:26,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m20s)

sense override the styles that are being


[01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:29,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m22s)

used so anything that's using a dynamic


[01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:29,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m26s)

resource or is implicitly being resolved


[01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:32,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m29s)

by its type


[01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m29s)

like for example scroll bars there the


[01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:36,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m32s)

style that's applied to them is an


[01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:39,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m33s)

implicit style based upon this control


[01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:45,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m36s)

type excuse me


[01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:48,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m39s)

the by declaring this style here in the


[01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:52,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m45s)

listbox resources it will get found


[01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:54,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m48s)

prior what so when the list box goes to


[01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:56,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m52s)

look up its scroll bar the the style for


[01:27:54,440 --> 01:28:00,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m54s)

its scroll bar it effectively walks back


[01:27:56,330 --> 01:28:02,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h27m56s)

up the the tree looking for a style for


[01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:04,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m00s)

this and so it'll it'll walk up and


[01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:06,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m02s)

it'll find this one first if this one's


[01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m04s)

not here it'll keep walking its way up


[01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:10,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m06s)

it'll hit the window won't find anything


[01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:12,469](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m07s)

in the window jump over to the app dot


[01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:14,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m10s)

zamel and look there and that's where


[01:28:12,469 --> 01:28:16,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m12s)

it'll find the the merge dictionaries


[01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:18,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m14s)

for say things like the material design


[01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:21,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m16s)

in zamel library and then resolve the


[01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:23,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m18s)

scroll bar type the same thing can be


[01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m21s)

done in a lot of cases if you're looking


[01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:29,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m23s)

for a way to override colors in the


[01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:31,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m26s)

library I believe I hope everywhere


[01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m29s)

we're using dynamic resources for the


[01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:37,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m31s)

colors so that they respond to theme


[01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:40,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m34s)

changes so that means that if you want


[01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:43,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m37s)

to hijack a color you can just declare a


[01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:45,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m40s)

brush inside of resource that's at a


[01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:47,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m43s)

closer level to the element you want to


[01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:50,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m45s)

change then your app dot zamel and


[01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:54,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m47s)

everything underneath that will get that


[01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:59,719](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m50s)

that it'll resolve to that brush instead


[01:28:54,160 --> 01:29:04,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m54s)

ok back over here nicely rounded corners


[01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:07,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h28m59s)

and a nice even scrollbar I like it I


[01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:07,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m04s)

like it I like it


[01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:13,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m09s)

so if we wanted to go with a nice


[01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:15,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m11s)

minimalist style I don't think the


[01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:17,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m13s)

minimalist style is going to have the


[01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:22,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m15s)

the rounded corners on it I think by


[01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:25,970](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m17s)

default we jump back over here I think


[01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:29,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m22s)

what's probably going to happen is the


[01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:30,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m25s)

minimalist style is gonna probably ship


[01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:38,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m29s)

looking something like this


[01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:43,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m30s)

I think that's I think that's probably


[01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:46,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m38s)

the case that's pretty close to where -


[01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:48,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m43s)

the way I've seen a lot of a lot of the


[01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:50,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m46s)

scroll bars for material design because


[01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:52,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m48s)

different libraries have done different


[01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:54,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m50s)

implementations of the scroll bar and I


[01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m52s)

think this has been one of the more


[01:29:54,110 --> 01:30:00,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m54s)

common ones I think the width may


[01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:04,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h29m56s)

actually even be slightly narrower I'm


[01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:07,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m00s)

hesitant to so there is a fun trick like


[01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:11,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m04s)

the the that might be too narrow and go


[01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:15,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m07s)

back to the 10 the the fluent design so


[01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:19,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m11s)

Microsoft's design paradigm that they've


[01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:22,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m15s)

put out for like you WP apps they


[01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:25,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m19s)

actually have their built in scroll bar


[01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:28,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m22s)

collapses down to only a few pixels wide


[01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:30,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m25s)

until you mouse over it and then you get


[01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:32,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m28s)

the nice wide scroll bar to interact


[01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:34,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m30s)

with so if somebody wanted to go and


[01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:36,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m32s)

implement that having these types of


[01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:38,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m34s)

properties here would allow that so that


[01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:41,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m36s)

you could write your own trigger and


[01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:44,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m38s)

effectively toggle this property to get


[01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:48,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m41s)

that that look so back up here we need


[01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:52,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m44s)

to apply effectively this same thing


[01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:57,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m48s)

here to the horizontal one only for the


[01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:59,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m52s)

height so we're gonna go down here


[01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:02,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m57s)

rather than width we're gonna do height


[01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:06,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h30m59s)

rather than some width we're gonna do


[01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:09,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m02s)

some height and that should fix that


[01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:09,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m06s)

okay


[01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:25,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m10s)

so I think we're gonna go with that okay


[01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:30,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m15s)

so let's do that out that there's no


[01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:32,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m25s)

longer used these controls are no longer


[01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:36,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m30s)

control templates are no longer used


[01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:41,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m32s)

this scroll bar thumb is no longer used


[01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:48,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m36s)

so there's that let's move up move up


[01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:51,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m41s)

move up move up scroll bar repeat button


[01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:57,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m48s)

scroll bar repeat button okay there's


[01:31:51,640 --> 01:32:00,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m51s)

that because this guy's effectively just


[01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:05,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h31m57s)

a straight-up transparent button yeah


[01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:08,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m00s)

literally doesn't show up at all scroll


[01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:11,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m05s)

bar page button scroll bar line button


[01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:13,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m08s)

what is the difference here where are


[01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m11s)

you used


[01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:28,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m20s)

interesting scroll or line button is not


[01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:31,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m23s)

used at all which begs the question then


[01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:35,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m28s)

was it something that was added by this


[01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:41,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m31s)

pull request or was this something new


[01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:45,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m35s)

let's let's take a quick look here so if


[01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:52,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m41s)

we bring this pull request back over


[01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:58,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m45s)

let's see here pull requests just grab


[01:32:52,880 --> 01:33:08,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m52s)

that guy real quick because if the


[01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:14,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h32m58s)

wondering if this needs to be minimal


[01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:16,850](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m08s)

scroll bar yeah new one to avoid


[01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:19,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m14s)

conflicts but we're not going to use the


[01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:23,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m16s)

new one so let's just look at the files


[01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:24,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m19s)

changed because this one this pull


[01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:26,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m23s)

request hasn't been updated with any


[01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:30,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m24s)

changes that we've done tonight so


[01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m26s)

everything in here is new changes so


[01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:40,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m30s)

this is just a lot of white space


[01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:44,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m32s)

cleanup just fine there we go


[01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:46,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m40s)

hide white space changes I really don't


[01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m44s)

I really don't care that much I usually


[01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:51,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m46s)

just eyeball white space changes to make


[01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,420](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m48s)

sure that they aren't atrocious but


[01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:56,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m51s)

usually when I see white space changes


[01:33:53,420 --> 01:34:01,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m53s)

it's because somebody has just ah so it


[01:33:56,870 --> 01:34:03,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h33m56s)

was added here got it because he


[01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:09,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m01s)

effectively needed the same type of one


[01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:09,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m03s)

here but then ended up using that anyway


[01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:17,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m09s)

curious scrollbar line button


[01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:30,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m18s)

so that's where that guy you used got it


[01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:33,059](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m28s)

but we whacked that control template so


[01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:36,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m30s)

that shouldn't matter now okay perfect


[01:34:33,059 --> 01:34:40,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m33s)

so we can get rid of this guy and that


[01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:45,270](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m36s)

is no longer necessary so fewer code is


[01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:48,869](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m40s)

usually better code scroll bar page


[01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:52,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m45s)

button now I'm curious if this is the


[01:34:48,869 --> 01:34:56,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m48s)

one that's actually used if this one was


[01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:59,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m52s)

added yeah cuz this is the repeat button


[01:34:56,730 --> 01:35:02,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m56s)

transparent so this was added with the


[01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:07,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h34m59s)

other one as well let's just confirm


[01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:10,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m02s)

that real quick yes it was okay so we


[01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:14,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m07s)

have all of these prefixed with material


[01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:17,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m10s)

design so those match this repeat button


[01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:20,579](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m14s)

transparent these two are going to


[01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:22,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m17s)

ultimately deprecated and get removed in


[01:35:20,579 --> 01:35:26,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m20s)

favor of the common style because we


[01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:29,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m22s)

have no reason to not use a single one


[01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:32,039](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m26s)

we've got some fancy new attached


[01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:37,349](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m29s)

properties I do think I want to rename


[01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:41,449](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m32s)

this Aero visibility I think I want to


[01:35:37,349 --> 01:35:44,639](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m37s)

go with buttons visibility for now I


[01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:52,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m41s)

think that so far that's the best name


[01:35:44,639 --> 01:36:00,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m44s)

I've come up with so just walk them all


[01:35:52,770 --> 01:36:02,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h35m52s)

yeah do it thanks because I think that's


[01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:07,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m00s)

that's again that's the best name I've


[01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:08,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m02s)

got and so hopefully that works out so


[01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:10,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m07s)

the one other area I want to test so


[01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:13,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m08s)

there is some implicit scroll bars on a


[01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:18,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m10s)

couple other controls so specifically in


[01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:19,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m13s)

areas like the data grid it has a scroll


[01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:21,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m18s)

viewer built on and I just want to


[01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:25,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m19s)

confirm that the changes that we've done


[01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:29,389](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m21s)

don't accidentally break the fact that


[01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:29,389](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m25s)

I've I've whacked all of these


[01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:35,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m30s)

storyboards off of the scroll viewer


[01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:38,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m33s)

which is again one level up from the


[01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:42,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m35s)

scrollbar itself


[01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:50,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m38s)

so hopefully that comes through a little


[01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:50,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m42s)

nicer come on go there's your studio go


[01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:59,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m53s)

so for those people who are not familiar


[01:36:57,030 --> 01:37:01,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m57s)

there's a concept called rubber duck


[01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:03,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h36m59s)

debugging and I've heard various


[01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:05,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m01s)

versions of the story float around


[01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:08,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m03s)

online but it usually goes something


[01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:12,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m05s)

along the lines of developer goes to his


[01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:15,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m08s)

boss with a question boss gives him the


[01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m12s)

answer send him back to work a little


[01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:19,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m15s)

while later he comes back asked another


[01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:21,310](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m16s)

question you know boss being gracious


[01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:22,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m19s)

gives him gives him the answer again and


[01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:26,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m21s)

sends him back to work and then


[01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:28,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m22s)

ultimately by the third time when he


[01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:32,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m26s)

asked the question the boss gets smart


[01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:33,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m28s)

and hands him a rubber duck and tells


[01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:36,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m32s)

him ok next time before you come and ask


[01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:39,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m33s)

me a question explain your problem to


[01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:41,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m36s)

the duck and if you still don't know the


[01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:45,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m39s)

answer after explaining it to the duck


[01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:47,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m41s)

then come and ask me and it is shocking


[01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:53,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m45s)

how many times simply explaining your


[01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:56,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m47s)

problem out loud ends up quote-unquote


[01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:58,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m53s)

fixing the problem these guys are not


[01:37:56,710 --> 01:38:03,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m56s)

going to show a scrollbar which is


[01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:07,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h37m58s)

problematic and more importantly this


[01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:09,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m03s)

scrollbar isn't showing at all which is


[01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:14,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m07s)

also problematic so there is a scroll


[01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:16,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m09s)

bar here which is great but it is is


[01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:21,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m14s)

coming up empty so we have broken


[01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:23,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m16s)

something let's figure out what so I


[01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:26,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m21s)

don't necessarily always have a rubber


[01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:28,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m23s)

duck but in exchange I'll usually just


[01:38:26,410 --> 01:38:31,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m26s)

talk to Visual Studio directly because


[01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:33,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m28s)

it's always better to confide your


[01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:35,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m31s)

mistakes and an inanimate thing like


[01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:39,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m33s)

Visual Studio that can't repeat them to


[01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:40,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m35s)

anyone else so in my case I'm doing it


[01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:42,430](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m39s)

on a live stream so I guess there's


[01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:45,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m40s)

video evidence of


[01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:48,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m42s)

of my mistakes but it's still helpful


[01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:52,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m45s)

and if anyone ever wants a virtual


[01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:55,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m48s)

rubber duck rubber duck debugging com


[01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:58,450](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m52s)

wonderful little rubber duck and you can


[01:38:55,300 --> 01:39:01,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m55s)

even chat with a duck if you'd like the


[01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:03,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h38m58s)

duck is the duck on the website is about


[01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m01s)

as helpful as a regular rubber duck


[01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:10,240](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m03s)

would be okay


[01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:13,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m05s)

scrollbar we broke something so let's


[01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:19,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m10s)

take a look here sure I assume it's


[01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:28,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m13s)

going to be down here okay


[01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:33,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m19s)

thumb has a color there is the problem


[01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:35,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m28s)

so problem we have inadvertently


[01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:39,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m33s)

introduced as our attached properties


[01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:45,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m35s)

are defaulting to zero as most numeric


[01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:47,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m39s)

types do and then promptly breaking us


[01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:53,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m45s)

[Music]


[01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:58,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m47s)

when they are set there so the question


[01:39:53,230 --> 01:40:00,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m53s)

becomes what is the appropriate value


[01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h39m58s)

for those


[01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,779](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m01s)

[Music]


[01:40:07,809 --> 01:40:15,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m07s)

because we we don't want to blindly


[01:40:11,889 --> 01:40:18,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m11s)

universally apply those we only want to


[01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:18,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m15s)

apply those sometimes


[01:40:33,139 --> 01:40:36,139](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m33s)

well


[01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:54,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m47s)

I said pose we could date a trigger it


[01:40:56,010 --> 01:41:03,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m56s)

I'm wondering if double is the


[01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:06,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h40m58s)

appropriate size or if it should be a


[01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m03s)

knowable double


[01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:22,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m13s)

you know what I think we should do well


[01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:26,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m17s)

okay so we can we can actually cheat so


[01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:28,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m22s)

I hate doing this but it does work so


[01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:30,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m26s)

we'll throw it in real quick and then


[01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:38,219](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m28s)

we'll explain what's going on


[01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:41,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m30s)

so the nan and I'm gonna double-check


[01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:47,429](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m38s)

this here in just a moment but I believe


[01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:52,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m41s)

if we were to look at on the the the


[01:41:47,429 --> 01:41:54,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m47s)

width property itself so we'll go to the


[01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:59,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m52s)

framework element with property the


[01:41:54,750 --> 01:42:04,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m54s)

default value of this guy is double nan


[01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:06,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h41m59s)

so by defaulting ours to double nan it


[01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:09,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m04s)

will be the same as if the width


[01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:10,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m06s)

property was never set same with the


[01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:16,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m09s)

height


[01:42:10,050 --> 01:42:17,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m10s)

I guess I'm okay with that because


[01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:19,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m16s)

that's how the built-in width and height


[01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:23,099](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m17s)

properties work on framework element and


[01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:29,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m19s)

so these attached properties are


[01:42:23,099 --> 01:42:33,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m23s)

effectively forwarding those out there


[01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:39,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m29s)

called thumb width and some height yeah


[01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:43,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m33s)

that makes sense though I'm not sure


[01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:46,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m39s)

that that double nan trick is though it


[01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:49,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m43s)

makes sense to somebody who is very


[01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:51,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m46s)

familiar with the inner workings of WPF


[01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:56,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m49s)

I don't know if it's necessarily


[01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:59,639](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m51s)

familiar familiar or makes good sense to


[01:42:56,550 --> 01:43:05,969](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m56s)

a brand new person starting to learn


[01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:08,520](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h42m59s)

this framework so but I think for now it


[01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:10,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m05s)

is what it is I'll take it so let's see


[01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:13,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m08s)

we were on the grids' page and we were


[01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:16,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m10s)

collapsing the height of our window to


[01:43:13,409 --> 01:43:18,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m13s)

cause the scrollbar to come up and there


[01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:21,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m16s)

we get our scrollbar it has our nice


[01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:21,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m18s)

animations


[01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:30,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m23s)

yeah okay so that works if we come over


[01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:34,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m27s)

here this guy has the nice minimalist


[01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:38,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m30s)

style to show that off a little better


[01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:40,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m34s)

better better better better better and


[01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:48,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m38s)

there we can see the horizontal one


[01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:50,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m40s)

working but it is interesting to me that


[01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:54,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m48s)

these horizontal ones don't appear to


[01:43:50,610 --> 01:44:00,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m50s)

have the same lightened work as the


[01:43:54,030 --> 01:44:05,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h43m54s)

other ones that's interesting to me that


[01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:05,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m00s)

makes me wonder if we miss something in


[01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:13,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m05s)

one of these changes five eight three


[01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:20,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m10s)

did we make it change and then not


[01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:24,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m13s)

propagate it down there it is pasady


[01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:26,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m20s)

zero point five so five eight three five


[01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:30,540](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m24s)

so we brought down the visual state


[01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:34,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m26s)

manager but not the default value there


[01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:45,720](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m30s)

we go now they all look the same


[01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:49,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m34s)

okay this is why we test okay sweet I'm


[01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:52,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m45s)

happier with this I am happier with this


[01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:54,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m49s)

so let's just quickly review these


[01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:58,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m52s)

changes and then we'll get these pushed


[01:44:54,570 --> 01:45:02,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m54s)

in and I think we can just merge them so


[01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:07,950](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h44m58s)

let's see here so main window I assume


[01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:11,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m02s)

it's just bringing back in I think you


[01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:13,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m07s)

snoop go away so this guy ooh look at


[01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:15,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m11s)

this they've got a scroll bar


[01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:15,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m13s)

interesting they just a lawful


[01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:17,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m15s)

transparency


[01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:22,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m15s)

I'm sure that's what we want is default


[01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:27,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m17s)

but kind of cool so this guy here is


[01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:31,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m22s)

just no idea why it's highlighting line


[01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:33,810](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m27s)

46 must be a white space change that I


[01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:35,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m31s)

can't see but just adding in the


[01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:38,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m33s)

resource for the scrollbar to force it


[01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:38,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m35s)

into the minimalist style


[01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:45,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m40s)

a scrollbar assist we should see a whole


[01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:49,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m42s)

bunch of added attached properties we


[01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:54,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m45s)

also renamed the it to buttons


[01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:56,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m49s)

visibility from arrows visibility let's


[01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:59,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m54s)

see we kicked on the defaults we


[01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:02,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m56s)

switched back from using the new style


[01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:06,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h45m59s)

back to the original one which is I


[01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:08,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m02s)

think what we want that way everything


[01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:12,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m06s)

lives in one style and you just toggle


[01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:16,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m08s)

stuff on and off with a secondary style


[01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:20,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m12s)

to have it we added see visibility on


[01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m16s)

the scroll bar and then a whole bunch of


[01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:26,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m20s)

changes so white space there


[01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:33,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m22s)

let's review over so we can actually see


[01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:39,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m26s)

this so from their height with opacity


[01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:39,560](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m33s)

some radius great


[01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:49,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m40s)

those guys get deprecated wonderful


[01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:54,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m44s)

group state so the opacity change visual


[01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:55,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m49s)

state manager auto auto grid row just


[01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:58,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m54s)

making a quick mental note of all of


[01:46:55,890 --> 01:47:01,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m55s)

these so we can compare them with what's


[01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:03,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h46m58s)

down here so default state which was the


[01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:07,170](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m01s)

last bug on the horizontal scrollbar


[01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:10,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m03s)

visual states brought down so five point


[01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:13,230](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m07s)

eight point three it may be worth


[01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:15,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m10s)

extracting these values out into a


[01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:23,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m13s)

shared resource so that they can be used


[01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:24,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m15s)

in both places yeah the problem with


[01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:26,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m23s)

extracting them into a shared resources


[01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m24s)

then theoretically somebody else could


[01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:34,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m26s)

reference them and I don't really want


[01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:37,050](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m28s)

to expose those but again yeah so let's


[01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:39,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m34s)

see with Auto on these to allow to


[01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:44,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m37s)

collapse on the scroll bar visibility


[01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:46,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m39s)

column setter and then the height of


[01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:49,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m44s)

this guy again if anybody has


[01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m46s)

suggestions on the scrollbar assist


[01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:53,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m49s)

properties


[01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:54,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m50s)

some height versus thumb width again the


[01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:57,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m53s)

problem I really don't like about them


[01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m54s)

is it's not I don't think it's


[01:47:57,130 --> 01:48:00,640](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m57s)

completely obvious that if I set thumb


[01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h47m58s)

height it's only going to apply to a


[01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m00s)

horizontal scrollbar


[01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:07,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m01s)

I think implicitly it makes sense but I


[01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:09,220](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m04s)

don't necessarily want to trust that


[01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:10,660](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m07s)

that tracks for everybody and then a


[01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:12,610](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m09s)

bunch of deletions at our middle of


[01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:20,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m10s)

styled the bottom oh we should clean


[01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:27,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m12s)

this guy up we should clean him up yep


[01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:31,090](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m20s)

so let's just go in general I I avoid


[01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:32,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m27s)

just commenting out code because we have


[01:48:31,090 --> 01:48:34,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m31s)

source control that's what it's for is


[01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:38,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m32s)

to keep track of a history of stuff so


[01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:41,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m34s)

unless there's a reason to leave it in


[01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:44,710](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m38s)

I generally advocate clearing it out


[01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:49,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m41s)

keeping the code base clean so that


[01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:57,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m44s)

should be their stage file now hopefully


[01:48:49,000 --> 01:49:05,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m49s)

you just show a bunch of deletes okay so


[01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:14,700](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h48m57s)

we'll put a commit up scrollbar style so


[01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:23,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m05s)

let's see moved to only having a single


[01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:24,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m14s)

style and toggling values with attached


[01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:35,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m23s)

properties


[01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:35,940](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m24s)

let's see added attached properties for


[01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:49,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m39s)

corner radius height width anything else


[01:49:55,620 --> 01:50:04,260](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m55s)

minimal


[01:49:58,310 --> 01:50:08,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h49m58s)

minimal style to match other styles in


[01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:16,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m04s)

the library okay


[01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:18,989](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m08s)

commit and one of the perks of having


[01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:22,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m16s)

right access on the library is I can


[01:50:18,989 --> 01:50:25,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m18s)

push my changes to pull requests unless


[01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:28,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m22s)

unless he's unkicked the box to deny me


[01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:30,469](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m25s)

that permission but by default it is on


[01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:35,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m28s)

so huzzah


[01:50:30,469 --> 01:50:43,350](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m30s)

so now this guy is there and we should


[01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:47,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m35s)

see CI builds kick off in just a moment


[01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:50,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m43s)

so we will I intentionally PO if you see


[01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:53,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m47s)

me mark myself as a reviewer really all


[01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:55,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m50s)

that is is a reminder to myself that I


[01:50:53,790 --> 01:51:00,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m53s)

want to make sure that I get something


[01:50:55,650 --> 01:51:03,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h50m55s)

reviewed before it gets merged in so


[01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:07,620](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m00s)

don't take that as a negative by any


[01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:09,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m03s)

means it really just means that at the


[01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:11,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m07s)

time I saw your pull request I didn't


[01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:15,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m09s)

have time to review it and I left myself


[01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:19,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m11s)

a little to-do reminder okay so as soon


[01:51:15,239 --> 01:51:21,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m15s)

as this guy progress checks pass which


[01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:23,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m19s)

shouldn't take but more than a moment we


[01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:26,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m21s)

don't have a lot of unit tests in the


[01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:29,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m23s)

library largely because this is a themed


[01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:33,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m26s)

library and so there's not a like we


[01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:36,330](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m29s)

can't necessarily really unit test a


[01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:39,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m33s)

theme library very easily so a lot of it


[01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:42,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m36s)

is kind of done visually and on the fly


[01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:43,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m39s)

and the demo app so again I do


[01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:46,020](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m42s)

appreciate if people are actually


[01:51:43,290 --> 01:51:47,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m43s)

willing to go and and test out those


[01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:49,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m46s)

preview builds and see how things work


[01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:52,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m47s)

even just downloading the demo app and


[01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:54,420](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m49s)

playing with the newer features that


[01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:58,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m52s)

come in to make sure that they that it's


[01:51:54,420 --> 01:52:01,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m54s)

not breaking anything is amazing because


[01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:03,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h51m58s)

I we have gotten bug reports of people


[01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:06,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m01s)

testing those CI builds ahead of time


[01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:09,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m03s)

and it's it's always appreciative to to


[01:52:06,929 --> 01:52:09,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m06s)

get those in


[01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:15,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m10s)

come on pipeline you can do it you can


[01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m13s)

do it


[01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:24,219](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m16s)

see view more details go go gadget


[01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:38,949](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m20s)

that's what I want to see I see what


[01:52:24,219 --> 01:52:46,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m24s)

you're doing yeah it compiles that runs


[01:52:38,949 --> 01:52:54,429](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m38s)

with a slew of unit tests and then it'll


[01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:57,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m46s)

technically do some some demoing and


[01:52:54,429 --> 01:52:59,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m54s)

some pushing of stuff don't necessarily


[01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:03,460](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m57s)

worry about these so right now we're


[01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:06,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h52m59s)

running to CI pipelines we're using


[01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:09,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m03s)

Azure DevOps and app they're sort of in


[01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:11,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m06s)

parallel there's some stuff I want to do


[01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:14,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m09s)

on the the DevOps pipelines


[01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:16,000](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m11s)

and once I'm satisfied that they're


[01:53:14,410 --> 01:53:18,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m14s)

working appropriately then we'll go


[01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m16s)

ahead and turn off out there because


[01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:24,600](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m18s)

DevOps just gives you a lot more power


[01:53:21,790 --> 01:53:26,830](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m21s)

and control over every little detail


[01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m24s)

don't take this as a negative on out


[01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:30,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m26s)

there I think it is by far if you're


[01:53:28,390 --> 01:53:33,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m28s)

doing an open source project it is the


[01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:35,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m30s)

easiest CI system I've used to get up


[01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:37,060](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m33s)

and running it's a lot of point click


[01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:40,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m35s)

and away you go and everything just


[01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:42,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m37s)

works there's a little bit more


[01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:45,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m40s)

munching of stuff that you have to do


[01:53:42,910 --> 01:53:49,420](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m42s)

you can just compare the difference in


[01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:51,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m45s)

the yamo files for both the azure devops


[01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:59,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m49s)

pipeline and the app fair at the root of


[01:53:51,250 --> 01:54:03,820](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m51s)

our repo success success success success


[01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:05,679](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h53m59s)

and perfect so we will see make sure


[01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:12,280](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m03s)

this is in the to 600 release which it


[01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:16,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m05s)

is great squashing merge yeah great


[01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:17,949](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m12s)

perfect so that'll kick that off and the


[01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:21,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m16s)

merge into master is what will


[01:54:17,949 --> 01:54:22,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m17s)

ultimately kick off a CI build out in


[01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:26,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m21s)

you get


[01:54:22,769 --> 01:54:29,510](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m22s)

so that'll go out shortly and let's see


[01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:32,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m26s)

so this guy should be marked as fixes or


[01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:35,789](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m29s)

should be marked as fixed and then this


[01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:37,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m32s)

PR I think we just need to add a comment


[01:54:35,789 --> 01:54:42,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m35s)

too so let's just make sure everything


[01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:44,789](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m37s)

goes the way it's supposed to here so


[01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:55,909](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m42s)

this guy is marked as fixed he's in 2/6


[01:54:44,789 --> 01:54:55,909](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h54m44s)

oh great and then I think yeah


[01:55:00,249 --> 01:55:02,949](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m00s)

actually I think we want to leave a


[01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:04,599](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m01s)

comment on that other one because that


[01:55:02,949 --> 01:55:16,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m02s)

was there was quite a bit of discussion


[01:55:04,599 --> 01:55:16,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m04s)

on here work


[01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:38,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m26s)

styles and and done see the work on PR


[01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:44,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m35s)

and I don't I've already forgotten my


[01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:44,180](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m38s)

number twelve seventy yeah that one


[01:55:54,290 --> 01:56:00,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m54s)

okay so we will close and comment on


[01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:02,160](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h55m57s)

this one she gets us a little closer to


[01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:06,930](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m00s)

getting this to 6o release out the door


[01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:10,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m02s)

a little bit closer slow and steady slow


[01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:12,690](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m06s)

unsteady so if anybody is interested


[01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:20,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m10s)

issue six four six has all of this


[01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:25,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m12s)

scrollbar stuff in it so for all the


[01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:25,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m20s)

discussion 70


[01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:54,980](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m46s)

and my spelling is not great but we will


[01:56:51,110 --> 01:56:57,470](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m51s)

throw that on there and that way people


[01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:59,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m54s)

are clear because again I do very much


[01:56:57,470 --> 01:57:05,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m57s)

value everyone's feedback on this stuff


[01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:09,140](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h56m59s)

so this is all about kind of having this


[01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:13,130](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m05s)

be what's useful for people so let's


[01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:17,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m09s)

take a quick look I know eighty one


[01:57:13,130 --> 01:57:21,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m13s)

person and so this icon pack I threw in


[01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:24,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m17s)

this just needs to be done there so the


[01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:28,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m21s)

icon pack inside of this library just


[01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:33,890](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m24s)

pulls the material design icons but it's


[01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:37,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m28s)

done via the there's a separate project


[01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:39,680](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m33s)

let me just pull it open here real quick


[01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:45,580](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m37s)

huh


[01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:49,100](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m39s)

so if we jump in here this MD res


[01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:53,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m45s)

project in here is actually what has all


[01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:55,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m49s)

of the code I think there was yeah this


[01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:57,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m53s)

resource generation is the solution file


[01:57:55,250 --> 01:58:00,290](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m55s)

for it so it'll go through and generate


[01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:01,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h57m57s)

like the default color pallet resource


[01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:04,790](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m00s)

dictionaries it'll go through and


[01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:07,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m01s)

generate the material design icons it's


[01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:08,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m04s)

basically just a simple CLI app that can


[01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:13,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m07s)

do a bunch of this auto generation


[01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:17,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m08s)

something I would love to get in is a


[01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:21,380](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m13s)

nightly build out on Azure DevOps that


[01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:23,390](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m17s)

can go through and pull in the material


[01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:27,080](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m21s)

design icons and if there's a change


[01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:28,910](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m23s)

just commit it that way master doesn't


[01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,800](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m27s)

lag behind every time there's a change


[01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:34,550](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m28s)

here I try to keep track of when they


[01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:37,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m30s)

release updates but quite frankly I get


[01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:41,210](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m34s)

busy or I miss them and it doesn't


[01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:44,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m37s)

always get updated so I do try before we


[01:58:41,210 --> 01:58:47,120](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m41s)

do a release like to 602 make sure that


[01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:48,770](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m44s)

I go and run that just to pick up all


[01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:50,780](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m47s)

the latest stuff but it doesn't


[01:58:48,770 --> 01:58:53,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m48s)

necessarily mean that it's always in


[01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:55,730](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m50s)

there so this memory leak is probably


[01:58:53,630 --> 01:58:58,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m53s)

the next thing I want to work on as


[01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:58,469](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m55s)

these types of bugs I usually try to pry


[01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:00,960](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m58s)

or


[01:58:58,469 --> 01:59:02,760](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h58m58s)

I should say bugs in general unless


[01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:07,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m00s)

they're very low priority I try to


[01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:11,630](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m02s)

prioritize above features and we've got


[01:59:07,070 --> 01:59:16,590](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m07s)

several bits of stuff that people have


[01:59:11,630 --> 01:59:18,539](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m11s)

brought in and fixed so and this one


[01:59:16,590 --> 01:59:24,659](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m16s)

here is just a wiki change so that one


[01:59:18,539 --> 01:59:26,909](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m18s)

might get knocked out quickly this this


[01:59:24,659 --> 01:59:33,929](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m24s)

is a pretty simple bug if anybody wanted


[01:59:26,909 --> 01:59:36,599](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m26s)

to pick it up but it's also one that the


[01:59:33,929 --> 01:59:44,849](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m33s)

necessity of it is a little less with


[01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:46,889](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m36s)

the the new theming stuff yeah III may


[01:59:44,849 --> 01:59:48,570](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m44s)

and I I realize I'm the one who opened


[01:59:46,889 --> 01:59:52,949](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m46s)

it but I may end up just punting it as


[01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:55,190](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m48s)

well so that I think is the state of


[01:59:52,949 --> 01:59:59,150](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m52s)

where the rest of this to 6o stuff goes


[01:59:55,190 --> 02:00:02,519](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m55s)

this specified colors for themes I think


[01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:06,530](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=01h59m59s)

why did I leave this open I thought I


[02:00:02,519 --> 02:00:09,179](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m02s)

thought it should been resolved oh


[02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:15,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m06s)

because this was bright this was


[02:00:09,179 --> 02:00:21,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m09s)

separating the colors from the brushes


[02:00:15,409 --> 02:00:21,920](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m15s)

I'm not entirely clear the value of this


[02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:34,870](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m26s)

I see what it's doing and I just don't


[02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:37,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m29s)

recall I need to take a look at this and


[02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:46,200](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m34s)

fee that's why I left it open because I


[02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:48,490](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m37s)

I don't I don't know if that's due to


[02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:53,410](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m46s)

existing brushes with material design


[02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:54,750](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m48s)

colors not to use existing brushes ah so


[02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:57,370](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m53s)

that was the deal


[02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:59,440](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m54s)

needing to create your own brushes to


[02:00:57,370 --> 02:01:09,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m57s)

override theirs and reuse the same


[02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:10,840](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h00m59s)

colors got it okay I will I will go


[02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:12,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m09s)

through and check this because just


[02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:16,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m10s)

exposing them in the the resource


[02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:21,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m12s)

dictionary is fine and M will work right


[02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:23,740](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m16s)

up until you do a a theme change from


[02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:30,040](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m21s)

light to dark oh that's something we


[02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:34,300](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m23s)

didn't actually test that's let's do


[02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:36,480](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m30s)

that real quick because we should really


[02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:45,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m34s)

verify that our scroll bar stuff works


[02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:45,990](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m36s)

and dark theme as well hey look at that


[02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:56,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m51s)

nice again that was the that was the


[02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:59,340](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m53s)

beauty of using the material design body


[02:01:56,769 --> 02:02:02,619](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m56s)

brush is I knew that it would then


[02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:03,909](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h01m59s)

translate well into two matching


[02:02:02,619 --> 02:02:06,070](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m02s)

whatever the foreground color was


[02:02:03,909 --> 02:02:08,769](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m03s)

there's a couple places where we do that


[02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:11,739](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m06s)

it's it's kind of a blessing and a curse


[02:02:08,769 --> 02:02:13,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m08s)

to do it that way it's the easiest


[02:02:11,739 --> 02:02:16,239](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m11s)

option to make sure that things look


[02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:19,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m13s)

good across the themes but it can also


[02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:22,360](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m16s)

bite you if somebody wants to go and and


[02:02:19,409 --> 02:02:23,469](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m19s)

override it in this case I don't think


[02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:25,030](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m22s)

it's that big of a deal


[02:02:23,469 --> 02:02:26,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m23s)

because we could do that same color


[02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:29,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m25s)

implicit resource at the scroll bar


[02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:32,409](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m26s)

level and hijack it and it's the only


[02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:38,010](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m29s)

thing inside of the scroll bar so it


[02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:41,349](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m32s)

shouldn't have any adverse effects sweet


[02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:45,369](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m38s)

okay well I think with that I'm probably


[02:02:41,349 --> 02:02:48,039](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m41s)

going to sign off for the night thank


[02:02:45,369 --> 02:02:49,719](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m45s)

you for coming and hanging out for a


[02:02:48,039 --> 02:02:52,329](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m48s)

little bit and doing some code hopefully


[02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:54,880](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m49s)

this has been helpful for people I do


[02:02:52,329 --> 02:02:56,860](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m52s)

appreciate when I hear people say that


[02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,389](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m54s)

they either watch the videos or


[02:02:56,860 --> 02:03:00,400](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m56s)

subscribe just so that I know that this


[02:02:58,389 --> 02:03:02,320](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h02m58s)

is actually useful for people and I'm


[02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:06,900](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m00s)

not just wasting my time and and


[02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:11,110](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m02s)

prattling on and on and on by myself so


[02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:12,250](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m06s)

I will sign off I will get this uploaded


[02:03:11,110 --> 02:03:14,500](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m11s)

to YouTube


[02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:18,670](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m12s)

probably in the next 24 hours I try to


[02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:20,650](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m14s)

not let them linger too long so hope you


[02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:22,179](https://youtu.be/oF8mthTplGA?t=02h03m18s)
