[00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m13s)

okay sorry about that yeah sorry about


[00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m16s)

that tied my mic was off so I'm gonna go


[00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m19s)

back and start over and then I'm going


[00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m21s)

to edit this stream so that I don't look


[00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m23s)

like a complete fool so what I was going


[00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:31,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m27s)

through is tonight I'm gonna try to bust


[00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m29s)

through as much of the to 600 release as


[00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m31s)

we can and see how far we can actually


[00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m34s)

get I optimistically there's not that


[00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,059](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m37s)

much here so I think we can probably get


[00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m39s)

through most of these items so if people


[00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m43s)

have questions or there's example isn't


[00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m44s)

what not you want to see I have no


[00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m46s)

problem deviating otherwise my go-to


[00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m49s)

setting is I'm just gonna keep working


[00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m51s)

through this and see how much of this we


[00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,399](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m53s)

can get knocked out I think I'm actually


[00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:03,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m56s)

going to ignore the bug for now and


[00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m00s)

start at the bottom and work up because


[00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m03s)

the easier ones are at the bottom and I


[00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m06s)

was going to boost my confidence before


[00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m08s)

getting too carried away so this first


[00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:19,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m11s)

one down here we'll get this guy fired


[00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:22,259](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m13s)

up so pull requests to 8 3 so I've left


[00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,149](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m19s)

this one open for quite a while for


[00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,679](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m22s)

those people who are interested the the


[00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:33,039](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m25s)

basic premise of this one is I'm Sergey


[00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:34,209](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m29s)

and I will not try the last name because


[00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m33s)

I'll try to avoid making a fool of


[00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:40,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m34s)

myself was needing the actual brush


[00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,569](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m37s)

colors specified as resources for the


[00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m40s)

purposes of actually being able to build


[00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:48,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m43s)

out alternate themes so if you were


[00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m45s)

going to say wreath theme


[00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:55,149](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m48s)

some other control library like I think


[00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m50s)

he was using the exceed controls it's


[00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m55s)

very hard to Rieti meeee if all you have


[00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m57s)

is the brushes defined in the resources


[00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m01s)

and not the actual colors themselves so


[00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:08,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m03s)

if you need to say redefine a brush with


[00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m06s)

a color you can still do it but you have


[00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m08s)

to go through some extra steps and it


[00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m10s)

would be easier if this was defined in


[00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,739](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m11s)

here now thankfully I so I don't think


[00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m15s)

we're gonna take this pull request as is


[00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m16s)

because this is working on the old


[00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m18s)

theming library stuff and I am very much


[00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m22s)

looking towards the new theming library


[00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m24s)

code so but I left this in here


[00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m27s)

as a note to myself to not forget that


[00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m29s)

we wanted to include this feature as


[00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m31s)

part of the new theming code that's


[00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:41,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m34s)

actually going out with too sick so so


[00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m37s)

backing up so the the the guts of the


[00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m41s)

new theming code for anybody who hasn't


[00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m44s)

played with it really kind of boils down


[00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m46s)

to this set theme call on resource


[00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m50s)

dictionary extensions it acts on a


[00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m53s)

resource dictionary and takes in one of


[00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m54s)

these I themed objects so let's look at


[00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m57s)

these real quick so the eye themed


[00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m59s)

objects are really just a lists of


[00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m01s)

colors that's all they are


[00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m04s)

ideally this solves a lot of the


[00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m06s)

problems that we fought with in the past


[00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m08s)

where people want to declare their own


[00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m09s)

custom color themes and it's really


[00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m11s)

difficult to go through and get and


[00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m15s)

specify your own themes especially if


[00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m18s)

you want to toggle between the built-in


[00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m19s)

themes your own custom theme and that so


[00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m22s)

now we're ski scenario you can just


[00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m25s)

implement an a theme but there's


[00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m27s)

actually some clever tricks to hopefully


[00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m31s)

cover all of the common cases so real


[00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m33s)

quick let's just take a look at this so


[00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:44,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m36s)

in the demo app in the App damo there


[00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m41s)

are we I tried to leave in comments


[00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m44s)

showing off the different ways of doing


[00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m46s)

the theming so one is you can go and do


[00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m49s)

the same way that we've done in the last


[00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m51s)

I forget probably since the beginning


[00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m53s)

number of versions at least in all the


[00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,459](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m56s)

2x versions you can just declare the


[00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m58s)

resource dictionaries where you declare


[00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m00s)

light or dark theme you declare a


[00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m03s)

primary color and then you declare an


[00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m04s)

accent color and that defines all your


[00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m06s)

color brushes great fine this works


[00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m09s)

great but if you're like me you can


[00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m12s)

never remember exactly what these are


[00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,709](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m14s)

and so you end up going back and copying


[00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m16s)

and pasting from another app or the demo


[00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m17s)

app just to try to remember these things


[00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m20s)

and toggle out just these colors which


[00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m23s)

has always been a little obnoxious to me


[00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m25s)

so in the to 601 there is now new markup


[00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m29s)

extensions that just return new resource


[00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m32s)

dictionaries so for example rather than


[00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m36s)

doing this bit of work here where you


[00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m38s)

declare light deep purple and lime as


[00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m39s)

your accent color


[00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:48,129](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m41s)

you can do something like this where you


[00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m45s)

declare the base theme either light or


[00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:55,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m48s)

dark and because these are enums you get


[00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m52s)

nice intellisense inherit is not


[00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m55s)

currently implemented so if you specify


[00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m57s)

inherit at the root level it won't do


[00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m59s)

anything


[00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m01s)

you'll get neither the light nor the


[00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m03s)

dark theme brushes which isn't quite


[00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m04s)

right at some point I want to go through


[00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m07s)

and have this when the users on a


[00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:15,789](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m09s)

Windows 8 or 10 machine actually pull


[00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m12s)

the system to find state whether it's


[00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:20,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m15s)

light or dark theme but that is not


[00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m18s)

implemented yet at the root level so for


[00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m20s)

now pick light or dark but then you've


[00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m22s)

also got enums for your primary and


[00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m23s)

accent color


[00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m24s)

so rather than these three lines which


[00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m26s)

are somewhat difficult to remember the


[00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m27s)

URIs for you can just specify a couple


[00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m30s)

enums and you're done right and then for


[00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m33s)

those people who want more control than


[00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m35s)

just the built in theme colors you've


[00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m38s)

also got the custom color theme which


[00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m42s)

the base theme is still the same light


[00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m44s)

or dark but then you can specify any


[00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:54,009](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m46s)

sort of RGB color that you want so you


[00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:55,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m51s)

know if you want to just go through and


[00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:58,930](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m54s)

specify something like that to get lime


[00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m55s)

or whatever other color you want great


[00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m58s)

you can then build these out and then


[00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,029](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m02s)

based upon whatever color you pick here


[00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,759](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m04s)

it kind of picks arbitrary light and


[00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:13,719](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m07s)

dark hues so this is effectively the mid


[00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m09s)

hue for the color and it'll do some


[00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m13s)

color magic for on the HSV color space


[00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m16s)

and convert to light and dark versions


[00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,909](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m18s)

of it so those are the new color themes


[00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m22s)

but ultimately if we walk through how


[00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:30,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m24s)

all of these things work what they end


[00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m28s)

up doing is really just calling set


[00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,449](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m30s)

theme on a resource dictionary which is


[00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m32s)

all these markup extensions do is they


[00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m34s)

they build up one of these theme objects


[00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m36s)

call this set theme method and it walks


[00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,449](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m39s)

through this set solid color brush and


[00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:46,779](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m41s)

make sure that all of our brushes are


[00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:49,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m43s)

defined it is worth noting there are


[00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:51,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m46s)

technically this secondary accent brush


[00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m49s)

and secondary accent foreground brush


[00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m51s)

these should be considered


[00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m54s)

deprecated and obsolete so if you're


[00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m56s)

using these directly in your code


[00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m58s)

please migrate away the appropriate


[00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m00s)

changes is going to be the secondary


[00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,629](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m02s)

brushes so specifically secondary hue


[00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m06s)

mid brush and foreground brush are the


[00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m08s)

direct replacements but now we also have


[00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m11s)

light and dark hues for your accent


[00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m14s)

color as well so the library right now


[00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,229](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m16s)

is only using the mid stuff but these


[00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m19s)

other light and dark versions are


[00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:27,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m21s)

available okay so all of that said what


[00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,539](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m25s)

this issue was actually looking for is


[00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,909](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m27s)

to take these colors that are being


[00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:35,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m29s)

passed in and actually stored them as


[00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:39,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m31s)

resources as well so I'm going to jump


[00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:47,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m35s)

over here and like a good programmer


[00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:52,789](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m39s)

create a branch let's see and because I


[00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:56,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m47s)

can't remember my fix 683 great so we


[00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m52s)

will create a branch that way we can


[00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m56s)

pull request it back in when we're done


[00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:04,729](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m57s)

and away we go and I think this is going


[00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,259](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m59s)

to be a very simple simple bit of code


[00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,930](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m04s)

to write because in here we're already


[00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m06s)

passing in the color value as well as


[00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m08s)

the name so I think that the the


[00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m11s)

simplest thing to do is down here before


[00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:23,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m14s)

we get too far carried away is just as


[00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:26,779](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m17s)

simple as source dictionary and spelling


[00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:33,829](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m23s)

counts you must spell at least


[00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:35,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m26s)

consistently in our industry I think


[00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:37,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m33s)

it's going to be as simple as that


[00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,029](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m35s)

one-liner which is much simpler than


[00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:45,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m37s)

what it was in the old API so again I'm


[00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:48,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m41s)

less interested in taking the the the


[00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m45s)

pull request as is but I do want to make


[00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,709](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m48s)

sure we get that same equivalent feature


[00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,209](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m49s)

so if other people want to go through


[00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:58,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m51s)

and theme this stuff out they can and I


[00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m56s)

believe that just works it is important


[00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m58s)

to note that if you are using the old


[00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m01s)

style of setting your resource


[00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m03s)

dictionaries like this you are not going


[00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m05s)

to pick up this feature and I'm


[00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,889](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m07s)

not real concerned with that I suspect


[00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,439](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m10s)

most people will migrate off if this is


[00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m12s)

the feature that they're looking for so


[00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:19,759](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m15s)

again


[00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,319](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m16s)

I'm gonna call this good enough Sergei


[00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,579](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m19s)

if you happen to be watching this at


[00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m21s)

some point and this doesn't meet your


[00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m22s)

needs please shoot me a message and


[00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m23s)

reopen and I would love to discuss


[00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:34,189](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m26s)

further but I'm hoping that being able


[00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:36,709](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m28s)

to do this should solve it so that is


[00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:44,529](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m34s)

not where we are going there we go


[00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:51,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m36s)

so let's see add color resources in


[00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:52,879](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m44s)

addition to brushes I promise I can


[00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m51s)

spell I'm just not good at it when


[00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,889](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m52s)

people are watching I believe there's an


[00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,839](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m55s)

old adage that says you're typing skill


[00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m57s)

goes down based upon the number of


[00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m59s)

people watching you type and if you're


[00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,649](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m01s)

posting on the internet that goes down a


[00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:10,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m03s)

lot or maybe in my case not too much if


[00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:17,689](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m06s)

people don't enjoy watching me okay


[00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:23,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m10s)

so simple change commit and we will push


[00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:25,309](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m17s)

this guy up and then sure then we will


[00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:33,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m23s)

just pull request that in and get that


[00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:37,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m25s)

done so pull requests and we'll make


[00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:43,149](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m33s)

sure the CI stuff passes which I don't


[00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:45,759](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m37s)

believe there's anything so hang on


[00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:51,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m43s)

where'd it go


[00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:55,069](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m45s)

claimed it was pushed fix origin six six


[00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:57,939](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m51s)

eight three there is my button github


[00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:57,939](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m55s)

was just a little slow


[00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:05,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m58s)

let's see we will put this in the to 600


[00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:07,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m01s)

milestone create pull request and then


[00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:13,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m05s)

we are just going to mark the other one


[00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:36,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m07s)

is superseded and close it let's see


[00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:40,149](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m13s)

here so here and seated by comment and


[00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m36s)

one more down and then as soon as this


[00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m40s)

guy goes green which shouldn't take it


[00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m42s)

but a moment we'll merge it in and that


[00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m45s)

will be one less thing done okay back to


[00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m48s)

my milestone list and let's just keep


[00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m49s)

going on our way up


[00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m50s)

so this added stack bar message ignored


[00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m54s)

duplicate this is something I've bumped


[00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m56s)

into before on my own project so I was


[00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m00s)

glad somebody was willing to pick this


[00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m01s)

up so here's the issue for it and


[00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m03s)

there's already a corresponding pull


[00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:10,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m04s)

request for it


[00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:13,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m06s)

so in short on the snack bar you're able


[00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:17,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m10s)

to in cue messages but being able to


[00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m13s)

ignore duplicates had to be done on a


[00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m17s)

per message basis which always felt a


[00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:26,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m19s)

little awkward at times which was I was


[00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m23s)

clearly not alone in that because


[00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m26s)

ultimately especially if you're using


[00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m27s)

the message queue you want to go through


[00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m29s)

and actually turn it off at the queue


[00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m31s)

level and just sort of have I won't say


[00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m35s)

a global setting but one that applies to


[00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:44,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m37s)

every message that goes through that


[00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:47,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m39s)

queue so I had put a few docs on here


[00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,029](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m44s)

and it was pretty simple new boolean


[00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m47s)

property and then check it on the pump


[00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:56,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m49s)

async so we are going to check the pull


[00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m52s)

request for this and I believe it is as


[00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:04,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m56s)

simple as that


[00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:07,079](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m57s)

so this is the pull request for it and


[00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,699](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m04s)

let's come down here and we'll just


[00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m07s)

check this one and I think it should be


[00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:18,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m09s)

as simple as


[00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:21,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m11s)

so check box for the demo app and then


[00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m18s)

there is a property on the message queue


[00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m21s)

it is important to note that the


[00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:34,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m23s)

snackbar message queue I'll pull that up


[00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:35,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m25s)

real quick is not a it's not a it can't


[00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m34s)

have a dependency property on it because


[00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m35s)

it doesn't derive from dependency object


[00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m37s)

so that's why this property isn't


[00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m40s)

necessarily bindable so if people are


[00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m43s)

wanting to bind to this there's going to


[00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m44s)

be a little bit more work that needs to


[00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m46s)

go in but given that this is a new


[00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:55,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m48s)

feature and not necessarily just a


[00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m50s)

straight-up object I'm not sure that


[00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m55s)

that's a big deal that might be a nice


[00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m57s)

enhancement in the future if somebody


[00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m58s)

wants to go through and look at actually


[00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m00s)

making these properties bindable but it


[00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m03s)

does add a bit of overhead and


[00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m04s)

complexity to make this into a bindable


[00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:20,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m06s)

object so but ultimately if ignored


[00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:25,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m09s)

duplicate is on let's see here let's


[00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:32,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m20s)

check this out because I want to this


[00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:35,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m25s)

guy is what is around this so if ignored


[00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:47,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m32s)

duplicate but is this actually doing and


[00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:49,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m35s)

ignore all oh I think this if no because


[00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m47s)

this duplicates the same message you can


[00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:55,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m49s)

or duplicate so this is correct okay


[00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m51s)

cool so


[00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:13,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m59s)

easy merge for newer stuff I would


[00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m10s)

probably also ask for a unit test on


[00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m13s)

that but given that this was submitted


[00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m15s)

long before we had a unit test project


[00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m17s)

on here I am I don't retro actively add


[00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m20s)

requirements so this meets all the


[00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m22s)

requirements that were put on there in


[00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:30,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m23s)

the initial bit so good enough for me


[00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:35,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m26s)

so we will Oh before we do that I want


[00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:39,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m30s)

to sneak this guy into what we will do


[00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:44,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m35s)

that delete our branch from squash and


[00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:49,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m39s)

merge and all the things go through


[00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m44s)

perfect I was thinking there was a lot


[00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:56,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m49s)

of easy items easy to boost my


[00:15:51,590 --> 00:16:04,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m51s)

confidence quick okay I've lost my place


[00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:08,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m56s)

let's go back milestones and to 6-0 and


[00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m04s)

this guy should have gotten resolved


[00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m08s)

when the pull request went but clearly


[00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m10s)

it didn't so we can just close it


[00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:22,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m15s)

because it should be yeah it's linked


[00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m18s)

right there typically if you put as one


[00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m22s)

of the lines in your description fixes


[00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m24s)

pound and then the issue number it'll


[00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:32,930](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m25s)

auto close these which makes it mildly


[00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:35,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m27s)

nicer for me but not a big deal okay


[00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m32s)

color picker add hue sliding so let's


[00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m35s)

see which one this is where we start


[00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:43,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m37s)

getting into the more interesting ones


[00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:46,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m38s)

so this is going to be a change to the


[00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m43s)

new color picker control so two six zero


[00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m46s)

we added a color picker control to


[00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m49s)

support all of the new theming stuff so


[00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m51s)

because there is actually the ability to


[00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m55s)

pick arbitrary colors we wanted an a


[00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m58s)

reasonable color picker built-in ideally


[00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m01s)

something that was kind of similar ish


[00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m03s)

to the way the material design picker


[00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:12,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m06s)

works so we got something close to that


[00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:17,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m09s)

update icon pack is just a script


[00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:19,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m12s)

so little less concerned but you know


[00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,709](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m17s)

what let's go through and do let's do


[00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,419](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m19s)

this one first because this is this will


[00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m21s)

be this will be another quick and easy


[00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:31,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m23s)

win and then anybody using the preview


[00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:34,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m26s)

packages can pick it up so right now the


[00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m31s)

the icons built in the library are built


[00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m34s)

with a script and that script has to be


[00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:44,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m37s)

manually run which is a little obnoxious


[00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m40s)

I do have plans to add it in so right


[00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m44s)

now we're kind of in a transition period


[00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m46s)

between a purveyor and Azure DevOps so


[00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m50s)

I've got both Azure DevOps running as


[00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,659](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m52s)

well as app they're running


[00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:58,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m54s)

simultaneously so when you do a pull


[00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:01,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m56s)

request the verification you see is


[00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m58s)

coming from Azure DevOps but when it


[00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m01s)

actually does the new get package build


[00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,059](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m02s)

and release that's coming out of app


[00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m04s)

there so I've got the the azure DevOps


[00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:12,289](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m08s)

building it it's a matter of get once


[00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m10s)

I'm confident that it's working the


[00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:17,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m12s)

exact same as what app fare is doing I'm


[00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m14s)

gonna switch over the new get publish


[00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m17s)

out of out there and then we can let out


[00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m18s)

there just kind of sit there for a


[00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,909](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m20s)

little bit not being used and then


[00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m22s)

eventually it can go away and we can use


[00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:31,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m24s)

DevOps for all of it the other advantage


[00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:35,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m27s)

of DevOps is I'm wanting to put in an


[00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:38,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m31s)

automatic script so that it runs say


[00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m35s)

nightly or weekly and just goes and


[00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,929](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m38s)

pings out looking to see if there's


[00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m39s)

updates to the material design icons and


[00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:46,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m41s)

then runs through and queues up a pull


[00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m44s)

request that way when there's changes


[00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m46s)

we'll get an automatic pull request that


[00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m48s)

comes in and that can be reviewed and


[00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:57,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m51s)

merged and actually get that going so


[00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:59,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m53s)

I'm hoping that will be a simple thing


[00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,309](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m57s)

to do again not a hundred percent


[00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m59s)

confident if somebody wants to take a


[00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:07,039](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m01s)

stab at doing a simple PowerShell script


[00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m04s)

for that that's probably the way I was


[00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,669](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m07s)

looking at doing it there's a few other


[00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m09s)

things that I'm looking to get scripted


[00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m10s)

as part of the DevOps pipeline but that


[00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m13s)

should be simple so for anyone


[00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m16s)

interested in actually like if you want


[00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m19s)

to see where the resource generation


[00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m20s)

happens there's an extra solution file


[00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m22s)

right at the root of the repo some


[00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m25s)

material design


[00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m25s)

we'll get resource generation solution


[00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m27s)

and then this guy fires up and I always


[00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m31s)

have to open program CS because I can


[00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m33s)

never remember exactly how this guy


[00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:44,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m35s)

works it sounds like my dog is excited


[00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:49,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m39s)

about something let's see so I need to


[00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:53,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m44s)

pass in what to my main method so if we


[00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:57,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m49s)

pass in args generate zamel generate


[00:19:53,660 --> 00:20:04,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m53s)

JSON all swatches because we also


[00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:06,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m57s)

generate the color themes come on come


[00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m04s)

on Visual Studio you can do it I promise


[00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m06s)

it's not that hard to open a solution


[00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m08s)

I'm sure it's actually probably the


[00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:18,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m10s)

resharper going and trying to grep the


[00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:21,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m13s)

entire solution so if we pass in a


[00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:25,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m18s)

argument of icons it'll do the icon


[00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:27,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m21s)

thing and run great so I think I might


[00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m25s)

even have this already set because I


[00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m27s)

think doing icons was the last thing I


[00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m29s)

did anyway


[00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m29s)

but for command-line apps if people


[00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m32s)

haven't done this before you can either


[00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m34s)

go and just manually invoke them on the


[00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m36s)

command line but on your debug it


[00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:44,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m38s)

doesn't look like I have it you can


[00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m40s)

actually just specify command line


[00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m44s)

arguments to get past when you launch


[00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m46s)

this thing with debugging which can be


[00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m49s)

very convenient so let's just we'll just


[00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:00,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m52s)

fire this guy up and verify that we


[00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:02,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m54s)

actually do the icon thing and so this


[00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m00s)

will actually run go out query all the


[00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m02s)

latest icons on the material design


[00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m04s)

icons dotnet pull them down and build


[00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m07s)

out the e new one of the changes that


[00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m09s)

went in in to 500 I think is rather than


[00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:20,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m13s)

just using one Enuma you because there's


[00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m17s)

a lot of names for a given icon it


[00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:28,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m20s)

actually generates duplicate a new muse


[00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:30,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m23s)

for with the various names for it but


[00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m28s)

then there was a we had a bug with that


[00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m30s)

in that II new members can't differ just


[00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m33s)

by case in the zamel even though they


[00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m34s)

can and c-sharp so there's a fix in here


[00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m37s)

in that it'll only grab the


[00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m39s)

the first I think it's the first one


[00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m41s)

that it sees for casein which i think is


[00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m43s)

fine ish there's probably some special


[00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,539](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m45s)

cases that need to be worked out but I


[00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,419](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m47s)

have not actually gone through the


[00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:57,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m50s)

entire Inu member to make sure so this


[00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:59,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m53s)

guy fires up we hit our breakpoint great


[00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m57s)

so we are actually doing the icons


[00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m59s)

everything works the way we expect and


[00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:10,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m01s)

we'll just let it go so go get me my


[00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:15,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m04s)

icons please and then hopefully this


[00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m10s)

shows us a whole bunch of inium changes


[00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:24,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m15s)

along with a whole lot of zamel changes


[00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:29,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m21s)

as well to go along with the scalar


[00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:31,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m24s)

icons for each of these again one of the


[00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m29s)

things that I am hoping to do is to get


[00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m31s)

this script running automatically like I


[00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m35s)

said either on like a nightly or a


[00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,419](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m36s)

weekly basis just so that we don't fall


[00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m39s)

behind because it very consistently


[00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:47,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m41s)

happens I try to keep an eye on the


[00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m44s)

material design icons but I have a lot


[00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m47s)

of things to keep an eye on and it's


[00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m49s)

very common that they get a release out


[00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:56,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m50s)

and I don't even notice so I do


[00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m53s)

appreciate when people at least let me


[00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,299](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m56s)

know and if people want to submit pull


[00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m57s)

requests where all you do is run the


[00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:02,559](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m59s)

script and say hey there's new icons


[00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:07,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m01s)

here's the pull request for it


[00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:09,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m02s)

even better I approve it can be a quick


[00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m07s)

and easy win because this does take just


[00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m09s)

a minute while that's running Oh show


[00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m12s)

what it's actually doing in here so


[00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m14s)

there's some fancy fancy code in here


[00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m16s)

where it actually so pulls down all the


[00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m19s)

icons updating new the the interesting


[00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m23s)

part in this is the way that it's


[00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m24s)

actually building up the c-sharp so it's


[00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:33,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m26s)

going through some of the code analysis


[00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m30s)

api's to actually go through and build


[00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:39,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m33s)

out the c-sharp so that it's reasonably


[00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m37s)

generated so it's not just doing string


[00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m39s)

munging and string concatenation it's


[00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m41s)

being somewhat intelligent about it and


[00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m44s)

formatting and all of that chess which


[00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:51,679](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m46s)

which makes it much nicer and it also


[00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m49s)

means that it takes it a little bit


[00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m51s)

longer


[00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:01,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m52s)

especially with all of that parsing that


[00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m56s)

is in there what are you though normally


[00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m01s)

doesn't take me this long usually it


[00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m03s)

runs from maybe a minute maybe two it


[00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m07s)

could be because I'm streaming and it


[00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m08s)

doesn't have a lot of stuff because it


[00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m10s)

downloaded that fairly quickly and for


[00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:19,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m13s)

each of these inu members it does have


[00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:21,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m14s)

to loop for a little while I just make


[00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:30,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m19s)

sure we're still chugging along at a


[00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:31,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m21s)

happy clip so far so good okay well well


[00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m30s)

you think about what you've done


[00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:39,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m31s)

no finished excellent okay let's go see


[00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m35s)

what you did and I was on the wrong


[00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:50,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m39s)

branch so we will want to switch back


[00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:57,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m43s)

get me back on master please and pull up


[00:24:50,870 --> 00:25:03,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m50s)

I think we can just whack this other one


[00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:06,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m57s)

here come on I know you want a stache


[00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m03s)

and then pole I should have pulled first


[00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:14,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m06s)

go ahead and think about it and I think


[00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:18,799](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m11s)

we can be done with our resource


[00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:20,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m14s)

generation yeah I know the new version


[00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m18s)

and get crackin occasionally gets itself


[00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m20s)

confused when you try to pull up on


[00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m22s)

things and it can't figure out how to


[00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m23s)

pop its - so let's just clean up this


[00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m26s)

history tree real quick and it'll figure


[00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m28s)

itself out so delete we're gonna pop our


[00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:38,559](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m31s)

stash back on top a master there should


[00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:43,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m35s)

be no conflicts great that looks better


[00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:47,419](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m38s)

okay so come back through here so pack


[00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:52,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m43s)

icon data factory I believe this is


[00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:56,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m47s)

gonna be the one with all of the icon


[00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:59,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m52s)

the actual SVG data yeah so this is one


[00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:02,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m56s)

really really really big line I'm not


[00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m59s)

even gonna try to read it though usually


[00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m02s)

I I will I balled this one so arrow left


[00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:11,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m05s)

right right bow


[00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m06s)

so we picked up quite a few icons


[00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,549](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m12s)

clockwise so this is what you'll notice


[00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m15s)

when I was commenting that it uses all


[00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:22,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m17s)

the e new members for something so


[00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:25,379](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m19s)

there's an icon called Auto renew but it


[00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,799](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m22s)

also has aliases for clockwise arrows


[00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:31,379](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m25s)

circular arrows and circle arrows so you


[00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m28s)

can use any of these inu members but


[00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:34,379](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m31s)

you're still going to end up even though


[00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m33s)

there for any new members you're still


[00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:37,049](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m34s)

going to end up with the same icon in


[00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m35s)

each of them so when you see those


[00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:45,659](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m37s)

that's all that is is different aliases


[00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:47,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m39s)

the same thing there so this looks


[00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:51,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m45s)

pretty good I'm going to assume refiner


[00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:56,879](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m47s)

I was like looking at the removals just


[00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:58,169](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m51s)

to see scatterplot hex bin see the the


[00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:02,509](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m56s)

only thing I don't like about this is


[00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:02,509](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m58s)

this is technically a breaking change oh


[00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:08,999](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m03s)

I should probably call these out so


[00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:11,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m06s)

let's go because I always try to make


[00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:14,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m08s)

sure people know in general we try to


[00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m11s)

follow semver for all of the changes


[00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:22,129](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m14s)

however there's certain breaking changes


[00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:24,149](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m16s)

that I'm willing to allow through


[00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:26,999](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m22s)

without necessarily revving the major


[00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:30,239](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m24s)

version with just the release notes so


[00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m26s)

it's specifically for your pack icons if


[00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,629](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m30s)

you update into a version and you


[00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,999](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m32s)

realize that something's not working


[00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:37,649](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m33s)

check the release notes I've tried to


[00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:41,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m35s)

always call out when one of these


[00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:43,109](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m37s)

changes and what's the the new the new


[00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m41s)

name for it because a lot of times


[00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:50,549](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m43s)

because this is an external dependency


[00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m45s)

when they update things like this simple


[00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:56,789](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m50s)

case in between lowercase P and


[00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:58,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m52s)

uppercase P can cause people problems so


[00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m56s)

just be aware of that


[00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m58s)

let's go through and I just want to


[00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:08,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m00s)

document these guys real quick so I


[00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:13,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m02s)

don't lose track of them so let's jump


[00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:13,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m08s)

over to my releases page and


[00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:28,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m15s)

so I do keep a running release notes


[00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:30,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m21s)

that are on here so these this two 601


[00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m28s)

people won't likely see but let's


[00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m30s)

actually put this as part of the wiki I


[00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m32s)

think is the easier place also in


[00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m35s)

regards to the wiki if people ever want


[00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:45,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m37s)

to help out and edit please feel free to


[00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:46,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m39s)

edit this this is not just my just for


[00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m45s)

me to edit this is it's open to


[00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m46s)

everybody and so if you find something


[00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m49s)

that's wrong or you want to contribute


[00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m51s)

something please feel free you don't


[00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m53s)

necessarily always need to ask question


[00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:58,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m55s)

if it's this looks like you type out


[00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m56s)

something Kevin the answer is I probably


[00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m58s)

type out something a lot of times these


[00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m01s)

are done quickly and I thought I had a


[00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:10,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m03s)

release notes page in here but maybe


[00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m06s)

it's just on the releases page okay


[00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m10s)

maybe it's just here so we're going to


[00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m13s)

edit this one and you'll notice this is


[00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:24,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m15s)

a draft release so you won't necessarily


[00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:26,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m18s)

see you won't necessarily see this


[00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:30,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m24s)

showing up for everybody this is mostly


[00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:34,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m26s)

where I keep my own release notes so


[00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:39,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m30s)

that people can have them I just build


[00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m34s)

them as stuff gets merged so pack icon


[00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:47,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m40s)

[Music]


[00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:50,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m42s)

name changes so we are just going to and


[00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m47s)

I'm trying to remember how to is it one


[00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:59,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m50s)

two three indent I think this is how you


[00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:04,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m54s)

do it yeah or just to indent I think it


[00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:14,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m59s)

just might be to markdown wizard I am


[00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:16,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m04s)

not so this guy was changed to this guy


[00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m14s)

because I'm less concerned with adding


[00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m16s)

in the new ones and more concerned with


[00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m18s)

adding in the breaking icons which is


[00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m22s)

going to be all around these deletes


[00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m25s)

mail email


[00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:45,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m30s)

so this the male alias was just removed


[00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:48,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m41s)

so if you were using male switch to


[00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:53,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m45s)

email and that will take care of that


[00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:55,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m48s)

one okay perfect so keep that draft


[00:30:53,330 --> 00:31:05,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m53s)

going just so that we have those issues


[00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:09,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m55s)

documented and updating pack icons fixes


[00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m05s)

and let's grab that already it's safe


[00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:17,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m09s)

drive tonight


[00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:18,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m10s)

great let's see 12 76 and this one we


[00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m17s)

aren't going to necessarily pull


[00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:28,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m18s)

requests I'm just gonna cowboy it in and


[00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:32,049](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m20s)

be done that should knock another one


[00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,049](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m28s)

off the plate


[00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m34s)

a half-hour in and we've already knocked


[00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m37s)

off most the issues now to be fair I


[00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:46,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m39s)

knocked off all the easy issues so that


[00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:50,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m42s)

guy is now closed okay


[00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:53,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m46s)

so where to go next where to go next


[00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:57,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m50s)

where to go next I think I probably want


[00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,169](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m53s)

to pick on this outline text field box


[00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:08,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m57s)

because if I remember right this one was


[00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:15,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m59s)

the easier one to look at so bug 1282


[00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:20,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m08s)

it's this bug not in this bug didn't get


[00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:26,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m15s)

milestone well let's fix that there we


[00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:29,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m20s)

go so this is the the the issue here so


[00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:32,559](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m26s)

if you go through and create a text box


[00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:35,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m29s)

with the material design outline text


[00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m32s)

field box and set a background on it the


[00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m35s)

background is actually expanding over


[00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:43,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m38s)

the top of this border basically the


[00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,789](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m40s)

border has a rounded color this guy was


[00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m43s)

sitting on top and normally if you don't


[00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:51,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m45s)

set a background color it just lets the


[00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m49s)

border show through and you have no idea


[00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,909](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m51s)

that it's writing on top so but the


[00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m53s)

moment you set a background color you


[00:32:54,909 --> 00:33:02,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m54s)

now get this ugly looking corner and it


[00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:05,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m56s)

ruins the nice rounded edge so we had a


[00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m02s)

wonderful pull request here but I think


[00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,799](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m05s)

for this one we're gonna actually check


[00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:13,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m07s)

it out and make sure everything's are


[00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:17,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m08s)

working so pull requests 1283 so let's


[00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:22,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m13s)

get master should be pulled up let's


[00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:25,539](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m17s)

check out 1283 we'll go take a look at


[00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:27,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m22s)

these changes all it's thinking about


[00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:32,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m25s)

that I just kind of want to eyeball this


[00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:37,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m27s)

so all of these changes here basically


[00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:40,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m32s)

the the change was rather than having


[00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m37s)

the template binding for the background


[00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m40s)

brush being applied to this inner border


[00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:49,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m42s)

to move that template biting to the


[00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:51,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m45s)

outer border which is what actually


[00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:55,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m49s)

ends up getting the corner radius set on


[00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m51s)

it so this is the border inside the one


[00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m55s)

that actually had the gray outline this


[00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:03,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m57s)

is the guy that was able to ride outside


[00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:05,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m00s)

the other thing that would have probably


[00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:09,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m03s)

worked as well is to just apply the


[00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:12,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m05s)

corner radius down here so that this one


[00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,899](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m09s)

also gets clipped appropriately but due


[00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m12s)

to this padding I'm not necessarily sure


[00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:19,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m13s)

if that's the rule that's probably not


[00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:22,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m16s)

the right that's not the right fix I


[00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m19s)

think this is probably the better fix


[00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m22s)

the one thing that I want to look at is


[00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,149](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m24s)

whether we actually need to set the


[00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m26s)

background to transparent or whether we


[00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:34,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m28s)

can just omit it so in WPF there is a


[00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m31s)

difference between not setting a brush


[00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:39,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m34s)

and setting a brush to transparent


[00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:46,419](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m37s)

visually they end up looking the same


[00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:49,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m39s)

but transparent can cause different hit


[00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:51,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m46s)

testing so when you go to click if you


[00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:56,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m49s)

have an element that has a background of


[00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m51s)

transparent it is available for that


[00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m56s)

elements available for hit testing as


[00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m57s)

it's trying to figure out what element


[00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m59s)

is underneath your mouse whereas if you


[00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,859](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m01s)

omit the background altogether it


[00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m03s)

usually won't be hit test visible and


[00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:10,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m05s)

it'll fall all the way through I


[00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m08s)

realized they use the phrase hit test


[00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m10s)

visible and there's a property that


[00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:17,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m12s)

matches that name slightly different so


[00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m15s)

in general if you can avoid setting


[00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:21,609](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m17s)

transparent and just omit the background


[00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m19s)

it's slightly more performant just for


[00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:25,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m21s)

that reason so we're gonna take a peek


[00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m24s)

first of all to make sure that this


[00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m25s)

works which I suspect it does and then


[00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m29s)

we're going to try dropping the


[00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m31s)

background altogether and make sure that


[00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m33s)

it still works and I think that should


[00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:43,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m36s)

be all that it takes so there's that


[00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:46,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m39s)

visual studio reload the universe yep go


[00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m43s)

think about go think about everything


[00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:53,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m46s)

and we'll walk through and do this so


[00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:55,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m48s)

for this issue I think it was as simple


[00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m53s)

as just this guy here and setting the


[00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m55s)

background I tend to pick fuchsia


[00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:02,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m56s)

whenever I want a visual to do because I


[00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m00s)

find fuchsia to be one of


[00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:07,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m02s)

the bigger eyesore colors and so every


[00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m05s)

time I see a large block a few should


[00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m07s)

says ah you forgot to finish something


[00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:17,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m09s)

here some people may use it in their app


[00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:18,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m12s)

I tend to avoid it but that's just me I


[00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m17s)

am also not a designer so I would not


[00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:24,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m18s)

take color advice from me cuz I'm on


[00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:31,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m23s)

visual studio I know this is hard I know


[00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:34,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m24s)

this is hard at some point I am looking


[00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m31s)

at getting a slightly better streaming


[00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m34s)

setup so that I don't have quite this


[00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:42,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m36s)

lag when I'm going through and doing it


[00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m38s)

because just running this is chewing 40%


[00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:48,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m42s)

of my CPU and that doesn't count visual


[00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m44s)

studio and resharper trying to help okay


[00:36:52,830 --> 00:37:00,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m52s)

so that guy is now loaded so let's go up


[00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:02,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m56s)

and first of all let's go change


[00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m00s)

something in our demo apps so that we


[00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m02s)

actually have it because this pull


[00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:12,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m03s)

request only changed the style and we


[00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:16,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m07s)

want to pick on changing the background


[00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m12s)

color of something equivalent so there's


[00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:24,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m16s)

that


[00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:31,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m17s)

oh sure you'll work so background


[00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:34,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m24s)

fuchsia great sorry just checking to see


[00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m31s)

what's going on here so this is the one


[00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:43,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m34s)

next to the checkbox okay perfect so


[00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:43,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m37s)

I'll make sure I'm not completely crazy


[00:37:53,420 --> 00:38:00,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m53s)

sweet well that goes and loads up there


[00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:05,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m58s)

was something I was gonna mention to


[00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:08,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m00s)

there was a awesome control that got so


[00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m05s)

the the term in Android is Action Button


[00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m08s)

and I think that's probably what it's


[00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m11s)

called in the material design spec as


[00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m12s)

well I'd have to double-check but


[00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:23,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m15s)

somebody was asking in the chat about


[00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:26,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m17s)

going through and building one out see


[00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:33,559](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m23s)

if I could find that image real quick


[00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:35,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m26s)

yeah this guy here somebody in the the


[00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:37,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m33s)

get er chat was asking about building up


[00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,519](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m35s)

a control that looked like this and so


[00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m37s)

in the in our library we've already got


[00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:44,539](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m40s)

a pop-up box that has a style where you


[00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:47,569](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m42s)

can effectively get this kind of button


[00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:49,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m44s)

effect going through but our current one


[00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:54,759](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m47s)

doesn't allow for basically having these


[00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:57,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m49s)

labels off to the side so just as a fun


[00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:59,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m54s)

programming problem I may take that on


[00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,359](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m57s)

at some point because this looks like a


[00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,279](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m59s)

fun control to build I personally


[00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:07,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m02s)

haven't needed it in any of my apps but


[00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:10,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m04s)

I know that this is a very common design


[00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:12,259](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m07s)

especially among mobile developers and


[00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,749](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m10s)

so this might be a fun one to build out


[00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:17,089](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m12s)

so that we have a nice simplistic style


[00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:20,569](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m14s)

to work with so if anyone wants to play


[00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:23,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m17s)

around doing that go for it I do think


[00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:25,489](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m20s)

this type of edition because like I said


[00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,009](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m23s)

we've already got the the pop-up box


[00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:29,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m25s)

where it'll take the list of buttons and


[00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:32,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m28s)

style and out like this for you what's


[00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:34,999](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m29s)

missing is the ability to specify this


[00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m32s)

label on top of it which i think would


[00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:41,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m34s)

be a nice addition to the library so


[00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:52,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m38s)

let's go back here and we've got this


[00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:54,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m41s)

guy let's grab our text box fields and


[00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:59,299](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m52s)

we are looking for the big one with a


[00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:03,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m54s)

checkbox that has a lot of fuchsia so


[00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:06,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m59s)

this is going to be a hard one to see so


[00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:08,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m03s)

the magnifier please


[00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:13,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m06s)

because unfortunately we need to zoom


[00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:20,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m08s)

all the way in on this guy so I believe


[00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:25,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m13s)

it is Windows Plus and that looks a lot


[00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:29,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m20s)

better it's now this guy's properly


[00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:32,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m25s)

getting blocked which I believe is the


[00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:34,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m29s)

expected look it is interesting to me


[00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m32s)

that that corner seems to be getting


[00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m34s)

lightened


[00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:44,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m36s)

so let's zoom that back out but that


[00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m39s)

could just be the sub-pixel rendering


[00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:55,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m44s)

and it's interesting to me okay now I


[00:40:51,240 --> 00:41:01,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m51s)

have to look so let's see if we can do


[00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m55s)

this let's remove the background color


[00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m01s)

set it all together and then take a look


[00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m03s)

at that because I think that could just


[00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:12,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m04s)

be the border the way that ends up


[00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:14,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m07s)

looking come on live Sam we'll update oh


[00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m12s)

come on


[00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m14s)

deleting a background color should


[00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m16s)

totally do it oh I guess we can look at


[00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:28,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m18s)

the one down below because it's the same


[00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:31,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m20s)

style look at this corner yeah it must


[00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m28s)

be it must be with the magnifier and the


[00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:37,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m31s)

sub-pixel rendering that on that rounded


[00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m33s)

corner it seems to lighten okay so I'm


[00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m37s)

not gonna I'm not going to stress about


[00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:43,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m39s)

it


[00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m39s)

so that appears to work so the last


[00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:52,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m43s)

thing we want to look at then is on this


[00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:55,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m45s)

style I'm gonna take me there so this


[00:41:52,200 --> 00:42:00,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m52s)

guy here keep going down keep going down


[00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:04,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m55s)

okay so the change here so this is the


[00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:11,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m00s)

the border where the hang on what's


[00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:15,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m04s)

going on what's going on here are we


[00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m11s)

looking at the wrong one textfield no


[00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m15s)

template by it so here's the outer


[00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m17s)

border this is the one where it used to


[00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m19s)

be good


[00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:25,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m20s)

applied it currently as a background of


[00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m22s)

transparent I believe we can just whack


[00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:35,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m25s)

that because harder coding that to


[00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:39,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m28s)

transparent does nothing for us um let's


[00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m35s)

fire that up and make sure we get


[00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:51,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m46s)

let's make sure we pick that that up and


[00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m48s)

as long as that looks the same I think


[00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:56,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m51s)

we'll just update this PR with that


[00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:03,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m53s)

change and merge it in and I think


[00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:06,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m56s)

that'll bring it through then we'll be


[00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m03s)

getting really really close as I'd


[00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m06s)

really like to get this to 6o release


[00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:13,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m08s)

it's been kind of sitting on the the


[00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m10s)

docket ready to go out or wanting to go


[00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m13s)

out for like a month now


[00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:22,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m15s)

and unfortunately due to my lack of free


[00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:24,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m17s)

time it's just been sitting there so I


[00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m22s)

do appreciate everybody submitting


[00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:30,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m24s)

issues and pull requests it's been great


[00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m26s)

there was a question that came up on one


[00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m30s)

of the issues of somebody asking what


[00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m31s)

the holdup was and the short answer is


[00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:38,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m32s)

it's me I only have a certain number of


[00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:41,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m36s)

free hours in a week to devote to open


[00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:44,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m38s)

source work and so I I try to allocate


[00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:48,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m41s)

as many as I can but unfortunately my


[00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:52,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m44s)

current life setup with small children


[00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:55,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m48s)

requires me to focus on them so


[00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m52s)

hopefully that frees up a little bit but


[00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:03,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m55s)

we'll see I enjoy doing this and I do it


[00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:09,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m59s)

a lot for fun so okay so there we are


[00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:13,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m03s)

and windows Plus and same effect on that


[00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:19,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m09s)

corner excellent excellent excellent


[00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:24,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m13s)

excellent excellent excellent perfect so


[00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:27,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m19s)

we can you know put that change in on


[00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:30,930](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m24s)

the pull request so view changes we only


[00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:37,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m27s)

want this change bring it forward please


[00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:38,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m30s)

and then I think that should be it so


[00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:42,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m37s)

it's just the the whacking of the


[00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:48,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m38s)

transparent on the background removing


[00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:51,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m42s)

parent background setter so commit


[00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m48s)

change and again functionally or I


[00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:57,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m51s)

should say visually those two things are


[00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m54s)

identical the only difference and we can


[00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:00,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m57s)

revert this change the only difference


[00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m00s)

be


[00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m00s)

between transparent and unset is a


[00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:10,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m04s)

little bit of performance when it comes


[00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:13,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m06s)

to figuring out what elements you can


[00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m10s)

click on so also if you're wondering


[00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m13s)

like if you're trying to catch Mouse


[00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m14s)

events on like a grid or something and


[00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m17s)

you can't get them that's almost


[00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m19s)

assuredly because there is no background


[00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m21s)

and it's you're not able to register


[00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:30,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m23s)

that so set a background color of


[00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:36,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m28s)

transparent in that case and you will


[00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:40,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m30s)

pick them up so let's to do let me grab


[00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:47,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m36s)

this guy and I think bring this guy back


[00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:47,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m40s)

across so this guy comes in here and


[00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:56,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m47s)

refresh so because now we've got new


[00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m51s)

changes great great


[00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:09,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m57s)

that did not refresh with my change so


[00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:11,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m00s)

let's try one more time github what did


[00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m09s)

I revert the wrong change and push the


[00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:23,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m11s)

other one oh don't tell me I did that oh


[00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:33,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m14s)

I did do that dang it sigh sigh sigh


[00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:42,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m23s)

sigh sigh ok so not this change this


[00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:50,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m33s)

change and you staged all changes and I


[00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:55,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m42s)

think I think it lets me force push


[00:46:50,520 --> 00:47:00,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m50s)

we're gonna find out if not it's a small


[00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:04,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m55s)

enough change to go back so yeah force


[00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:06,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m00s)

bush so when in doubt rewrite get


[00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:10,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m04s)

history and cover over a multitude of


[00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:13,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m06s)

mistakes Hey look at that


[00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:20,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m10s)

see I didn't make a mistake


[00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:20,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m13s)

don't know what you talk about method or


[00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:30,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m21s)

why don't we hit oh because control is


[00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m26s)

no interesting I betcha that was because


[00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:35,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m30s)

we changed the control out from under it


[00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m33s)

and the live sam'l update didn't know


[00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:42,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m35s)

how to handle that that's okay I am less


[00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:47,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m39s)

concerned about those type of issues so


[00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:54,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m42s)

now we refresh hopefully that guy jumps


[00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:59,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m47s)

off okay background is set that is set


[00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:59,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m54s)

we drop this set are all together great


[00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:21,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m07s)

prove that and let's merge it in should


[00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:24,069](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m16s)

probably wait for the checks probably


[00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m21s)

there's like there's no this is the


[00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:30,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m24s)

weird part is there's not actually going


[00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:35,079](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m25s)

to be unit tests on this so we might


[00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:40,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m30s)

just squash a merge and go let's do this


[00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:43,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m35s)

so that goes through and so this guy


[00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m40s)

should be closed this guy now auto


[00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:54,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m43s)

closes and once again we are getting


[00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:56,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m47s)

closer this guy is and I wish there was


[00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m54s)

an easy way to get back to my milestone


[00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m56s)

and that'll work


[00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:08,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m59s)

okay so I think that guy should be


[00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:13,299](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m04s)

closed now and we're down to two so bug


[00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:24,069](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m08s)

or hue slider option anyone have


[00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:25,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m13s)

suggestions do people care we've


[00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:28,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m24s)

reviewed a bunch of PRS let's pick


[00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:32,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m25s)

something we'll just start with the bug


[00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:35,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m28s)

so basically on this one so we added


[00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:39,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m32s)

this new button assist corner radius


[00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:42,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m35s)

right and the the issue being the ripple


[00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:45,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m39s)

itself is now able to ride on top of the


[00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:46,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m42s)

button and so if you're looking closely


[00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,319](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m45s)

you'll notice that the ripple now


[00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m46s)

extends over the top of the button so


[00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:56,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m50s)

let's take a look at fixing it this


[00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:59,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m53s)

shouldn't be too terribly difficult step


[00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:05,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m56s)

one we'll pull in the latest changes on


[00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:05,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m59s)

master switch branches


[00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m08s)

go go go go go


[00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:18,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m11s)

and then I don't need this branch


[00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:23,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m13s)

anymore because we merged it and


[00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m18s)

resharper go ahead and reload everything

[00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:59,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m54s)

time is really bad for a lot of people


[00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,930](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m56s)

throughout most of the world I know that


[00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m59s)

a lot of people that end up watching


[00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:07,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h51m00s)

this are either in the United States or


[00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:09,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h51m02s)

Europe and so in the u.s. it's somewhere


[00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:12,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h51m07s)

between 9:00 and 1:00 a.m. that I start


[00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:14,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h51m09s)

[00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:05,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h51m57s)

already and being used by users or is it

cool I don't know if you noticed but for


[00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:28,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m21s)

people are interested in I did add this


[00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m24s)

page over on the wiki if people want to


[00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,930](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m28s)

show off because I am always curious on


[00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,359](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m30s)

the apps that people go through and


[00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:38,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m31s)

build with this so projects using


[00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:40,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m34s)

material design so if if anybody builds


[00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:43,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m38s)

an app and you are interested in it feel


[00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:47,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m40s)

free to to drop it in here with a link


[00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m43s)

and a screenshot or whatever have it in


[00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m47s)

a little paragraph about what it is


[00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m48s)

because I am happy for people to to show


[00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m50s)

off their stuff in here for my theme


[00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m53s)

selection in your application


[00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,109](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m55s)

awesome yeah if it's something where


[00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m57s)

you're able to at least show a


[00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:04,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m59s)

screenshot in a link I don't care if


[00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:07,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m00s)

it's open-source or something for


[00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:09,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m04s)

enterprise type work if you're able to


[00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m07s)

share it and show off I think a lot of


[00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:16,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m09s)

people enjoy seeing the the types of


[00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:18,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m11s)

stuff other people build okay so color


[00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:23,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m16s)

picker and I think if I okay resharper


[00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:26,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m18s)

reload I think if I remember right did


[00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:29,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m23s)

you because there was the changes for


[00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:35,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m26s)

the color picker control directly and


[00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:36,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m29s)

then okay sweet so I think what we'll do


[00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:42,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m35s)

is I'll just fire this up in the demo


[00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:47,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m36s)

app and then try talking this just with


[00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:50,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m42s)

the live sam'l edit and see and see how


[00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:52,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m47s)

it looks but I assume if it does let's


[00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:58,869](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m50s)

see what do we got


[00:53:52,240 --> 00:54:04,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m52s)

so style for the repeat button target


[00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:06,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m58s)

I'll repeat button is are these


[00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,619](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m04s)

different styles in here just because of


[00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:11,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m06s)

the different orientations I assume


[00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:17,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m08s)

vertical and horizontal have slightly


[00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:25,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m11s)

different layouts okay that's what I


[00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:27,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m17s)

thought oh good we kind of already named


[00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m25s)

it that way


[00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:38,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m30s)

perfect reorder some slider vertical


[00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:50,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m38s)

retention reorienting let's press and


[00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:52,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m43s)

hold an abled oh nice I often times free


[00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:56,549](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m50s)

forget about some of the stylist stuff


[00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:59,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m52s)

oh but I guess that wasn't there prior


[00:54:56,549 --> 00:55:02,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m56s)

so that could have been Robert Snipes


[00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:04,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m59s)

that put that in that is one thing that


[00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:07,359](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m02s)

I am always somewhat sloppy about


[00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m04s)

because most of the time for my WPF apps


[00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:13,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m07s)

I'm not dealing with touch interaction


[00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m10s)

so I do technically have a surface go I


[00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:19,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m13s)

could I could test things on with a


[00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,799](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m16s)

touch screen but for people who keep an


[00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m19s)

eye out for stuff like the stylus and


[00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m20s)

the touch interaction I do appreciate


[00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:27,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m22s)

that because that is always a one of


[00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:34,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m25s)

those blind spots that bites me every so


[00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:37,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m27s)

often i panelist you sided position so


[00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:41,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m34s)

that just moves that guy around inside


[00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:45,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m37s)

of the doc panel and that moves it okay


[00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:46,569](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m41s)

sweet let's see how it rolls look I mean


[00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:49,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m45s)

it all looks I don't see anything


[00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:51,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m46s)

jumping out at me so as long as it works


[00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:55,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m49s)

I see no reason we can't just merge this


[00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m51s)

guy in so let's fire it up and see how


[00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m55s)

it goes


[00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:08,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m55s)

I believe that guy is going to be the


[00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:09,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m00s)

color tool so let's do there is kind of


[00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m08s)

an outstanding item I know I've


[00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:15,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m09s)

mentioned it on stream before of things


[00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:19,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m12s)

that that need to get done is there is


[00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:21,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m15s)

your app will behave very weird if you


[00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:23,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m19s)

try to use the new to 6/0 theming


[00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:27,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m21s)

libraries in combination with the old


[00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:31,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m23s)

palette helper methods it won't work


[00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:33,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m27s)

right the one is expecting to replace


[00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,559](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m31s)

and one is expecting to append to the


[00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m33s)

resource dictionary and so you'll end up


[00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:39,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m35s)

with extra resources things won't change


[00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m37s)

or you'll get sort of it changed the


[00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m39s)

first time but not the second


[00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m41s)

type behavior so don't do that at some


[00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m45s)

point and I don't know if I'll get to it


[00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:52,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m47s)

before to 600 releases I want to go


[00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:55,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m50s)

through the demo app and remove all of


[00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m52s)

the old palette helper invocations those


[00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m55s)

methods are still going to be there and


[00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:00,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m56s)

they still work so if you upgrade to to


[00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m58s)

600 and you don't want to do the new


[00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m00s)

theming stuff and you're using the old


[00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m01s)

API is great you can leave it it all


[00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:08,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m04s)

works just fine the only thing you can't


[00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m06s)

do is mix the old API s and the new API


[00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:13,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m08s)

is together so if you start switching


[00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m11s)

over the API calls change them all over


[00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:19,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m13s)

don't change half of them or you will


[00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m15s)

have a bad day because unfortunately I


[00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:24,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m19s)

don't know of a way to change that


[00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m21s)

without implementing breaking changes so


[00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:30,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m24s)

okay so and I believe it's this guy


[00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:33,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m27s)

right here so that defaults to the


[00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:41,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m30s)

bottom and let's go find where this guy


[00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:43,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m33s)

is located so color picker uniform grade


[00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:46,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m41s)

uniform grid secondary I'm already I'm


[00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:51,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m43s)

at the uniform grids I'm too low this


[00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:57,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m46s)

guy should have been above me selection


[00:57:51,070 --> 00:58:05,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m51s)

controls oh come on where are you what's


[00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:14,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m57s)

the name of this guy color picker there


[00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:18,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m05s)

we go so let's do something like you you


[00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m14s)

slider doc wasn't it


[00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:30,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m21s)

come on some intellisense would be great


[00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:30,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m26s)

some intellisense would be great


[00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:42,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m30s)

slight a position okay so let's go there


[00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:43,619](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m35s)

oh that looked are there nice that is


[00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:54,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m42s)

interesting


[00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:56,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m43s)

so uh so left bottom it's probably part


[00:58:54,099 --> 00:59:00,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m54s)

of the live zamel thing changing the


[00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:07,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m56s)

dock it's causing it to reset the slider


[00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:10,839](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m00s)

position that's probably okay because


[00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:14,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m07s)

ultimately what's happening is well


[00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:16,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m10s)

let's look I think the answer is it's


[00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,869](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m14s)

swapping out one of the data templates


[00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:24,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m16s)

with the style trigger which is somewhat


[00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:26,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m19s)

expected nope wrong project let's go


[00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:29,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m24s)

look real quick that's probably okay I


[00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:32,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m26s)

don't I think most people are probably


[00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:40,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m29s)

gonna have their so let's let's do this


[00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:43,569](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m32s)

real quick set it to the right this is


[00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:47,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m40s)

nice I am wondering what's causing this


[00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:47,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m43s)

extra margin at the top and bottom


[00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:54,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m48s)

verses when I put it on the bottom


[00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:59,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m50s)

it's that same margin there I guess it


[00:59:54,790 --> 01:00:02,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m54s)

is it is shortened okay


[00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:06,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m59s)

let's do this I just want to relaunch


[01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:09,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m02s)

and make sure that this slider position


[01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:13,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m06s)

because I know the live zamel edit and


[01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:14,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m09s)

continue does very bizarre weird things


[01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:16,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m13s)

at times


[01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:19,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m14s)

and I just want to make sure that when


[01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:21,079](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m16s)

we load it up this guy was setting an


[01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:23,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m19s)

initial color and I just want to make


[01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:25,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m21s)

sure that that when the slider is docked


[01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:27,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m23s)

vertically that it reloads that color


[01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:29,799](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m25s)

correctly which I assume it does because


[01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:34,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m27s)

there was nothing in those templates


[01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:38,059](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m29s)

that should cause any breakage and if


[01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:41,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m34s)

you're using this control in your apt


[01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:43,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m38s)

I'd just be aware that at least in the


[01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m41s)

demo app I put this delay on here


[01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:48,319](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m43s)

because the app gets pretty laggy I've


[01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,549](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m46s)

wanted to go back and look at the


[01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m48s)

performance and see what can be done


[01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:56,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m49s)

about it but ultimately it ends up doing


[01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:59,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m52s)

a couple color conversions while you're


[01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m56s)

dragging so it converts it to HSV color


[01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:05,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m59s)

space does the conversion and then


[01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:08,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m02s)

converts it back to RGB so it tends to


[01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:10,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m05s)

be a little slow and so I put this delay


[01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:12,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m08s)

on the binding just to keep the thing


[01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m10s)

relatively responsive you may need to


[01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m12s)

play with that a little on yours at some


[01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:18,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m14s)

point I suspect we're gonna need to do


[01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m16s)

something a little a little nicer but I


[01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:26,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m18s)

don't know how to quite get around it oh


[01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:28,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m22s)

yeah that works right yeah then added


[01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:38,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m26s)

more conversions after that that makes


[01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:38,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m28s)

sense yeah so I like it


[01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:54,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m39s)

I like it tied and then this guy here


[01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:56,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m47s)

should just magically work I'm one so


[01:01:54,490 --> 01:02:00,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m54s)

one last thing I want to check so there


[01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:03,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m56s)

are the I made the mistake of actually


[01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:06,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m00s)

writing unit s over this control but I


[01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m03s)

don't think there's anything in here


[01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:13,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m06s)

that really makes that big of a


[01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:18,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m08s)

difference dragging the slider huge


[01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:20,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m13s)

changes the slider yeah I'm a little


[01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:22,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m18s)

less concerned so there's this really


[01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:26,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m20s)

weird fine line about unit testing a


[01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:28,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m22s)

theme library like this I feel like we


[01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m26s)

should unit test the controls themselves


[01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m28s)

because there's functionality in there


[01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:34,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m30s)

that should be unit tested but obviously


[01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:36,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m32s)

we can't test things like the style


[01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:41,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m34s)

triggers in the sample those are either


[01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:46,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m36s)

UI tests or actual like code monkey run


[01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:53,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m41s)

the test and given that this thing


[01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:57,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m46s)

clearly passed CI I believe yep I'm


[01:02:53,890 --> 01:03:05,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m53s)

gonna say it looks good so great worked


[01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:05,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m57s)

I'd I will take it so approve


[01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:21,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m08s)

and submit review and we will merge that


[01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:24,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m11s)

in and now we'll go and fix a bug and I


[01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:28,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m21s)

think I think we might get this hole to


[01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m24s)

six oh release all knocked out the door


[01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:37,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m30s)

awesome and so if you're wanting to pull


[01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:40,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m34s)

the latest stuff tied up vert should


[01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m37s)

have it's probably just kicking off like


[01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m40s)

crazy


[01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:48,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m41s)

it runs NuGet packages on every commit


[01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:51,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m43s)

to master Oh glad glad to enjoy have you


[01:03:48,910 --> 01:04:03,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m48s)

been using it in your new app the the


[01:03:51,340 --> 01:04:06,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m51s)

two 6o deeming stuff I mean awesome


[01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:09,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m03s)

and I'm guessing based upon that it's


[01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:12,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m06s)

been working working rather well which


[01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:15,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m09s)

is which is good I I've been trying to


[01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:16,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m12s)

see if people are actually using the


[01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:18,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m15s)

preview nougats so I try to watch the


[01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m16s)

download numbers just to see if if it's


[01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:23,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m18s)

actually getting tested I hate to push


[01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:26,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m21s)

stuff out and then find out breaking


[01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:30,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m23s)

issues later Oh awesome that is what we


[01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:32,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m26s)

like to hear so I can only claim some of


[01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:35,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m30s)

the credit for the new theming stuff


[01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:38,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m32s)

Robert snipe did a lot of the initial


[01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:43,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m35s)

work including that color picker control


[01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:44,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m38s)

I just came behind him and got stuff


[01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m43s)

merged in and took credit for a lot of


[01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:51,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m44s)

stuff so but he actually did a lot of


[01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:54,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m47s)

the work and there's actually more


[01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:57,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m51s)

features potentially coming with it


[01:04:54,660 --> 01:05:00,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m54s)

there was we kind of scrapped he has


[01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:02,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m57s)

several additional pieces that he wanted


[01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:05,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m00s)

data into it that I wasn't sure we're


[01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:07,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m02s)

fully ready yet or we're still being


[01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:10,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m05s)

worked on and so we got kind of the the


[01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:12,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m07s)

core theming stuff changed and in but I


[01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:18,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m10s)

think it laid a much better foundation


[01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:21,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m12s)

for stuff coming forward so let's go


[01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m18s)

back to that milestone and night that


[01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m21s)

last


[01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m21s)

ugh


[01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:45,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m32s)

so 1288 okay so this guy I'm gonna close


[01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:49,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m43s)

so the visual studio doesn't freak out


[01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:51,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m45s)

which it's about to and then we'll see


[01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:53,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m49s)

about finding that I think the issue is


[01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:55,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m51s)

probably just where the ripples being


[01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m53s)

applied with the corner radius


[01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:59,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m55s)

I'm hoping it's as simple as maybe


[01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:01,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m57s)

setting click the bounds on on something


[01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m59s)

but I haven't actually looked in at this


[01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:11,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m01s)

code yet to know where it is so I'm


[01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:13,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m03s)

going at it kind of blind so is this


[01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:18,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m11s)

stuff kind of like a hobby for you tight


[01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:18,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m13s)

or is this actually for work


[01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:28,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m19s)

incidentally I'm working on one or two


[01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:33,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m22s)

more oh cool oh wow that's it is a fun


[01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:36,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m28s)

hobby so on your color conversion stuff


[01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:38,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m33s)

if there's anything you want to


[01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:41,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m36s)

contribute back on that I would be


[01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:43,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m38s)

curious to see it I believe and let me


[01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:47,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m41s)

let me go and look I can't remember


[01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:51,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m43s)

where this landed but there was so there


[01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:55,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m47s)

are some additional color space ones in


[01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:57,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m51s)

this color manipulation yeah yeah these


[01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m55s)

ones here I had gone through and marked


[01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:01,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m57s)

them as internal because they weren't


[01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m59s)

actually being used yet and I didn't


[01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m01s)

want so me being lazy I didn't want to


[01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:08,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m04s)

make them part of our public API if I


[01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:12,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m05s)

wasn't ready to eat to actually support


[01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:15,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m08s)

them but there there's probably some


[01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:17,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m12s)

good use cases for being able to bring


[01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:19,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m15s)

these other color spaces forward and


[01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:22,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m17s)

potentially have the the color picker


[01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:25,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m19s)

maybe have an option on their for pick


[01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:26,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m22s)

the color space you want to work in that


[01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:28,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m25s)

way people can kind of get back the


[01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m26s)

values that they want and maybe


[01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:35,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m28s)

potentially avoid some of those odd


[01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:37,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m30s)

conversions so stuff stuff to be done


[01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m35s)

I've done enough stuff with fun color


[01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:42,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m37s)

spaces and computer vision that it's


[01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m40s)

it's interesting I figured you wanted to


[01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m42s)

keep this simple


[01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:48,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m44s)

yeah at least at least for this release


[01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m46s)

I want to keep it simple but I wouldn't


[01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:54,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m48s)

mind if you 1d they're open like a pull


[01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:57,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m51s)

request or an issue and just show what


[01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:59,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m54s)

you ended up doing seeing how other


[01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m57s)

people have built out stuff sometimes is


[01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:06,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m59s)

really helpful and kind of trying to


[01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:08,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m01s)

shape the API just so that it at least


[01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:10,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m06s)

meets one person's use case if not


[01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:13,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m08s)

necessarily everybody's cool


[01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:17,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m10s)

yeah I'll always love looking at


[01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:20,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m13s)

people's stuff okay so let's let's jump


[01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:24,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m17s)

in here and this is gonna be the button


[01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:27,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m20s)

stuff and I think was it you tied that


[01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:29,819](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m24s)

went through and separated out the the


[01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m27s)

button pages on the demo app trying to


[01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:37,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m29s)

remember I know I had open Oh it's


[01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:40,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m32s)

easier to critique they create amen amen


[01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:43,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m37s)

yeah perfect yeah cuz that thank you for


[01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:46,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m40s)

that by the way this is areas of this


[01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:48,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m43s)

demo app they just kind of grow and get


[01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:52,319](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m46s)

out of hand and then I realize usually


[01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:54,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m48s)

too late that that we've got a mess on


[01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m52s)

our hands so I do appreciate the help in


[01:08:54,540 --> 01:09:03,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m54s)

getting that stuff fixed so let's take a


[01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:09,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m56s)

look where is the corner radius ones


[01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:13,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m03s)

buttons with corner radius so that'll


[01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:16,319](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m09s)

work there let's see here corner radius


[01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:19,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m13s)

let's just fire this up real quick and


[01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:23,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m16s)

make sure that we can recreate the


[01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:25,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m19s)

problem a step one is always recreate


[01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m23s)

the problem first and then actually


[01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:28,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m25s)

verify you fix it


[01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:46,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m41s)

so if this is a hobby project for you


[01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m44s)

tide is your does that mean the app that


[01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:49,299](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m46s)

you're building with it is open source


[01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:58,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m47s)

or something that you're keeping closed


[01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:59,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m49s)

source for now come on is Justin to you


[01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:03,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m58s)

you can do it


[01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m59s)

I know recompiling is hard


[01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:17,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m10s)

gotcha


[01:10:13,159 --> 01:10:19,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m13s)

cool yeah and if you ever want somebody


[01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m17s)

to take a look at it or critique it I


[01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m19s)

know there's been several people who


[01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:24,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m20s)

have posted apps and have just asked for


[01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m21s)

feedback I'm a little unusual in that I


[01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:32,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m24s)

love doing code reviews for people I


[01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:35,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m27s)

know that usually my co-workers laugh at


[01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:39,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m32s)

me for that one but I actually enjoy


[01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:43,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m35s)

doing them so I found out recently that


[01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:46,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m39s)

on github you can take a look at your


[01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:47,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m43s)

contributions and I noticed that my code


[01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m46s)

reviews on pull requests are almost as


[01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:54,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m47s)

high as my pull requests themselves


[01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m49s)

which is fun yeah like I said especially


[01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m54s)

people have been helping contribute to


[01:10:56,389 --> 01:11:01,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m56s)

the library I don't mind helping out and


[01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:04,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m58s)

at least reviewing somebody's app and


[01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:06,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m01s)

pointing out stuff that I see where was


[01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:08,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m04s)

I going buttons buttons I was doing


[01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:11,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m06s)

corner radiuses that's where we were


[01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:18,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m08s)

okay so let's see here if we can


[01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:20,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m11s)

actually I need to adjust this has this


[01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:23,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m18s)

been fixed already


[01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m20s)

20 50 corner radius okay so let's go


[01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:31,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m23s)

back and make sure I'm not not crazy


[01:11:26,179 --> 01:11:36,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m26s)

so so specifically throwing a feedback


[01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:39,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m31s)

on there so that we have a better color


[01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:42,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m36s)

to look at and I am apparently not the


[01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:48,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m39s)

only one who enjoys fuchsia as my to do


[01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:52,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m42s)

color that does not appear to have


[01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:56,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m48s)

gotten applied 2050 radius that is that


[01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:58,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m52s)

one so let's let's restart this is again


[01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m56s)

one of those areas the the custom


[01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:05,659](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m58s)

attached properties the edit and


[01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:11,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m01s)

continued just seems to fall apart on it


[01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:13,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m05s)

is getting better but not perfect I


[01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:15,679](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m11s)

think the line I normally use with


[01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:20,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m13s)

people is it it works great right up


[01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:22,699](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m15s)

until the point where it doesn't but I


[01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m20s)

usually I know people have commented a


[01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:26,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m22s)

lot about different issues with the


[01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m23s)

visual studio designer and I know


[01:12:26,389 --> 01:12:28,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m26s)

there's air


[01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:30,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m26s)

is of this library that don't


[01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:34,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m28s)

necessarily play nice with the designer


[01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m30s)

a lot of that comes from the fact that I


[01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:39,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m34s)

know at least me and several other


[01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:41,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m37s)

people that do a lot of WPF development


[01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:45,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m39s)

one of the first things we usually do is


[01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:46,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m41s)

turn off the designer it can be really


[01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m45s)

helpful when you're learning to try to


[01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m46s)

figure out how to lay things out but a


[01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:52,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m48s)

lot of times I find that it just gets in


[01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:54,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m50s)

the way and I would rather use the live


[01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m52s)

at it and continue to know rather than


[01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:58,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m54s)

having to design that shows me what my


[01:12:56,090 --> 01:13:00,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m56s)

app might look like the Edit continue


[01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:08,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m58s)

shows me what may happen does look like


[01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:14,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m00s)

which is what I would prefer something's


[01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:18,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m08s)

wrong did this actually okay so I'm


[01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:21,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m14s)

either on the wrong button or this


[01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:28,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m18s)

didn't actually pick up the right bit is


[01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:36,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m21s)

there another 25 no this should be here


[01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:42,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m28s)

a tool tip my crazy button with rounded


[01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:46,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m36s)

corners that's rounded top corners with


[01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:48,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m42s)

rounded corners ah ha ha I think I am


[01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:51,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m46s)

looking at the wrong one there we are


[01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:56,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m48s)

there we go now we can see it there's


[01:13:51,620 --> 01:14:00,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m51s)

the fuchsia and it is clearly going


[01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:02,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m56s)

outside okay who just carried myself for


[01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m00s)

a minute so say I didn't think I had


[01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:10,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m02s)

merged in any changes that should have


[01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:16,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m03s)

addressed this so thank you tide let's


[01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:20,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m10s)

go through okay so and actually maybe we


[01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:25,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m16s)

just start and follow it through from


[01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:29,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m20s)

here and go here okay so I was on the


[01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:32,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m25s)

right style so let's take a little


[01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:35,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m29s)

gander at where all this stuff goes so


[01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:40,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m32s)

corner radius is being applied here and


[01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:46,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m35s)

the ripple is set out here so


[01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:50,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m40s)

yep that'll do it that will do it


[01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:52,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m46s)

so the ripples going to ride on top this


[01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:57,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m50s)

guy's going to get a corner radius


[01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:59,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m52s)

applied and this guy won't pick it up so


[01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:02,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m57s)

the first question is does ripple


[01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:06,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m59s)

support corner radius it's a Content


[01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:08,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m02s)

controls the answer is no you sure


[01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:11,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m06s)

content control doesn't have a corner


[01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:19,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m08s)

radius because I thought it was only on


[01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:22,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m11s)

certain things that have borders yeah so


[01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:25,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m19s)

no corner radius there but let's go and


[01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:27,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m22s)

look at the ripple control because I


[01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:31,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m25s)

wondering if the solution is simply to


[01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:36,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m27s)

add the corner radius into the ripple


[01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:38,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m31s)

that must be in the generic so for


[01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m36s)

anybody going through trying to find


[01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:43,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m38s)

where things are typically the themes


[01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:46,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m40s)

are all under a corresponding name with


[01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:49,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m43s)

the control however there's a default


[01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:55,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m46s)

generic one that contains a lot of just


[01:15:49,190 --> 01:16:00,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m49s)

the standard ones so let's just collapse


[01:15:55,310 --> 01:16:05,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m55s)

the vigil state manager for now and this


[01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:10,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m00s)

is effectively where the problem is okay


[01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:14,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m05s)

so I think the only option then is to


[01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:14,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m10s)

wrap this guy in a border and clip him


[01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:29,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m17s)

is that correct I think it is the


[01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:40,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m26s)

problem is then I need to pull all this


[01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:45,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m29s)

stuff out yeah because if I have a


[01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:45,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m40s)

horizontal content alignment of centered


[01:16:46,210 --> 01:17:00,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m46s)

and a corner radius I expect it to still


[01:16:51,620 --> 01:17:04,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m51s)

be clipped so oh boy this is going to


[01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:07,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m00s)

get interesting fast because if I wrap


[01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:08,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m04s)

this well okay so the fix for this is


[01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:20,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m07s)

going to have to start going down this


[01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:24,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m08s)

path so you get inside so then we want


[01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:29,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m20s)

this guy to pick up the corner radius


[01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:34,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m24s)

same as what that guy does and then more


[01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:38,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m29s)

importantly we want clip to bounds to be


[01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:39,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m34s)

true so if we set a major corner radius


[01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m38s)

on this guy


[01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:45,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m39s)

it's going to go through and effectively


[01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:50,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m41s)

clip it however this isn't quite going


[01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:55,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m45s)

to work nicely so this will fix our


[01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:58,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m50s)

immediate problem so if we relaunch this


[01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m55s)

should address the first problem however


[01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:02,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m58s)

I think we're still going to have an


[01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:05,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m59s)

issue if we have say a horizontal


[01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:07,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m02s)

content alignment of centered say we


[01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:11,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m05s)

bring the the content of the button in


[01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:12,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m07s)

tiny and then you click on it I would


[01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:15,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m11s)

still expect the ripple to be around


[01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:16,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m12s)

that you know centered portion rather


[01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m15s)

than being able to expand outside of it


[01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:22,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m16s)

night and this will still allow it to


[01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:24,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m18s)

expand but one problem at a time


[01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:26,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m22s)

well make sure this properly clips and


[01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:30,219](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m24s)

then we'll set up the failure case and


[01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:32,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m26s)

verify that we can fix it properly


[01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:37,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m30s)

and I think we might end up actually let


[01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:42,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m32s)

me just make let's just make both of


[01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:47,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m37s)

these buttons go fuchsia that way we've


[01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:50,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m42s)

got two test cases to play with the


[01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:53,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m47s)

other thing is the live Sam will edit


[01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:56,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m50s)

and continue does not really play nice


[01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:59,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m53s)

when you you're editing control Styles


[01:18:56,550 --> 01:19:05,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m56s)

it sometimes updates but I found that


[01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:07,949](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m59s)

more often than not it just fails which


[01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,949](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m05s)

is frustrating


[01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:22,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m15s)

so tied while I have you here something


[01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m20s)

I had been contemplating doing is


[01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:29,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m22s)

basically putting together a series of


[01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:31,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m24s)

streams and videos one on techniques on


[01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:34,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m29s)

using snoop and then another on just


[01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:38,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m31s)

sort of generic WPF development


[01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:40,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m34s)

specifically mvvm patterns are either of


[01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:54,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m38s)

those things were those be interesting


[01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:56,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m40s)

to you see here no clipping yes both


[01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:58,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m54s)

okay good to know


[01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:01,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m56s)

I started to kind of just write out


[01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:10,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m58s)

outlines of what I wanted to cover for


[01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:10,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m01s)

those so why did that not clip so


[01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:17,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m10s)

background blue be bold obnoxious for me


[01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:22,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m19s)

those


[01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:39,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m25s)

to work but why how are you still able


[01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:41,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m34s)

to float over the top of that okay I'm


[01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:44,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m39s)

somewhat confused


[01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:50,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m41s)

Oh are you living inside of an adorned


[01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:54,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m44s)

are is that how you're able to do it no


[01:20:50,610 --> 01:21:01,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m50s)

this is just a canvas with an ellipse


[01:20:54,150 --> 01:21:08,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m54s)

and the visual state manager I assume


[01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:13,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m01s)

just animates it yeah scale X scale Y


[01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:17,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m08s)

and opacity yeah nothing fancy on either


[01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:21,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m13s)

of those it literally just animates an


[01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:30,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m17s)

ellipse inside of a canvas so why are


[01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:32,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m21s)

you not clipping oh do I have this


[01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m30s)

backwards


[01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:43,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m35s)

to take a look okay


[01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:48,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m41s)

losing faith in live sama let it and


[01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:51,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m43s)

continue snoop it is because snoop I


[01:21:48,390 --> 01:22:02,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m48s)

know so this is the one big advantage of


[01:21:51,180 --> 01:22:06,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m51s)

that I like of snoop over the wou win32


[01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:10,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m02s)

exception okay


[01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:16,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m06s)

I'm guessing snoop we had a little fight


[01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:19,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m10s)

between the live sam'l edit continue and


[01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:22,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m16s)

snoop the the big advantage though that


[01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:25,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m19s)

I like over snoop is to a fault it will


[01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:28,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m22s)

try and let you modify absolutely


[01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m25s)

anything whether it be properties on


[01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:34,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m28s)

your backing view models just randomly


[01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:36,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m30s)

invoking methods it'll it gives you a


[01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:38,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m34s)

lot of string to hang yourself and you


[01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:41,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m36s)

can use snoop to get your apps into very


[01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:44,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m38s)

very broken states the ones that your


[01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:46,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m41s)

users should never be able to get to but


[01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:48,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m44s)

at the same time it can be quite helpful


[01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:50,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m46s)

in that it lets you modify stuff at


[01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:52,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m48s)

runtime and go through and do it so


[01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m50s)

that's the good where's the visual


[01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:58,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m52s)

studio editor is a lot more restrictive


[01:22:54,780 --> 01:23:01,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m54s)

and what it lets you edit and modify


[01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m58s)

with that said the visual studio editor


[01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:05,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m01s)

does have the advantage because it has


[01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:08,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m02s)

the context of your source code it can


[01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:10,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m05s)

do things like click to show me where


[01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:12,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m08s)

this style is declared in my source code


[01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m10s)

and so it can help you navigate up those


[01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:16,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m12s)

Styles a little bit easier so there's a


[01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:20,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m14s)

couple tasks that it does better than


[01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:22,739](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m16s)

snoop but for what I tend to do you


[01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m20s)

snoop for which is a lot of visual


[01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:27,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m22s)

debugging of okay where did this why am


[01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:29,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m25s)

I getting this color where did this come


[01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m27s)

from why is this property not being set


[01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:35,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m29s)

or in this case why is my ripple not


[01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:38,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m30s)

properly being clipped in those cases I


[01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:42,989](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m35s)

I find snoop is just so much easier to


[01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:45,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m38s)

work with over the visual studio one but


[01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:48,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m42s)

it also could be my bias I have also


[01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:51,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m45s)

spent a lot a lot more years with snoop


[01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:54,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m48s)

in the visual studio one okay so snoop


[01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:59,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m51s)

binoculars target our window and then


[01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:00,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m54s)

we'll navigate okay don't worry about


[01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:04,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m59s)

the blue let's just verify we're still


[01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:05,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m00s)

broken yeah and then the big secret was


[01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m04s)

snoop is you put your mouse over the


[01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:12,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m05s)

control you want and hold control shift


[01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:14,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m07s)

and it automatically searches and finds


[01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:17,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m12s)

the control inside of the visual tree


[01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:19,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m14s)

it's worth noting it tends to find the


[01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:22,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m17s)

innermost control that it can hit test


[01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m19s)

inside of the visual tree whereas like


[01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:26,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m22s)

the visual studio one typically uses the


[01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:30,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m24s)

logical tree and would like stop at the


[01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:35,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m26s)

button which is more often what you want


[01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:39,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m30s)

so this is our ripple this is our border


[01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:40,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m35s)

this is where we automatically set our


[01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:45,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m39s)

blue so let's just turn that off for a


[01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:48,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m40s)

minute and this border should have a


[01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:57,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m45s)

corner radius set on it


[01:24:48,910 --> 01:25:02,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m48s)

corner radius 25 25 25 which should be


[01:24:57,070 --> 01:25:11,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m57s)

clipping but it's clearly not clipped


[01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:15,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m02s)

two bounds is true what the heck okay so


[01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:17,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m11s)

inside of my grid I have a canvas inside


[01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:19,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m15s)

of my canvas I have an ellipse which is


[01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:24,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m17s)

not visible


[01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:26,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m19s)

there's my canvas there height width and


[01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:31,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m24s)

then the content presenter is the stuff


[01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:31,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m26s)

actually inside of this


[01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:43,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m35s)

the ripple is there let's jump back here


[01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:46,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m40s)

real quick to this button so this is the


[01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:50,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m43s)

background of the button I got the


[01:25:46,429 --> 01:25:52,699](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m46s)

corner radius applied so effectively


[01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:54,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m50s)

we've got a so we can ignore the


[01:25:52,699 --> 01:25:57,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m52s)

progress bar for the moment because this


[01:25:54,170 --> 01:26:00,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m54s)

is just for the progress button stuff in


[01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:03,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m57s)

fact we can self close that tag so the


[01:26:00,429 --> 01:26:06,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m00s)

progress bar or both of these are


[01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:07,699](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m03s)

sitting in an adorned or decorator so


[01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:11,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m06s)

they're sitting in at the adorne or


[01:26:07,699 --> 01:26:14,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m07s)

level there's a grid whose only purpose


[01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:18,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m11s)

is because we have multiple children and


[01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:20,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m14s)

one needs to sit on top of the other a


[01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:23,929](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m18s)

border with the background of the button


[01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:26,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m20s)

that's getting applied and it gets a


[01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:28,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m23s)

corner radius and what not applied but


[01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:30,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m26s)

the key part is the content for the


[01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:34,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m28s)

button isn't directly inside of this


[01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:35,929](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m30s)

border it's over here and the content


[01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:39,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m34s)

for the button sits inside of the ripple


[01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:43,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m35s)

and the ripple is where our problem is


[01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:46,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m39s)

because this guy will just turn this guy


[01:26:43,969 --> 01:26:53,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m43s)

off hopefully it doesn't break snoop all


[01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:55,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m46s)

all over the place yeah


[01:26:53,420 --> 01:27:03,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m53s)

edit and reload caused all the content


[01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:07,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m55s)

to die but that's fine I am clip two


[01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:07,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m03s)

bounds is set to true on the ripple


[01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:22,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m10s)

why are you why is that not being


[01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:25,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m16s)

clipped I am actually baffled on this as


[01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:28,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m22s)

to why this guy is not properly clipping


[01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:36,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m25s)

because in general that is exactly what


[01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:40,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m28s)

clips to bounds should do maybe I am


[01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m36s)

missing something obvious here


[01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:51,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m47s)

because normally so because you there's


[01:27:50,150 --> 01:28:00,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m50s)

other fun tricks that you can do with


[01:27:51,800 --> 01:28:02,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m51s)

like oh oh is that the problem does it


[01:28:00,199 --> 01:28:06,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m00s)

need to be masked off so there's another


[01:28:02,389 --> 01:28:09,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m02s)

property on here that's common with like


[01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:13,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m06s)

a pasty mess let's take a quick look


[01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:17,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m09s)

over at the color zone I think is also


[01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:21,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m13s)

in generic because there is a feature I


[01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:24,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m17s)

put on the color zone a while back where


[01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:27,949](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m21s)

you could control the which sides of it


[01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:34,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m24s)

the shadow appeared on and it does it


[01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:34,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m27s)

using the same sort of trick where it


[01:28:34,929 --> 01:28:40,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m34s)

clips off the shadow at the sides where


[01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:42,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m37s)

it doesn't want it on there so clips to


[01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:48,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m40s)

bounds true


[01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:56,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m42s)

let's see grid opacity mask shadow edge


[01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:59,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m48s)

converter and interesting so let me


[01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:02,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m56s)

remind myself how this actually works


[01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:05,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m59s)

because I don't actually remember so


[01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:08,239](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m02s)

pulls the thing through verifies the


[01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:11,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m05s)

values are the types expected verifies


[01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:15,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m08s)

we don't have Nan's or infinities grabs


[01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:22,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m11s)

the drop shadow and builds a rectangular


[01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:27,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m15s)

based upon it and then does a drawing


[01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:31,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m22s)

brush with white aka turn all the bits


[01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:35,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m27s)

on because no pasty mask is a bitwise


[01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:39,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m31s)

and of the pixels and so this just draws


[01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,639](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m35s)

through putting white everywhere so show


[01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:45,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m39s)

all of these pixels but it also


[01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:48,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m40s)

effectively can clip off other elements


[01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:51,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m45s)

so I'm wondering if that's the thing is


[01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:54,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m48s)

border clip two bounds doesn't work the


[01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m51s)

way I expect


[01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:10,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m56s)

okay when in doubt Google with being WPF


[01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:10,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m03s)

border clip two bounds corner radius


[01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m10s)

I am not the first one to run into this


[01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:27,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m19s)

canvas does not clip its children so you


[01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:30,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m24s)

so you are correct it is so there there


[01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:33,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m27s)

is a canvas at play in here tied its


[01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:36,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m30s)

specifically inside of this ripple so we


[01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:39,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m33s)

have a border here and then the ripple


[01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:44,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m36s)

whose visual template gets applied which


[01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:46,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m39s)

is this guy up here so we technically


[01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:49,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m44s)

have a border inside of a grid and


[01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:52,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m46s)

inside of the grid we then have a canvas


[01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:55,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m49s)

and the ellipse is what's at is the


[01:30:52,250 --> 01:31:03,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m52s)

actual ripple effect that gets animated


[01:30:55,400 --> 01:31:09,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m55s)

in and out which is the effectively the


[01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:12,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m03s)

problem that we're dealing with so I


[01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:14,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m09s)

agree that a canvas wouldn't clip its


[01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:21,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m12s)

children but I thought I could clip a


[01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:32,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m14s)

canvas if that makes sense but maybe


[01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:35,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m21s)

maybe I am wrong on that this just not


[01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:38,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m32s)

look easy rounded corners for anything


[01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:44,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m35s)

this sounds more like what I want I want


[01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:48,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m38s)

rounded corners on my ripple let's see


[01:31:44,360 --> 01:32:01,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m44s)

what this stack overflow indicates oh


[01:31:48,880 --> 01:32:04,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m48s)

boy clipped abounds is for Oh got it


[01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:07,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m01s)

so that is my flaw so clip the bounds is


[01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:11,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m04s)

for layout which means I should probably


[01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:11,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m07s)

look up the docs on


[01:32:13,179 --> 01:32:18,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m13s)

so this is effectively the same problem


[01:32:19,059 --> 01:32:34,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m19s)

and so this one went down the opacity


[01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:39,289](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m23s)

mask approach dang it okay okay fine we


[01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:43,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m34s)

can go down that path the yuk yuk yuk


[01:32:39,289 --> 01:32:44,689](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m39s)

yuk okay well it's probably the better


[01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:49,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m43s)

solution because then I don't need to


[01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:52,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m44s)

deal with moving these properties around


[01:32:49,119 --> 01:33:03,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m49s)

okay let's go that route because that'll


[01:32:52,099 --> 01:33:04,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m52s)

that'll surely at least work and so


[01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:17,749](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m03s)

let's see here


[01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:20,269](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m04s)

a city mask so I don't think yeah I'm


[01:33:17,749 --> 01:33:23,079](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m17s)

pretty sure so we basically need this


[01:33:20,269 --> 01:33:23,079](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m20s)

guy here


[01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:38,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m31s)

let's actually jump back here real quick


[01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:43,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m33s)

how did he go about generating it hasty


[01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:52,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m38s)

mass visual and he took a visual brush


[01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:56,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m43s)

and passed in the element I don't like


[01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:58,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m52s)

doing that directly so the the problem


[01:33:56,190 --> 01:34:00,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m56s)

with putting an element directly into a


[01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:03,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m58s)

visual brush is it will work right up


[01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:07,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m00s)

until you have something like a moving


[01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:12,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m03s)

progress bar and then you'll start to


[01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:21,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m07s)

run into problems because I think what I


[01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:25,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m12s)

would rather do is just take the corner


[01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:32,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m21s)

radiuses and draw an appropriate


[01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:34,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m25s)

rectangle with them to clip by because I


[01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:38,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m32s)

don't necessarily want my pasty mass to


[01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:43,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m34s)

match that but the the problem being is


[01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:48,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m38s)

this mask like this guy here is going to


[01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:51,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m43s)

need to be a similar to this where we


[01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:56,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m48s)

end up needing to do a brush so either


[01:34:51,060 --> 01:35:01,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m51s)

need to pass it a visual brush or a


[01:34:56,640 --> 01:35:01,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m56s)

drawing brush and do the drawing myself


[01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:22,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m08s)

which one seems like less effort to me


[01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:25,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m13s)

because I think I think we just go with


[01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:28,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m22s)

multi binding and a converter do you get


[01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:32,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m25s)

the brush because again I don't


[01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:34,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m28s)

necessarily want to do a visual brush


[01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:37,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m32s)

and just do something like pointed at


[01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:39,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m34s)

content because really I'd end up


[01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:48,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m37s)

needing to actually point it at this


[01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:50,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m39s)

border does that work not well because


[01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m48s)

if I pointed at the border and say


[01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:56,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m50s)

somebody sets the background to


[01:35:51,990 --> 01:36:01,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m51s)

transparent then that fails I feel like


[01:35:56,310 --> 01:36:06,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m56s)

I want to control that Oh hold on hold


[01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:16,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m01s)

on here we go here we go we can cheat so


[01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:16,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m06s)

a pasty mask visual brush visual brush


[01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:31,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m20s)

what is it control visual and here let's


[01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:41,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m29s)

go ahead and black you off we just bring


[01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:48,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m31s)

in this guy and we put you in place


[01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:51,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m41s)

there we change the wax the name of that


[01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:56,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m48s)

because that's not what we want we grabs


[01:36:51,900 --> 01:37:00,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m51s)

that which will be fine we changed the


[01:36:56,610 --> 01:37:03,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m56s)

background to solid white because we


[01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:05,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m00s)

don't want too much we don't want


[01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:06,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m03s)

somebody just toggling the background


[01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:10,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m05s)

and causing their content to disappear


[01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:12,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m06s)

because of this mask we will let that go


[01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:17,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m10s)

through template binding the border


[01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:17,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m12s)

thickness is fine border effect


[01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m17s)

and I think that works


[01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:37,329](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m27s)

let's run it


[01:37:29,789 --> 01:37:40,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m29s)

I'm also tempted to go through and only


[01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:47,949](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m37s)

conditionally apply this mask if there


[01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:50,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m40s)

is a corner radius set so I think corner


[01:37:47,949 --> 01:37:54,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m47s)

radius has like an is empty property on


[01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:59,619](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m50s)

it I mean we could do it we could do it


[01:37:54,670 --> 01:38:02,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m54s)

is empty converter so I'm wondering if


[01:37:59,619 --> 01:38:06,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m59s)

it matters that we're just blindly


[01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:09,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m02s)

applying this in all cases top left top


[01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:14,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m06s)

right bottom oh there is one


[01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:18,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m09s)

it's just internal not helpful not


[01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:22,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m14s)

helpful at all but I believe this will


[01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:22,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m18s)

work and fix this corner radius problem


[01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:33,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m27s)

it is interesting I guess I never have


[01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:36,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m30s)

used clip to bounds outside of a


[01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:39,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m33s)

rectangle before because what you can do


[01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:42,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m36s)

in a lot of cases with your controls is


[01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:46,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m39s)

to kind of get like an overhang effect


[01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:48,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m42s)

you can do negative margins so you can


[01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:50,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m46s)

actually rather than wear a margin


[01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m48s)

pushes it in typically you can set a


[01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:56,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m50s)

negative one to let it go outside and


[01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:58,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m52s)

float and usually you end up setting


[01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:00,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m56s)

setting clip to bounds to false in most


[01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:04,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m58s)

cases to let something go outside


[01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:08,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m00s)

because a lot of controls or styles will


[01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:10,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m04s)

default to clipping which makes sense


[01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:13,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m08s)

because most of the time you don't


[01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:15,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m10s)

explore where you've set its size to be


[01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:19,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m13s)

a hundred by a hundred you don't expect


[01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:19,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m15s)

the children to exceed that size


[01:39:25,409 --> 01:39:45,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m25s)

oh that's not right that is really fun


[01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:52,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m38s)

though that's when a no pasty mass does


[01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:52,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m45s)

to you what did I do


[01:39:53,929 --> 01:40:09,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m53s)

so let's see this Oh pasty mask it's


[01:39:57,239 --> 01:40:14,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m57s)

getting applied boy that's exactly right


[01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:19,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m09s)

tight hole okay so the opacity mask gets


[01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:24,989](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m14s)

applied it picks up a visual these ones


[01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:27,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m19s)

shouldn't be making an if oh I bet you I


[01:40:24,989 --> 01:40:29,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m24s)

know what's happening so it's getting


[01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m27s)

the corner radius specified but this


[01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:35,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m29s)

visual inside of the visual brush isn't


[01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:37,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m32s)

actually part of the tree so it's not so


[01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:39,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m35s)

if we were to open this guy up in snoop


[01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:42,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m37s)

he would not show up as part of the


[01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:46,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m39s)

visual tree so what's happening and


[01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:48,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m42s)

again I think is the only reason we show


[01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:51,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m46s)

a size is because this corner radius so


[01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m48s)

the ones without a corner radius oh


[01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:55,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m51s)

there's still a little bit they're


[01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:59,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m53s)

almost shocked at that but I'm thinking


[01:40:55,860 --> 01:41:02,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m55s)

the issue is this guy size has


[01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:04,889](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m59s)

absolutely no he has no content or


[01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:09,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m02s)

relative parents to figure it out so he


[01:41:04,889 --> 01:41:17,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m04s)

just has to render which is problematic


[01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:20,639](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m09s)

so I think what we want to do is let's


[01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:21,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m17s)

do width and I don't know if I can get


[01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:28,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m20s)

away with this but we're going to try it


[01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:34,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m21s)

anyway element named boarder actual


[01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:34,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m28s)

width and same with height


[01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:49,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m38s)

find Dean I'm a name border actual


[01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m46s)

height so the subtle difference between


[01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:55,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m49s)

the width and height properties and the


[01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:57,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m51s)

actual width and actual height these


[01:41:55,390 --> 01:42:00,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m55s)

properties are the request of what size


[01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:02,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m57s)

it wants to go to and these are the ones


[01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:10,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m00s)

that actually got set after the control


[01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:15,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m02s)

was laid out and measured so hopefully


[01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:17,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m10s)

this now sizes our border because


[01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:20,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m15s)

ultimately I want the border inside of


[01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:26,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m17s)

this mask to exactly match the size and


[01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:26,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m20s)

position of this border that's the goal


[01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:37,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m27s)

I'm also realizing this guy has padding


[01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:38,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m31s)

applied to him and this guy doesn't


[01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:41,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m37s)

that's probably fine because the padding


[01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:45,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m38s)

would apply to the content then why not


[01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m41s)

just go so the risk that that I'm


[01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:51,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m45s)

worried about


[01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:53,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m46s)

by binding it directly to the the my


[01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:57,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m51s)

border or this border control up here


[01:42:53,320 --> 01:43:00,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m53s)

tied is in the event that somebody sets


[01:42:57,430 --> 01:43:04,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m57s)

the background color to transparent or


[01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:07,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m00s)

black right now if you do that and you


[01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:10,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m04s)

set the background color to black that


[01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:12,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m07s)

will it works you get a black button


[01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:14,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m10s)

with some content on it but if you were


[01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:17,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m12s)

to set the opacity mask does something


[01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:22,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m14s)

that's black that effectively


[01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:25,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m17s)

deletes the the those color bits which


[01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:27,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m22s)

white says turn all of the bits on black


[01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:28,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m25s)

says turn all of it off so if somebody


[01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:30,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m27s)

were to change this background color


[01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:33,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m28s)

they could cause their button to


[01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:34,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m30s)

disappear simply by changing this


[01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:37,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m33s)

background and that's the only thing


[01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:39,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m34s)

that's making making me a little weary


[01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:41,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m37s)

about it is that that seems very


[01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:43,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m39s)

counterintuitive specifically because


[01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:47,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m41s)

this border and the content of the


[01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m43s)

border are not directly related to each


[01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:52,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m47s)

other


[01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:55,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m48s)

this guy just happens to sit on top yeah


[01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:57,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m52s)

it's kind of a weird layout I mean I


[01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:01,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m55s)

understand why it's there it's because


[01:43:57,969 --> 01:44:13,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m57s)

we've got all these fancy buttons but


[01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:17,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m01s)

hey look at that no no no no oh but that


[01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:20,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m13s)

that what's that some what makes sense


[01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:26,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m17s)

because I've now done the exact same


[01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:29,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m20s)

thing wait a minute


[01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:32,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m26s)

I'm confused this border should have a


[01:44:29,409 --> 01:44:34,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m29s)

corner radius and the color should not


[01:44:32,590 --> 01:44:39,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m32s)

go outside of it


[01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:46,179](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m34s)

so what just happened okay back to the


[01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:50,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m39s)

snoop who system cannot find the file


[01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:54,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m46s)

specified there is something weird going


[01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:56,469](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m50s)

on here I did recently take a visual


[01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m54s)

studio update and I wonder if something


[01:44:56,469 --> 01:45:01,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m56s)

changed or maybe I need to update snoop


[01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:06,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m59s)

I don't remember the last version I


[01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:09,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m01s)

pulled it could be rather old I think


[01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:13,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m06s)

this is probably at least the right path


[01:45:09,159 --> 01:45:15,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m09s)

with this mask on here


[01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:18,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m13s)

it does make this a little more


[01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:18,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m15s)

difficult to debug


[01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:32,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m21s)

so where why if you have a corner radius


[01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:38,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m28s)

you should be rendering well okay so


[01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:43,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m32s)

still buggy right yeah okay dive me in


[01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:46,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m38s)

so on this ripple let's look at


[01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:49,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m43s)

so next snoop tip this window up here


[01:45:46,980 --> 01:46:00,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m46s)

lets you just search for stuff which is


[01:45:49,480 --> 01:46:03,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m49s)

awesome so that that is what get off


[01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:03,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m00s)

there


[01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:19,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m09s)

I mean that's what I would expect a


[01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:19,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m14s)

rounded corner with white


[01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:28,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m24s)

interesting what happens


[01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:47,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m35s)

they wanted to continue did not find


[01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:53,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m37s)

anything to edit because if that what


[01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:53,389](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m47s)

would do this what would do this to me


[01:47:01,989 --> 01:47:09,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m01s)

because the alternative is rather than


[01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:16,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m05s)

going with a border we go back with like


[01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:18,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m09s)

a a rectangle the only issue with just


[01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:20,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m16s)

doing a rectangle rather than a border


[01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:23,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m18s)

is then we have to also account for the


[01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:27,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m20s)

size of the border thickness in addition


[01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:28,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m23s)

to just the size of the border itself we


[01:47:27,070 --> 01:47:36,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m27s)

don't want to accidentally clip off


[01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:42,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m28s)

something though we're only looking to


[01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:45,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m36s)

clip the inner content I guess in that


[01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:47,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m42s)

case we really don't care I'm okay if I


[01:47:45,010 --> 01:47:49,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m45s)

clip the ripple as soon as it hits the


[01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:52,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m47s)

border pen or the border brush that's


[01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:54,520](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m49s)

going around the outside edge that way


[01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:58,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m52s)

it looks as though the edge is what


[01:47:54,520 --> 01:48:00,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m54s)

actually Clips it off which probably


[01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:03,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m58s)

makes sense because if you set a border


[01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:05,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m00s)

thickness with a border brush I think


[01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:10,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m03s)

having the ripple stopped when it hits


[01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:14,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m05s)

that border is probably expected or at


[01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:14,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m10s)

least it's not counterintuitive


[01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:34,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m24s)

did absolutely nothing which instantly


[01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:34,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m31s)

makes me skeptical


[01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:50,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m44s)

so when we bound this guy let's oh hang


[01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:54,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m47s)

on this screams of some sort of binding


[01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:58,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m50s)

failure a system data error object


[01:48:54,410 --> 01:49:03,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m54s)

source cannot converse null really


[01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:15,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m58s)

should deal with those no binding


[01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:22,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m03s)

failures on any of these why why would


[01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:23,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m15s)

that not pull through okay once again


[01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:25,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m22s)

back to the snoop


[01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:29,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m23s)

let's go and look at this guy again


[01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:29,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m25s)

because this should be


[01:49:35,179 --> 01:49:46,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m35s)

let's go back so this guy suggested


[01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:46,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m41s)

rounding match stretches to feel grid


[01:49:55,580 --> 01:50:03,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m55s)

background:white corner radius 7 and


[01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:03,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m59s)

uses that


[01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:32,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m12s)

then Eclipse so this is the stack panel


[01:50:18,099 --> 01:50:32,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m18s)

and any Content yeah


[01:50:36,390 --> 01:50:42,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m36s)

so effectively just loads this over the


[01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:42,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m39s)

top of his other grid


[01:50:51,679 --> 01:51:00,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m51s)

okay this feeling like I'm not getting


[01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:03,739](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m57s)

anything more useful out of that


[01:51:00,429 --> 01:51:10,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m00s)

okay so let's back this guy up go take a


[01:51:03,739 --> 01:51:14,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m03s)

look at his mask yeah rendering pretty


[01:51:10,429 --> 01:51:14,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m10s)

much exactly as it would expect


[01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:28,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m16s)

show me your width and heights


[01:51:21,469 --> 01:51:33,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m21s)

oh I'm inside the brush I need to look


[01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:39,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m28s)

at the brushes visual so look it here


[01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:44,929](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m33s)

actual height actual width that all got


[01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:55,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m39s)

rendered correctly did you pick up a


[01:51:44,929 --> 01:52:03,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m44s)

corner radius yeah so let's go down here


[01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:07,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m55s)

and change out well let's just play with


[01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:09,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m03s)

the width I guess just make sure this


[01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:11,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m07s)

guy is actually working the way I think


[01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:17,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m09s)

he's working okay


[01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:25,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m11s)

too much scrolling width so from 124 be


[01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:30,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m17s)

50 so now if I click I expect my ripple


[01:52:25,159 --> 01:52:32,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m25s)

to stop about halfway it's not stopping


[01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:37,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m30s)

at all


[01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:43,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m32s)

so this pasty mask applied directly to


[01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:43,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m37s)

the ripple it's not doing what I expect


[01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:57,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m48s)

and I bet you I know why so even though


[01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:59,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m53s)

we apply it to the ripple itself that


[01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:08,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m57s)

doesn't mean that it's actually used in


[01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:08,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m59s)

the controls template yep


[01:53:13,769 --> 01:53:22,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m13s)

so just because a property exists


[01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:24,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m16s)

doesn't mean it's actually used and in


[01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:30,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m22s)

our case we expect it to be applied to


[01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:35,039](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m24s)

the grid yep


[01:53:30,599 --> 01:53:39,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m30s)

what do you bet that I don't trust you


[01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:40,889](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m35s)

right now relaunch let's try this one


[01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:43,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m39s)

more time because I'm I'm willing to bet


[01:53:40,889 --> 01:53:47,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m40s)

that that was the the problem is even


[01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:53,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m43s)

though we set it on this control if it's


[01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:55,079](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m47s)

not used nothing recognises it the


[01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:58,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m53s)

template doesn't use it and the property


[01:53:55,079 --> 01:54:00,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m55s)

is effectively meaningless so we should


[01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:02,579](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m58s)

bring it forward this is a common


[01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:05,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m00s)

problem when we templating controls is


[01:54:02,579 --> 01:54:07,289](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m02s)

if you don't template bind all the


[01:54:05,429 --> 01:54:09,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m05s)

properties somebody may set one of the


[01:54:07,289 --> 01:54:14,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m07s)

properties and then get very confused


[01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:16,019](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m09s)

like myself as to why the setting the


[01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:18,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m14s)

property seems to have no effect then


[01:54:16,019 --> 01:54:20,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m16s)

the answer it gets dropped so I'm


[01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:24,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m18s)

willing to bet if we were to look down a


[01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:24,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m20s)

level we wouldn't see anything happening


[01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:32,039](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m26s)

this is also a reason why typically when


[01:54:29,519 --> 01:54:34,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m29s)

the easiest way to modify a control is


[01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:36,809](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m32s)

to set like the data templates that way


[01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:40,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m34s)

you're mucking with the content and not


[01:54:36,809 --> 01:54:42,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m36s)

to control itself but in our case with a


[01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:45,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m40s)

theme library it gets a little more


[01:54:42,769 --> 01:54:45,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m42s)

complex


[01:54:48,939 --> 01:54:52,739](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m48s)

let's see if this doesn't


[01:54:59,329 --> 01:55:04,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m59s)

as we could always wrap this wrap the


[01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:06,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m02s)

ripple in something to get the behavior


[01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:08,599](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m04s)

but no point in adding to the visual


[01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:10,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m06s)

tree if we don't have to especially


[01:55:08,599 --> 01:55:27,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m08s)

since we control the ripple we can fix


[01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:27,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m10s)

it okay so please work no no no no


[01:55:40,619 --> 01:55:43,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m40s)

if it's left


[01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:14,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m04s)

this unfortunately looks very similar I


[01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:20,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m12s)

really don't want to have to do some


[01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:23,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m14s)

sort of custom custom rendering and


[01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:26,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m20s)

measuring stuff that really doesn't feel


[01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:26,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m23s)

like what I want


[01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:45,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m38s)

that kind of what are you want no way


[01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:48,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m43s)

you have to put padding and margin


[01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m45s)

around it but Oh yuck


[01:56:50,960 --> 01:57:12,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m50s)

so canvas inside of a border same


[01:56:54,620 --> 01:57:19,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m54s)

technique and just left up one it does


[01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:23,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m12s)

not look like I am wondering if you're


[01:57:19,410 --> 01:57:28,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m19s)

right tight about the canvas being


[01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:34,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m23s)

problematic I just really really really


[01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:43,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m28s)

don't like these options just having to


[01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:45,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m34s)

effectively manually do your clip we


[01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:51,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m43s)

could do the clip directly rather than a


[01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:53,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m45s)

mask I wonder if that would be a cleaner


[01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:53,750](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m51s)

approach


[01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:08,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m05s)

let's try


[01:58:15,110 --> 01:58:20,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m15s)

let's give this a try so


[01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:29,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m25s)

oh let's put this back to white real


[01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m27s)

quick before I get too carried away


[01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:41,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m29s)

let's just try this one more time


[01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:46,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m31s)

because I do expect this to work does


[01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:49,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m41s)

beg the question this is white and the


[01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:53,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m46s)

background is transferred or the outer


[01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:59,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m49s)

areas transparent if that doesn't


[01:58:53,610 --> 01:59:02,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m53s)

effectively clip I got one more thought


[01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:09,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m59s)

on this visual if this doesn't work I


[01:59:02,430 --> 01:59:12,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m02s)

may put this inside of a grid because


[01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:15,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m09s)

I'm wondering so this border when it


[01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:20,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m12s)

draws effectively draws a rounded


[01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:21,690](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m15s)

cornered border but then the question is


[01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:24,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m20s)

if you look at the rectangle of that


[01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:26,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m21s)

border what's outside of the white and


[01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:28,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m24s)

the answer is it's unset so it


[01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:33,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m26s)

effectively draws transparent and I'm


[01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:40,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m28s)

wondering if it draws effectively the


[01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:44,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m33s)

hex value zero zero ffffff because if


[01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:47,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m40s)

that's the case and the opacity mask


[01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:49,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m44s)

doesn't take alpha into consideration


[01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:52,050](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m47s)

which it would given that we're trying


[01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:54,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m49s)

to do opacity it would not shock me that


[01:59:52,050 --> 02:00:01,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m52s)

it would remove those and just do the


[01:59:54,980 --> 02:00:03,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m54s)

bitwise and across the board then that


[02:00:01,170 --> 02:00:07,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m01s)

would block it out so my thought is


[02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:09,810](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m03s)

effectively to put this border inside of


[02:00:07,190 --> 02:00:13,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m07s)

another border and have its background


[02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:15,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m09s)

be black that way we have black around


[02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:20,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m13s)

the outside of a white and use that


[02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:23,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m15s)

effectively to clip it so if this fails


[02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:26,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m20s)

we might try that first before we go


[02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:28,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m23s)

carried away too much on the clip so


[02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:28,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m26s)

yeah that doesn't play nice with the


[02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:35,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m28s)

other children


[02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:35,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m28s)

so border background


[02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:47,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m36s)

black I wonder if that's what's causing


[02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:47,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m39s)

the problem to do and you go there I


[02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:59,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m47s)

trust you I trust you


[02:00:50,100 --> 02:01:02,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m50s)

nope still gonna relaunch you because


[02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:02,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m59s)

this puts you over the top


[02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:24,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m12s)

because this should limit the size to


[02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:26,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m16s)

exactly match this one yeah and we saw


[02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:29,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m24s)

that the bindings on all of these went


[02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:31,620](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m26s)

through and worked because when we


[02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:34,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m29s)

examined this border we saw that the


[02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:35,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m31s)

width and height of it were set


[02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:40,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m34s)

appropriately and the corner radius was


[02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:43,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m35s)

set appropriately so everything is


[02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:45,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m40s)

flowing correctly it is just not


[02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:52,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m43s)

properly clipping that ripple like I


[02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:56,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m45s)

would expect and we did modify this so


[02:01:52,590 --> 02:02:07,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m52s)

that the Oh pasty mass does convert all


[02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:09,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m56s)

the way down I'm wondering as we want it


[02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:11,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m07s)

to ultimately get applied to this canvas


[02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:14,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m09s)

so I think applying it to this grid is


[02:02:11,790 --> 02:02:14,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m11s)

correct


[02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:28,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m14s)

I am wondering ripple assist click to


[02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:28,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m21s)

bounce oh oh don't tell me


[02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:40,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m32s)

don't tell me that would be propagating


[02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:49,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m35s)

all the way down my double check that


[02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:59,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m40s)

just to make darn sure I forgot about


[02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:59,120](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m49s)

that property let's just come up here


[02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:13,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m01s)

bowl assists clip the bounds true turn


[02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:13,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m10s)

that on


[02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:27,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m16s)

okay Snoop come save me I am lost and


[02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:27,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m22s)

confused Wow


[02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:33,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m28s)

this keeps happening I might have to dig


[02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:36,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m31s)

into why Snoop is ultimately failing


[02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:36,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m33s)

because this seems off


[02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:51,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m42s)

so what do we got going on so on our


[02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:54,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m44s)

pasty mask have a border its inner


[02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:56,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m51s)

border or I should say the outer border


[02:03:54,200 --> 02:04:01,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m54s)

is black so we've got a black rectangle


[02:03:56,770 --> 02:04:04,220](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m56s)

its inner border is white its size to


[02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:05,990](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m01s)

match the background border of our


[02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:08,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m04s)

buttons so its width and height will


[02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:11,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m05s)

match and it's corner radius will match


[02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:13,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m08s)

great same with the border thickness and


[02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:16,490](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m11s)

border brush but both of these are unset


[02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:19,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m13s)

right now same with our effect we aren't


[02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:22,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m16s)

setting a shadow depth or at least we're


[02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:24,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m19s)

not setting one beyond the default which


[02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:31,100](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m22s)

is fine I guess we're technically Shetty


[02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:33,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m24s)

setting a shadow depth of one this


[02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:36,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m31s)

should cause us to have effectively a


[02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:40,310](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m33s)

black rectangle with a white rectangle


[02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:44,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m36s)

inside of it with rounded corners which


[02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:53,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m40s)

should be clipping the content this


[02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:53,380](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m44s)

custom ripple control takes it in and


[02:04:55,690 --> 02:05:04,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m55s)

applies it at the parent grid the parent


[02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:16,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m01s)

grid contains both the canvas and the


[02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:18,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m04s)

content the canvas sits below usually


[02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:21,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m16s)

except for there I know there's a style


[02:05:18,470 --> 02:05:24,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m18s)

trigger that changes its Z index so


[02:05:21,110 --> 02:05:27,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m21s)

either sits at 0 below the content


[02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:30,350](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m24s)

presenter or sits at 2 to be on top of


[02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:34,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m27s)

the content presenter because we needed


[02:05:30,350 --> 02:05:36,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m30s)

that for some of the honestly for the


[02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:38,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m34s)

demo app for the controls that we were


[02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:45,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m36s)

using because the ripple was being


[02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:51,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m38s)

applied directly so let's take a look


[02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:51,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m45s)

here where do you go


[02:05:52,610 --> 02:06:08,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m52s)

still no dice still no dice what is


[02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:08,440](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m57s)

going on so


[02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:46,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m31s)

interesting okay so this guy here he's


[02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:46,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m42s)

not being clipped at all


[02:06:49,290 --> 02:07:01,719](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m49s)

why so this sets the property on the


[02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:04,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m58s)

clip two bounds here based upon that but


[02:07:01,719 --> 02:07:14,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m01s)

we're just gonna go a step a step lower


[02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:23,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m04s)

and just hard coded here that doesn't


[02:07:14,110 --> 02:07:28,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m14s)

end up causing all right layout not okay


[02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:31,239](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m23s)

so let's go back and I think I'm gonna


[02:07:28,210 --> 02:07:38,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m28s)

leave this fuchsia because that's a


[02:07:31,239 --> 02:07:42,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m31s)

whole lot that's a quicker test mmm good


[02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:43,929](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m38s)

to know tied there's something I have to


[02:07:42,429 --> 02:07:45,790](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m42s)

believe there's something weird either


[02:07:43,929 --> 02:07:48,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m43s)

like what you'd mentioned earlier with


[02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:53,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m45s)

the canvas not properly clipping its


[02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:55,719](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m48s)

children or something with this control


[02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:57,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m53s)

template where some of the default


[02:07:55,719 --> 02:07:59,469](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m55s)

properties don't move all the way down I


[02:07:57,370 --> 02:08:01,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m57s)

did go through and add these template


[02:07:59,469 --> 02:08:05,679](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m59s)

bindings I think I'm gonna attempt this


[02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:09,699](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m01s)

clip I I think that's where we're gonna


[02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:16,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m05s)

go next and see what's going on because


[02:08:09,699 --> 02:08:18,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m09s)

I don't think this so here's here's a


[02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:20,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m16s)

quick here's a quick test just to just


[02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:23,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m18s)

to test this guy out


[02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:35,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m20s)

so rather than setting the ripple


[02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:39,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m23s)

content presents re content control yeah


[02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:39,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m35s)

and let's take a look at this


[02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:55,340](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m46s)

so this will remove the ripple but this


[02:08:50,989 --> 02:08:57,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m50s)

will at least let us test if the if the


[02:08:55,340 --> 02:09:01,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m55s)

issue with the opacity mask is with the


[02:08:57,650 --> 02:09:05,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m57s)

mass that we've created or with the or


[02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:06,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m01s)

if it's something with the ripple this


[02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:12,469](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m05s)

should at least narrow down where to


[02:09:06,409 --> 02:09:15,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m06s)

start the hunt and I'm technically 10


[02:09:12,469 --> 02:09:18,139](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m12s)

minutes past when I normally stop but


[02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:21,949](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m15s)

this is effectively nerd sniped me and


[02:09:18,139 --> 02:09:28,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m18s)

now I must know the answer and it's


[02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:30,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m21s)

going to bother me in my sleep this is


[02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:34,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m28s)

the problem with good programming


[02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:43,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m30s)

puzzles because I can't rest until I can


[02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:45,739](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m34s)

actually explain it oh that doesn't


[02:09:43,369 --> 02:09:50,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m43s)

remind me a couple streams back I showed


[02:09:45,739 --> 02:09:52,699](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m45s)

a programming puzzle it was on one of


[02:09:50,210 --> 02:09:56,659](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m50s)

these system command line streams where


[02:09:52,699 --> 02:09:58,639](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m52s)

I showed off a simple puzzle of given a


[02:09:56,659 --> 02:10:02,119](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m56s)

system type create an empty delegate for


[02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:03,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m58s)

it and somebody had pointed out that my


[02:10:02,119 --> 02:10:06,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m02s)

solution appeared to have an air in it


[02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:08,239](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m03s)

which I agreed that it looked like it


[02:10:06,769 --> 02:10:11,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m06s)

was an error and then when I started to


[02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:12,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m08s)

dig into it more I found a unit test


[02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:16,789](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m11s)

that actually covered the case in


[02:10:12,769 --> 02:10:20,409](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m12s)

question and ultimately I ended up


[02:10:16,789 --> 02:10:26,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m16s)

realizing that my code works due to a an


[02:10:20,409 --> 02:10:28,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m20s)

a an accidental issue in the runtime so


[02:10:26,420 --> 02:10:33,769](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m26s)

in the runtime null is defined to be the


[02:10:28,849 --> 02:10:40,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m28s)

bit pattern of all zeros and so that


[02:10:33,769 --> 02:10:40,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m33s)

ultimately Oh interesting so that okay


[02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:55,890](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m44s)

so that worked did that work


[02:10:49,800 --> 02:11:05,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m49s)

I don't know if I can say that that


[02:10:55,890 --> 02:11:08,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m55s)

worked here's what we can do we can turn


[02:11:05,730 --> 02:11:08,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m05s)

off this corner radius


[02:11:18,959 --> 02:11:24,659](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m18s)

yes we turn off that corner radius try


[02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:30,559](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m23s)

it one more time


[02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:32,909](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m24s)

so in the run time null is I agree tied


[02:11:30,559 --> 02:11:35,579](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m30s)

in the run time Knoll is defined to be


[02:11:32,909 --> 02:11:38,429](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m32s)

the bit pattern of all zeros and so in


[02:11:35,579 --> 02:11:42,900](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m35s)

the the brain teaser puzzle that I put


[02:11:38,429 --> 02:11:46,260](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m38s)

out to return null from a reference type


[02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:47,969](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m42s)

I was just emitting a 0 and it was


[02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:51,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m46s)

working and I didn't fully understand


[02:11:47,969 --> 02:11:53,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m47s)

why omitting a 0 return null but it


[02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:56,219](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m51s)

turns out when you're working at the IL


[02:11:53,369 --> 02:12:00,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m53s)

level if you have a reference type and


[02:11:56,219 --> 02:12:03,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m56s)

you emit a zero it is the runtime treats


[02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:05,519](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m00s)

null as all zeros so it works I did not


[02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:10,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m03s)

know that when I wrote the code but it


[02:12:05,519 --> 02:12:12,439](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m05s)

was a nice accident to stumble into so


[02:12:10,199 --> 02:12:15,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m10s)

rather than fixing any problems I just


[02:12:12,439 --> 02:12:18,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m12s)

documented the code for anyone else who


[02:12:15,150 --> 02:12:18,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m15s)

wanted to come across it


[02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:28,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m23s)

yeah and if we don't solve this tonight


[02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:29,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m26s)

I'm probably gonna end up waking up in


[02:12:28,290 --> 02:12:32,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m28s)

the morning with a solution or worse


[02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:33,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m29s)

waking up at about 3 or 4 a.m. with the


[02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:37,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m32s)

answer and having to get out of bed and


[02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:42,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m33s)

go to my computer and type it out that's


[02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:45,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m37s)

usually how it goes much to the dismay


[02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:48,630](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m42s)

of my wife she doesn't understand how I


[02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:58,650](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m45s)

can fall asleep and then find a solution


[02:12:48,630 --> 02:13:00,870](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m48s)

to a problem and I've learned my lesson


[02:12:58,650 --> 02:13:02,130](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m58s)

if I don't if I wake up with the answer


[02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:06,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m00s)

I need to go write it down immediately


[02:13:02,130 --> 02:13:08,550](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m02s)

otherwise by the time I wake up in the


[02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:16,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m06s)

morning the answers gone there's there's


[02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:19,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m08s)

nothing left glad to know I'm not alone


[02:13:16,710 --> 02:13:25,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m16s)

okay


[02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:29,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m19s)

that makes me feel slightly better and a


[02:13:25,170 --> 02:13:33,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m25s)

little bit worse so I still have


[02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:42,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m29s)

magnifier opens what is it no windows


[02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:45,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m33s)

plus so because we're applying a no


[02:13:42,510 --> 02:13:48,560](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m42s)

pasty mass to this guy and we would have


[02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:53,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m45s)

expected the corner radius to trim it


[02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:58,230](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m48s)

the issue is with our mask not with the


[02:13:53,880 --> 02:14:02,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m53s)

ripple because I would have expected to


[02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:10,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m58s)

see a corner trimmed right here with the


[02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:10,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m02s)

2550 radius and it's not


[02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:26,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m12s)

so that that makes me feel mildly better


[02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:28,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m18s)

knowing that it is a meant ID that makes


[02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:30,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m26s)

me feel mildly better knowing that it's


[02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:35,940](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m28s)

not something broken in the ripple and


[02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:44,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m30s)

it is just broken with my usage of this


[02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:47,430](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m35s)

Oh pasty mask and the visual brush so


[02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:51,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m44s)

that bothers me a great deal that this


[02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:51,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m47s)

is not working the way I expect


[02:14:56,700 --> 02:15:07,800](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m56s)

so let's do let's do this it's not a


[02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:13,110](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m05s)

it's not a great test but let's move


[02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:19,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m07s)

this content out of here and slap you


[02:15:13,110 --> 02:15:23,670](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m13s)

directly in all right let's just make


[02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:25,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m19s)

darn sure that this is actually yeah I


[02:15:23,670 --> 02:15:28,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m23s)

don't quite trust you


[02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:33,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m25s)

let's relaunch let's just make sure that


[02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:39,360](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m28s)

this actually works the way that I


[02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:44,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m33s)

expect so now inside of every button I


[02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:52,280](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m39s)

expect to see this black and white


[02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:54,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m44s)

layout so no corner radius anywhere


[02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:57,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m52s)

except this white rectangle on the


[02:15:54,510 --> 02:16:05,700](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m54s)

inside with a black one around the


[02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:12,570](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m57s)

outside why do you not properly trim


[02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:16,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m05s)

yourself what would make this mask not


[02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:18,150](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m12s)

work because we know this technique is


[02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:22,080](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m16s)

exactly what we've done before except


[02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:30,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m18s)

for we use the dry and brush here with a


[02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:32,580](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m22s)

very particular size and in this case


[02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:35,881](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m30s)

it's drawing a straight rectangle rather


[02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:38,910](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m32s)

than doing these sort of fancy curvature


[02:16:35,881 --> 02:16:42,270](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m35s)

corner rectangles only because this


[02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:46,051](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m38s)

rectangle is being drawn to account for


[02:16:42,270 --> 02:16:48,510](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m42s)

where that shadow would appear but it's


[02:16:46,051 --> 02:16:49,950](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m46s)

being drawn to clip the shadow off of


[02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:53,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m48s)

particular edges because normally if you


[02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:57,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m49s)

just do the drop shadow effect on things


[02:16:53,970 --> 02:17:00,660](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m53s)

it comes off on potentially two sides


[02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:04,131](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m57s)

ish one side ish depending on the angle


[02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:06,420](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m00s)

that you set and that's not always


[02:17:04,131 --> 02:17:08,010](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m04s)

desirable especially with like a color


[02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:09,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m06s)

zone where you may just want the shadow


[02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:20,770](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m08s)

along one edge


[02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:23,139](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m09s)

so this lets you clip it yeah agreed


[02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:24,849](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m20s)

that that element name I would have


[02:17:23,139 --> 02:17:33,099](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m23s)

expected to be effectively the same


[02:17:24,849 --> 02:17:38,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m24s)

thing okay so this so this is what's


[02:17:33,099 --> 02:17:43,840](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m33s)

baffling to me is this is exactly what I


[02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:49,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m38s)

would expect I would expect black


[02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:57,250](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m43s)

rectangle white around the edge which


[02:17:49,450 --> 02:18:01,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m49s)

should clip what the heck what the heck


[02:17:57,250 --> 02:18:01,170](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m57s)

is going on here


[02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:19,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m10s)

okay so something is not going the way I


[02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:19,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m16s)

expect


[02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:32,820](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m26s)

so let's let's change this up then let's


[02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:35,610](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m29s)

let's make this stupid simple so rather


[02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:38,190](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m32s)

than actually taking in content the


[02:18:35,610 --> 02:18:48,480](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m35s)

content of all buttons shall simply be


[02:18:38,190 --> 02:18:52,200](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m38s)

the border of blue right and so this


[02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:54,720](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m48s)

thing effectively because we know it


[02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:57,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m52s)

renders correctly you know it draws


[02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:57,500](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m54s)

correctly


[02:19:03,709 --> 02:19:08,019](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m03s)

what am I doing wrong


[02:19:13,479 --> 02:19:21,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m13s)

this should bring in so I would expect


[02:19:19,099 --> 02:19:24,619](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m19s)

to get the the blue rectangle now


[02:19:21,369 --> 02:19:31,369](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m21s)

effectively with this applying the


[02:19:24,619 --> 02:19:39,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m24s)

rounded corners to it I'm missing


[02:19:31,369 --> 02:19:41,359](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m31s)

something stupid on visual brush its


[02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:48,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m39s)

value this specifies whether this visual


[02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:48,159](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m41s)

brush will run loud and and it's visual


[02:19:51,520 --> 02:20:03,229](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m51s)

I said defaulting to false because the


[02:19:59,419 --> 02:20:08,090](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m59s)

part that bothers me is if this was


[02:20:03,229 --> 02:20:11,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m03s)

really failing to lay out these borders


[02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:13,939](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m08s)

inside of it I would have sort of


[02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:21,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m11s)

expected that to result in no content


[02:20:13,939 --> 02:20:27,619](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m13s)

being displayed not all content and it's


[02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:30,819](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m21s)

clearly showing all content okay let's


[02:20:27,619 --> 02:20:30,819](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m27s)

take a look at this guy


[02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:46,400](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m38s)

quite literally nothing being applied it


[02:20:44,510 --> 02:20:48,740](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m44s)

is worth noting that there is some


[02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:49,479](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m46s)

amount of padding that's clearly being


[02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:51,530](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m48s)

set here


[02:20:49,479 --> 02:20:59,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m49s)

I'm guessing this thing must have a


[02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:59,020](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m51s)

default padding of something 16 4 16 4


[02:20:59,350 --> 02:21:05,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m59s)

that doesn't visually line up with what


[02:21:02,810 --> 02:21:08,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m02s)

I expect but I'm not horribly concerned


[02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:08,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m05s)

with tracking that down at the moment


[02:21:08,890 --> 02:21:14,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m08s)

because for all I know that's being


[02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:14,290](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m10s)

overridden in a drive style


[02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:31,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m23s)

interesting interesting interesting well


[02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:33,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m29s)

unfortunately if we don't solve this


[02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:36,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m31s)

here in the next few minutes I may just


[02:21:33,850 --> 02:21:40,210](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m33s)

have to go to bed and have a pen and


[02:21:36,370 --> 02:21:42,760](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m36s)

paper but if somebody wants to solve it


[02:21:40,210 --> 02:21:48,070](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m40s)

for me I would not be opposed to a good


[02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:49,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m42s)

pole request because I'm starting to


[02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:52,710](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m48s)

wonder if the problem is that just that


[02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:55,540](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m49s)

I am too tired and can't think straight


[02:21:52,710 --> 02:22:04,000](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m52s)

which is a very real possibility right


[02:21:55,540 --> 02:22:05,320](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m55s)

now so let's see mask oh wait a minute


[02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m04s)

nevermind that shouldn't be applied


[02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:16,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m05s)

there I'm at the wrong level see I'm at


[02:22:09,370 --> 02:22:16,470](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m09s)

the wrong so the mask


[02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:26,199](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m23s)

clip


[02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:38,600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m32s)

I think you tied yeah I'm I'm about at


[02:22:35,930 --> 02:22:40,370](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m35s)

my wit's end on this one but I'm it's


[02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:46,390](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m38s)

going to bother me especially since this


[02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:48,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m40s)

is the last issue remaining so I I


[02:22:46,390 --> 02:22:51,860](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m46s)

really want to get this fixed before we


[02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:55,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m48s)

kick to 600 out the door so I think with


[02:22:51,860 --> 02:22:57,680](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m51s)

that I might have to sign off for now I


[02:22:55,040 --> 02:23:01,160](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m55s)

am planning on streaming again at this


[02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:03,880](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m57s)

time next week so if this works for you


[02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:07,521](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m01s)

if it's not too late I'll probably be on


[02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:10,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m03s)

again then there's also a chance I may


[02:23:07,521 --> 02:23:12,920](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m07s)

do another impromptu stream either later


[02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:14,980](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m10s)

this week maybe next week there's a


[02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:17,780](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m12s)

system command line issue that's


[02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:21,140](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m14s)

plaguing me that I want to actually get


[02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:23,060](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m17s)

resolved so if people are interested in


[02:23:21,140 --> 02:23:26,330](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m21s)

the system command line library and


[02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:27,830](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m23s)

working on a bug there I will probably


[02:23:26,330 --> 02:23:30,640](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m26s)

be attacking that and figured I would


[02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:33,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m27s)

live streaming it's going to be a lot of


[02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:35,960](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m30s)

creating synchronous overloads for async


[02:23:33,410 --> 02:23:38,300](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m33s)

methods and how to not shoot yourself in


[02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:40,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m35s)

the foot while doing it so it's not


[02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:44,180](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m38s)

exactly a trivial thing and normally you


[02:23:40,970 --> 02:23:48,590](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m40s)

shouldn't ever do it but in our case


[02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:50,240](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m44s)

it's kind of required so with that I


[02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:52,850](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m48s)

will say good night thanks for hanging


[02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:55,460](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m50s)

out tight as always it's been a it's


[02:23:52,850 --> 02:23:58,970](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m52s)

been fun and glad that we made progress


[02:23:55,460 --> 02:24:00,410](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m55s)

and hopefully it's one last item I


[02:23:58,970 --> 02:24:01,730](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m58s)

thought it was going to be simple I


[02:24:00,410 --> 02:24:05,030](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m00s)

thought we were going to knock it all


[02:24:01,730 --> 02:24:07,040](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m01s)

off tonight but apparently we will we'll


[02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:10,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m05s)

do it again later so with that I will


[02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:10,450](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m07s)

say good night and happy coding


[02:24:16,279 --> 02:24:18,339](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m16s)

you
