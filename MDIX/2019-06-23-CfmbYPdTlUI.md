[okay sorry about that yeah sorry about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m13s)



[that tied my mic was off so I'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m16s)



[back and start over and then I'm going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m19s)



[to edit this stream so that I don't look](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m21s)



[like a complete fool so what I was going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m23s)



[through is tonight I'm gonna try to bust](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m27s)



[through as much of the to 600 release as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m29s)



[we can and see how far we can actually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m31s)



[get I optimistically there's not that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m34s)



[much here so I think we can probably get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m37s)



[through most of these items so if people](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m39s)



[have questions or there's example isn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m43s)



[what not you want to see I have no](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m44s)



[problem deviating otherwise my go-to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m46s)



[setting is I'm just gonna keep working](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m49s)



[through this and see how much of this we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m51s)



[can get knocked out I think I'm actually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m53s)



[going to ignore the bug for now and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h00m56s)



[start at the bottom and work up because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m00s)



[the easier ones are at the bottom and I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m03s)



[was going to boost my confidence before](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m06s)



[getting too carried away so this first](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m08s)



[one down here we'll get this guy fired](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m11s)



[up so pull requests to 8 3 so I've left](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m13s)



[this one open for quite a while for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m19s)



[those people who are interested the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m22s)



[basic premise of this one is I'm Sergey](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m25s)



[and I will not try the last name because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m29s)



[I'll try to avoid making a fool of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m33s)



[myself was needing the actual brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m34s)



[colors specified as resources for the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m37s)



[purposes of actually being able to build](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m40s)



[out alternate themes so if you were](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m43s)



[going to say wreath theme](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m45s)



[some other control library like I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m48s)



[he was using the exceed controls it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m50s)



[very hard to Rieti meeee if all you have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m55s)



[is the brushes defined in the resources](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h01m57s)



[and not the actual colors themselves so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m01s)



[if you need to say redefine a brush with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m03s)



[a color you can still do it but you have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m06s)



[to go through some extra steps and it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m08s)



[would be easier if this was defined in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m10s)



[here now thankfully I so I don't think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m11s)



[we're gonna take this pull request as is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m15s)



[because this is working on the old](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m16s)



[theming library stuff and I am very much](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m18s)



[looking towards the new theming library](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m22s)



[code so but I left this in here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m24s)



[as a note to myself to not forget that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m27s)



[we wanted to include this feature as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m29s)



[part of the new theming code that's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m31s)



[actually going out with too sick so so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m34s)



[backing up so the the the guts of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m37s)



[new theming code for anybody who hasn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m41s)



[played with it really kind of boils down](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m44s)



[to this set theme call on resource](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m46s)



[dictionary extensions it acts on a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m50s)



[resource dictionary and takes in one of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m53s)



[these I themed objects so let's look at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m54s)



[these real quick so the eye themed](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m57s)



[objects are really just a lists of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h02m59s)



[colors that's all they are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m01s)



[ideally this solves a lot of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m04s)



[problems that we fought with in the past](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m06s)



[where people want to declare their own](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m08s)



[custom color themes and it's really](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m09s)



[difficult to go through and get and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m11s)



[specify your own themes especially if](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m15s)



[you want to toggle between the built-in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m18s)



[themes your own custom theme and that so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m19s)



[now we're ski scenario you can just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m22s)



[implement an a theme but there's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m25s)



[actually some clever tricks to hopefully](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m27s)



[cover all of the common cases so real](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m31s)



[quick let's just take a look at this so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m33s)



[in the demo app in the App damo there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m36s)



[are we I tried to leave in comments](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m41s)



[showing off the different ways of doing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m44s)



[the theming so one is you can go and do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m46s)



[the same way that we've done in the last](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m49s)



[I forget probably since the beginning](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m51s)



[number of versions at least in all the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m53s)



[2x versions you can just declare the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m56s)



[resource dictionaries where you declare](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h03m58s)



[light or dark theme you declare a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m00s)



[primary color and then you declare an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m03s)



[accent color and that defines all your](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m04s)



[color brushes great fine this works](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m06s)



[great but if you're like me you can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m09s)



[never remember exactly what these are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m12s)



[and so you end up going back and copying](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m14s)



[and pasting from another app or the demo](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m16s)



[app just to try to remember these things](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m17s)



[and toggle out just these colors which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m20s)



[has always been a little obnoxious to me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m23s)



[so in the to 601 there is now new markup](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m25s)



[extensions that just return new resource](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m29s)



[dictionaries so for example rather than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m32s)



[doing this bit of work here where you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m36s)



[declare light deep purple and lime as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m38s)



[your accent color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m39s)



[you can do something like this where you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m41s)



[declare the base theme either light or](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m45s)



[dark and because these are enums you get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m48s)



[nice intellisense inherit is not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m52s)



[currently implemented so if you specify](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m55s)



[inherit at the root level it won't do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m57s)



[anything](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h04m59s)



[you'll get neither the light nor the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m01s)



[dark theme brushes which isn't quite](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m03s)



[right at some point I want to go through](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m04s)



[and have this when the users on a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m07s)



[Windows 8 or 10 machine actually pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m09s)



[the system to find state whether it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m12s)



[light or dark theme but that is not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m15s)



[implemented yet at the root level so for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m18s)



[now pick light or dark but then you've](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m20s)



[also got enums for your primary and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m22s)



[accent color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m23s)



[so rather than these three lines which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m24s)



[are somewhat difficult to remember the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m26s)



[URIs for you can just specify a couple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m27s)



[enums and you're done right and then for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m30s)



[those people who want more control than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m33s)



[just the built in theme colors you've](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m35s)



[also got the custom color theme which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m38s)



[the base theme is still the same light](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m42s)



[or dark but then you can specify any](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m44s)



[sort of RGB color that you want so you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m46s)



[know if you want to just go through and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m51s)



[specify something like that to get lime](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m54s)



[or whatever other color you want great](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m55s)



[you can then build these out and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h05m58s)



[based upon whatever color you pick here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m02s)



[it kind of picks arbitrary light and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m04s)



[dark hues so this is effectively the mid](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m07s)



[hue for the color and it'll do some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m09s)



[color magic for on the HSV color space](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m13s)



[and convert to light and dark versions](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m16s)



[of it so those are the new color themes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m18s)



[but ultimately if we walk through how](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m22s)



[all of these things work what they end](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m24s)



[up doing is really just calling set](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m28s)



[theme on a resource dictionary which is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m30s)



[all these markup extensions do is they](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m32s)



[they build up one of these theme objects](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m34s)



[call this set theme method and it walks](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m36s)



[through this set solid color brush and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m39s)



[make sure that all of our brushes are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m41s)



[defined it is worth noting there are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m43s)



[technically this secondary accent brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m46s)



[and secondary accent foreground brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m49s)



[these should be considered](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m51s)



[deprecated and obsolete so if you're](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m54s)



[using these directly in your code](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m56s)



[please migrate away the appropriate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h06m58s)



[changes is going to be the secondary](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m00s)



[brushes so specifically secondary hue](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m02s)



[mid brush and foreground brush are the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m06s)



[direct replacements but now we also have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m08s)



[light and dark hues for your accent](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m11s)



[color as well so the library right now](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m14s)



[is only using the mid stuff but these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m16s)



[other light and dark versions are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m19s)



[available okay so all of that said what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m21s)



[this issue was actually looking for is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m25s)



[to take these colors that are being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m27s)



[passed in and actually stored them as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m29s)



[resources as well so I'm going to jump](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m31s)



[over here and like a good programmer](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m35s)



[create a branch let's see and because I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m39s)



[can't remember my fix 683 great so we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m47s)



[will create a branch that way we can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m52s)



[pull request it back in when we're done](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m56s)



[and away we go and I think this is going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m57s)



[to be a very simple simple bit of code](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h07m59s)



[to write because in here we're already](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m04s)



[passing in the color value as well as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m06s)



[the name so I think that the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m08s)



[simplest thing to do is down here before](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m11s)



[we get too far carried away is just as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m14s)



[simple as source dictionary and spelling](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m17s)



[counts you must spell at least](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m23s)



[consistently in our industry I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m26s)



[it's going to be as simple as that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m33s)



[one-liner which is much simpler than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m35s)



[what it was in the old API so again I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m37s)



[less interested in taking the the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m41s)



[pull request as is but I do want to make](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m45s)



[sure we get that same equivalent feature](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m48s)



[so if other people want to go through](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m49s)



[and theme this stuff out they can and I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m51s)



[believe that just works it is important](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m56s)



[to note that if you are using the old](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h08m58s)



[style of setting your resource](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m01s)



[dictionaries like this you are not going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m03s)



[to pick up this feature and I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m05s)



[not real concerned with that I suspect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m07s)



[most people will migrate off if this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m10s)



[the feature that they're looking for so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m12s)



[again](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m15s)



[I'm gonna call this good enough Sergei](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m16s)



[if you happen to be watching this at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m19s)



[some point and this doesn't meet your](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m21s)



[needs please shoot me a message and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m22s)



[reopen and I would love to discuss](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m23s)



[further but I'm hoping that being able](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m26s)



[to do this should solve it so that is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m28s)



[not where we are going there we go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m34s)



[so let's see add color resources in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m36s)



[addition to brushes I promise I can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m44s)



[spell I'm just not good at it when](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m51s)



[people are watching I believe there's an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h09m52s)

[so simple change commit and we will push](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m10s)



[this guy up and then sure then we will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m17s)



[just pull request that in and get that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m23s)



[done so pull requests and we'll make](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m25s)



[sure the CI stuff passes which I don't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m33s)



[believe there's anything so hang on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m37s)



[where'd it go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m43s)



[claimed it was pushed fix origin six six](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m45s)



[eight three there is my button github](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m51s)



[was just a little slow](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m55s)



[let's see we will put this in the to 600](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h10m58s)



[milestone create pull request and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m01s)



[we are just going to mark the other one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m05s)



[is superseded and close it let's see](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m07s)



[here so here and seated by comment and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m13s)



[one more down and then as soon as this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m36s)



[guy goes green which shouldn't take it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m40s)



[but a moment we'll merge it in and that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m42s)



[will be one less thing done okay back to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m45s)



[my milestone list and let's just keep](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m48s)



[going on our way up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m49s)



[so this added stack bar message ignored](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m50s)



[duplicate this is something I've bumped](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m54s)



[into before on my own project so I was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h11m56s)



[glad somebody was willing to pick this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m00s)



[up so here's the issue for it and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m01s)



[there's already a corresponding pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m03s)



[request for it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m04s)



[so in short on the snack bar you're able](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m06s)



[to in cue messages but being able to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m10s)



[ignore duplicates had to be done on a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m13s)



[per message basis which always felt a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m17s)



[little awkward at times which was I was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m19s)



[clearly not alone in that because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m23s)



[ultimately especially if you're using](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m26s)



[the message queue you want to go through](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m27s)



[and actually turn it off at the queue](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m29s)



[level and just sort of have I won't say](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m31s)



[a global setting but one that applies to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m35s)



[every message that goes through that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m37s)



[queue so I had put a few docs on here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m39s)



[and it was pretty simple new boolean](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m44s)



[property and then check it on the pump](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m47s)



[async so we are going to check the pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m49s)



[request for this and I believe it is as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m52s)



[simple as that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m56s)



[so this is the pull request for it and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h12m57s)



[let's come down here and we'll just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m04s)



[check this one and I think it should be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m07s)



[as simple as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m09s)



[so check box for the demo app and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m11s)



[there is a property on the message queue](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m18s)



[it is important to note that the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m21s)



[snackbar message queue I'll pull that up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m23s)



[real quick is not a it's not a it can't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m25s)



[have a dependency property on it because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m34s)



[it doesn't derive from dependency object](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m35s)



[so that's why this property isn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m37s)



[necessarily bindable so if people are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m40s)



[wanting to bind to this there's going to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m43s)



[be a little bit more work that needs to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m44s)



[go in but given that this is a new](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m46s)



[feature and not necessarily just a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m48s)



[straight-up object I'm not sure that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m50s)



[that's a big deal that might be a nice](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m55s)



[enhancement in the future if somebody](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m57s)



[wants to go through and look at actually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h13m58s)



[making these properties bindable but it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m00s)



[does add a bit of overhead and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m03s)



[complexity to make this into a bindable](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m04s)



[object so but ultimately if ignored](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m06s)



[duplicate is on let's see here let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m09s)



[check this out because I want to this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m20s)



[guy is what is around this so if ignored](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m25s)



[duplicate but is this actually doing and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m32s)



[ignore all oh I think this if no because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m35s)



[this duplicates the same message you can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m47s)



[or duplicate so this is correct okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m49s)



[cool so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m51s)



[easy merge for newer stuff I would](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h14m59s)



[probably also ask for a unit test on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m10s)



[that but given that this was submitted](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m13s)



[long before we had a unit test project](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m15s)



[on here I am I don't retro actively add](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m17s)



[requirements so this meets all the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m20s)



[requirements that were put on there in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m22s)



[the initial bit so good enough for me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m23s)



[so we will Oh before we do that I want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m26s)



[to sneak this guy into what we will do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m30s)



[that delete our branch from squash and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m35s)



[merge and all the things go through](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m39s)



[perfect I was thinking there was a lot](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m44s)



[of easy items easy to boost my](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m49s)



[confidence quick okay I've lost my place](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m51s)



[let's go back milestones and to 6-0 and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h15m56s)



[this guy should have gotten resolved](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m04s)



[when the pull request went but clearly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m08s)



[it didn't so we can just close it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m10s)



[because it should be yeah it's linked](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m15s)



[right there typically if you put as one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m18s)



[of the lines in your description fixes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m22s)



[pound and then the issue number it'll](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m24s)



[auto close these which makes it mildly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m25s)



[nicer for me but not a big deal okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m27s)



[color picker add hue sliding so let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m32s)



[see which one this is where we start](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m35s)



[getting into the more interesting ones](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m37s)



[so this is going to be a change to the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m38s)



[new color picker control so two six zero](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m43s)



[we added a color picker control to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m46s)



[support all of the new theming stuff so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m49s)



[because there is actually the ability to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m51s)



[pick arbitrary colors we wanted an a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m55s)



[reasonable color picker built-in ideally](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h16m58s)



[something that was kind of similar ish](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m01s)



[to the way the material design picker](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m03s)



[works so we got something close to that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m06s)



[update icon pack is just a script](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m09s)



[so little less concerned but you know](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m12s)



[what let's go through and do let's do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m17s)



[this one first because this is this will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m19s)



[be this will be another quick and easy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m21s)



[win and then anybody using the preview](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m23s)



[packages can pick it up so right now the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m26s)



[the icons built in the library are built](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m31s)



[with a script and that script has to be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m34s)



[manually run which is a little obnoxious](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m37s)



[I do have plans to add it in so right](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m40s)



[now we're kind of in a transition period](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m44s)



[between a purveyor and Azure DevOps so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m46s)



[I've got both Azure DevOps running as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m50s)



[well as app they're running](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m52s)



[simultaneously so when you do a pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m54s)



[request the verification you see is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m56s)



[coming from Azure DevOps but when it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h17m58s)



[actually does the new get package build](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m01s)



[and release that's coming out of app](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m02s)



[there so I've got the the azure DevOps](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m04s)



[building it it's a matter of get once](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m08s)



[I'm confident that it's working the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m10s)



[exact same as what app fare is doing I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m12s)



[gonna switch over the new get publish](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m14s)



[out of out there and then we can let out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m17s)



[there just kind of sit there for a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m18s)



[little bit not being used and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m20s)



[eventually it can go away and we can use](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m22s)



[DevOps for all of it the other advantage](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m24s)



[of DevOps is I'm wanting to put in an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m27s)



[automatic script so that it runs say](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m31s)



[nightly or weekly and just goes and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m35s)



[pings out looking to see if there's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m38s)



[updates to the material design icons and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m39s)



[then runs through and queues up a pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m41s)



[request that way when there's changes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m44s)



[we'll get an automatic pull request that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m46s)



[comes in and that can be reviewed and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m48s)



[merged and actually get that going so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m51s)



[I'm hoping that will be a simple thing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m53s)



[to do again not a hundred percent](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m57s)



[confident if somebody wants to take a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h18m59s)



[stab at doing a simple PowerShell script](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m01s)



[for that that's probably the way I was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m04s)



[looking at doing it there's a few other](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m07s)



[things that I'm looking to get scripted](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m09s)



[as part of the DevOps pipeline but that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m10s)



[should be simple so for anyone](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m13s)



[interested in actually like if you want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m16s)



[to see where the resource generation](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m19s)



[happens there's an extra solution file](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m20s)



[right at the root of the repo some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m22s)



[material design](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m25s)



[we'll get resource generation solution](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m25s)



[and then this guy fires up and I always](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m27s)



[have to open program CS because I can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m31s)



[never remember exactly how this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m33s)



[works it sounds like my dog is excited](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m35s)



[about something let's see so I need to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m39s)



[pass in what to my main method so if we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m44s)



[pass in args generate zamel generate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m49s)



[JSON all swatches because we also](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m53s)



[generate the color themes come on come](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h19m57s)



[on Visual Studio you can do it I promise](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m04s)



[it's not that hard to open a solution](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m06s)



[I'm sure it's actually probably the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m08s)



[resharper going and trying to grep the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m10s)



[entire solution so if we pass in a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m13s)



[argument of icons it'll do the icon](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m18s)



[thing and run great so I think I might](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m21s)



[even have this already set because I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m25s)



[think doing icons was the last thing I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m27s)



[did anyway](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m29s)



[but for command-line apps if people](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m29s)



[haven't done this before you can either](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m32s)



[go and just manually invoke them on the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m34s)



[command line but on your debug it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m36s)



[doesn't look like I have it you can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m38s)



[actually just specify command line](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m40s)



[arguments to get past when you launch](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m44s)



[this thing with debugging which can be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m46s)



[very convenient so let's just we'll just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m49s)



[fire this guy up and verify that we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m52s)



[actually do the icon thing and so this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h20m54s)



[will actually run go out query all the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m00s)



[latest icons on the material design](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m02s)



[icons dotnet pull them down and build](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m04s)



[out the e new one of the changes that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m07s)



[went in in to 500 I think is rather than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m09s)



[just using one Enuma you because there's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m13s)



[a lot of names for a given icon it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m17s)



[actually generates duplicate a new muse](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m20s)



[for with the various names for it but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m23s)



[then there was a we had a bug with that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m28s)



[in that II new members can't differ just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m30s)



[by case in the zamel even though they](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m33s)



[can and c-sharp so there's a fix in here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m34s)



[in that it'll only grab the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m37s)

[that it sees for casein which i think is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m41s)



[fine ish there's probably some special](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m43s)



[cases that need to be worked out but I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m45s)



[have not actually gone through the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m47s)



[entire Inu member to make sure so this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m50s)



[guy fires up we hit our breakpoint great](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m53s)



[so we are actually doing the icons](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m57s)



[everything works the way we expect and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h21m59s)



[we'll just let it go so go get me my](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m01s)



[icons please and then hopefully this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m04s)



[shows us a whole bunch of inium changes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m10s)



[along with a whole lot of zamel changes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m15s)



[as well to go along with the scalar](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m21s)



[icons for each of these again one of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m24s)



[things that I am hoping to do is to get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m29s)



[this script running automatically like I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m31s)



[said either on like a nightly or a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m35s)



[weekly basis just so that we don't fall](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m36s)



[behind because it very consistently](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m39s)



[happens I try to keep an eye on the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m41s)



[material design icons but I have a lot](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m44s)



[of things to keep an eye on and it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m47s)



[very common that they get a release out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m49s)



[and I don't even notice so I do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m50s)



[appreciate when people at least let me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m53s)



[know and if people want to submit pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m56s)



[requests where all you do is run the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m57s)



[script and say hey there's new icons](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h22m59s)



[here's the pull request for it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m01s)



[even better I approve it can be a quick](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m02s)



[and easy win because this does take just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m07s)



[a minute while that's running Oh show](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m09s)



[what it's actually doing in here so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m12s)



[there's some fancy fancy code in here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m14s)



[where it actually so pulls down all the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m16s)



[icons updating new the the interesting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m19s)



[part in this is the way that it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m23s)



[actually building up the c-sharp so it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m24s)



[going through some of the code analysis](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m26s)



[api's to actually go through and build](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m30s)



[out the c-sharp so that it's reasonably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m33s)



[generated so it's not just doing string](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m37s)



[munging and string concatenation it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m39s)



[being somewhat intelligent about it and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m41s)



[formatting and all of that chess which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m44s)



[which makes it much nicer and it also](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m46s)



[means that it takes it a little bit](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m49s)



[longer](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m51s)



[especially with all of that parsing that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m52s)



[is in there what are you though normally](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h23m56s)



[doesn't take me this long usually it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m01s)



[runs from maybe a minute maybe two it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m03s)



[could be because I'm streaming and it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m07s)



[doesn't have a lot of stuff because it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m08s)



[downloaded that fairly quickly and for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m10s)



[each of these inu members it does have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m13s)



[to loop for a little while I just make](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m14s)



[sure we're still chugging along at a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m19s)



[happy clip so far so good okay well well](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m21s)



[you think about what you've done](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m30s)



[no finished excellent okay let's go see](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m31s)



[what you did and I was on the wrong](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m35s)



[branch so we will want to switch back](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m39s)



[get me back on master please and pull up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m43s)



[I think we can just whack this other one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m50s)



[here come on I know you want a stache](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h24m57s)



[and then pole I should have pulled first](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m03s)



[go ahead and think about it and I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m06s)



[we can be done with our resource](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m11s)



[generation yeah I know the new version](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m14s)



[and get crackin occasionally gets itself](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m18s)



[confused when you try to pull up on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m20s)



[things and it can't figure out how to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m22s)



[pop its - so let's just clean up this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m23s)



[history tree real quick and it'll figure](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m26s)



[itself out so delete we're gonna pop our](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m28s)



[stash back on top a master there should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m31s)



[be no conflicts great that looks better](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m35s)



[okay so come back through here so pack](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m38s)



[icon data factory I believe this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m43s)



[gonna be the one with all of the icon](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m47s)



[the actual SVG data yeah so this is one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m52s)



[really really really big line I'm not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m56s)



[even gonna try to read it though usually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h25m59s)



[I I will I balled this one so arrow left](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m02s)



[right right bow](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m05s)



[so we picked up quite a few icons](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m06s)



[clockwise so this is what you'll notice](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m12s)



[when I was commenting that it uses all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m15s)



[the e new members for something so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m17s)



[there's an icon called Auto renew but it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m19s)



[also has aliases for clockwise arrows](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m22s)



[circular arrows and circle arrows so you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m25s)



[can use any of these inu members but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m28s)



[you're still going to end up even though](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m31s)



[there for any new members you're still](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m33s)



[going to end up with the same icon in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m34s)



[each of them so when you see those](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m35s)



[that's all that is is different aliases](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m37s)



[the same thing there so this looks](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m39s)



[pretty good I'm going to assume refiner](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m45s)



[I was like looking at the removals just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m47s)



[to see scatterplot hex bin see the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m51s)



[only thing I don't like about this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m56s)



[this is technically a breaking change oh](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h26m58s)



[I should probably call these out so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m03s)



[let's go because I always try to make](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m06s)



[sure people know in general we try to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m08s)



[follow semver for all of the changes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m11s)



[however there's certain breaking changes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m14s)



[that I'm willing to allow through](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m16s)



[without necessarily revving the major](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m22s)



[version with just the release notes so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m24s)



[it's specifically for your pack icons if](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m26s)



[you update into a version and you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m30s)



[realize that something's not working](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m32s)



[check the release notes I've tried to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m33s)



[always call out when one of these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m35s)



[changes and what's the the new the new](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m37s)



[name for it because a lot of times](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m41s)



[because this is an external dependency](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m43s)



[when they update things like this simple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m45s)



[case in between lowercase P and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m50s)



[uppercase P can cause people problems so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m52s)



[just be aware of that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m56s)



[let's go through and I just want to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h27m58s)



[document these guys real quick so I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m00s)



[don't lose track of them so let's jump](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m02s)



[over to my releases page and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m08s)



[so I do keep a running release notes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m15s)



[that are on here so these this two 601](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m21s)



[people won't likely see but let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m28s)



[actually put this as part of the wiki I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m30s)



[think is the easier place also in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m32s)



[regards to the wiki if people ever want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m35s)



[to help out and edit please feel free to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m37s)



[edit this this is not just my just for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m39s)



[me to edit this is it's open to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m45s)



[everybody and so if you find something](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m46s)



[that's wrong or you want to contribute](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m49s)



[something please feel free you don't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m51s)



[necessarily always need to ask question](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m53s)



[if it's this looks like you type out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m55s)



[something Kevin the answer is I probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m56s)



[type out something a lot of times these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h28m58s)



[are done quickly and I thought I had a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m01s)



[release notes page in here but maybe](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m03s)



[it's just on the releases page okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m06s)



[maybe it's just here so we're going to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m10s)



[edit this one and you'll notice this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m13s)



[a draft release so you won't necessarily](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m15s)



[see you won't necessarily see this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m18s)



[showing up for everybody this is mostly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m24s)



[where I keep my own release notes so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m26s)



[that people can have them I just build](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m30s)



[them as stuff gets merged so pack icon](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m34s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m40s)



[name changes so we are just going to and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m42s)



[I'm trying to remember how to is it one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m47s)



[two three indent I think this is how you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m50s)



[do it yeah or just to indent I think it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m54s)



[just might be to markdown wizard I am](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h29m59s)



[not so this guy was changed to this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m04s)



[because I'm less concerned with adding](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m14s)



[in the new ones and more concerned with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m16s)



[adding in the breaking icons which is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m18s)



[going to be all around these deletes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m22s)



[mail email](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m25s)



[so this the male alias was just removed](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m30s)



[so if you were using male switch to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m41s)



[email and that will take care of that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m45s)



[one okay perfect so keep that draft](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m48s)



[going just so that we have those issues](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m53s)



[documented and updating pack icons fixes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h30m55s)



[and let's grab that already it's safe](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m05s)



[drive tonight](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m09s)



[great let's see 12 76 and this one we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m10s)



[aren't going to necessarily pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m17s)



[requests I'm just gonna cowboy it in and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m18s)



[be done that should knock another one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m20s)



[off the plate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m28s)



[a half-hour in and we've already knocked](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m34s)



[off most the issues now to be fair I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m37s)



[knocked off all the easy issues so that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m39s)



[guy is now closed okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m42s)



[so where to go next where to go next](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m46s)



[where to go next I think I probably want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m50s)



[to pick on this outline text field box](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m53s)



[because if I remember right this one was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m57s)



[the easier one to look at so bug 1282](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h31m59s)



[it's this bug not in this bug didn't get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m08s)



[milestone well let's fix that there we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m15s)



[go so this is the the the issue here so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m20s)



[if you go through and create a text box](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m26s)



[with the material design outline text](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m29s)



[field box and set a background on it the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m32s)



[background is actually expanding over](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m35s)



[the top of this border basically the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m38s)



[border has a rounded color this guy was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m40s)



[sitting on top and normally if you don't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m43s)



[set a background color it just lets the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m45s)



[border show through and you have no idea](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m49s)



[that it's writing on top so but the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m51s)



[moment you set a background color you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m53s)



[now get this ugly looking corner and it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m54s)



[ruins the nice rounded edge so we had a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h32m56s)



[wonderful pull request here but I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m02s)



[for this one we're gonna actually check](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m05s)



[it out and make sure everything's are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m07s)



[working so pull requests 1283 so let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m08s)



[get master should be pulled up let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m13s)



[check out 1283 we'll go take a look at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m17s)



[these changes all it's thinking about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m22s)



[that I just kind of want to eyeball this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m25s)



[so all of these changes here basically](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m27s)



[the the change was rather than having](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m32s)



[the template binding for the background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m37s)



[brush being applied to this inner border](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m40s)



[to move that template biting to the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m42s)



[outer border which is what actually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m45s)



[ends up getting the corner radius set on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m49s)



[it so this is the border inside the one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m51s)



[that actually had the gray outline this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m55s)



[is the guy that was able to ride outside](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h33m57s)



[the other thing that would have probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m00s)



[worked as well is to just apply the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m03s)



[corner radius down here so that this one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m05s)



[also gets clipped appropriately but due](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m09s)



[to this padding I'm not necessarily sure](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m12s)



[if that's the rule that's probably not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m13s)



[the right that's not the right fix I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m16s)



[think this is probably the better fix](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m19s)



[the one thing that I want to look at is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m22s)



[whether we actually need to set the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m24s)



[background to transparent or whether we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m26s)



[can just omit it so in WPF there is a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m28s)



[difference between not setting a brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m31s)



[and setting a brush to transparent](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m34s)



[visually they end up looking the same](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m37s)



[but transparent can cause different hit](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m39s)



[testing so when you go to click if you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m46s)



[have an element that has a background of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m49s)



[transparent it is available for that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m51s)



[elements available for hit testing as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m56s)



[it's trying to figure out what element](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m57s)



[is underneath your mouse whereas if you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h34m59s)



[omit the background altogether it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m01s)



[usually won't be hit test visible and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m03s)



[it'll fall all the way through I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m05s)



[realized they use the phrase hit test](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m08s)



[visible and there's a property that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m10s)



[matches that name slightly different so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m12s)



[in general if you can avoid setting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m15s)



[transparent and just omit the background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m17s)



[it's slightly more performant just for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m19s)



[that reason so we're gonna take a peek](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m21s)



[first of all to make sure that this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m24s)



[works which I suspect it does and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m25s)



[we're going to try dropping the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m29s)



[background altogether and make sure that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m31s)



[it still works and I think that should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m33s)



[be all that it takes so there's that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m36s)



[visual studio reload the universe yep go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m39s)



[think about go think about everything](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m43s)



[and we'll walk through and do this so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m46s)



[for this issue I think it was as simple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m48s)



[as just this guy here and setting the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m53s)



[background I tend to pick fuchsia](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m55s)



[whenever I want a visual to do because I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h35m56s)



[find fuchsia to be one of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m00s)



[the bigger eyesore colors and so every](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m02s)



[time I see a large block a few should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m05s)



[says ah you forgot to finish something](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m07s)



[here some people may use it in their app](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m09s)



[I tend to avoid it but that's just me I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m12s)



[am also not a designer so I would not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m17s)



[take color advice from me cuz I'm on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m18s)



[visual studio I know this is hard I know](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m23s)



[this is hard at some point I am looking](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m24s)



[at getting a slightly better streaming](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m31s)



[setup so that I don't have quite this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m34s)



[lag when I'm going through and doing it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m36s)



[because just running this is chewing 40%](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m38s)



[of my CPU and that doesn't count visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m42s)



[studio and resharper trying to help okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m44s)



[so that guy is now loaded so let's go up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m52s)



[and first of all let's go change](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h36m56s)



[something in our demo apps so that we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m00s)



[actually have it because this pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m02s)



[request only changed the style and we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m03s)



[want to pick on changing the background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m07s)



[color of something equivalent so there's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m12s)



[that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m16s)



[oh sure you'll work so background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m17s)



[fuchsia great sorry just checking to see](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m24s)



[what's going on here so this is the one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m31s)



[next to the checkbox okay perfect so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m34s)



[I'll make sure I'm not completely crazy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m37s)



[sweet well that goes and loads up there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m53s)



[was something I was gonna mention to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h37m58s)



[there was a awesome control that got so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m00s)



[the the term in Android is Action Button](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m05s)



[and I think that's probably what it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m08s)



[called in the material design spec as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m11s)



[well I'd have to double-check but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m12s)



[somebody was asking in the chat about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m15s)



[going through and building one out see](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m17s)



[if I could find that image real quick](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m23s)



[yeah this guy here somebody in the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m26s)



[get er chat was asking about building up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m33s)



[a control that looked like this and so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m35s)



[in the in our library we've already got](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m37s)



[a pop-up box that has a style where you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m40s)



[can effectively get this kind of button](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m42s)



[effect going through but our current one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m44s)



[doesn't allow for basically having these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m47s)



[labels off to the side so just as a fun](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m49s)



[programming problem I may take that on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m54s)



[at some point because this looks like a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m57s)



[fun control to build I personally](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h38m59s)



[haven't needed it in any of my apps but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m02s)



[I know that this is a very common design](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m04s)



[especially among mobile developers and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m07s)



[so this might be a fun one to build out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m10s)



[so that we have a nice simplistic style](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m12s)



[to work with so if anyone wants to play](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m14s)



[around doing that go for it I do think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m17s)



[this type of edition because like I said](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m20s)



[we've already got the the pop-up box](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m23s)



[where it'll take the list of buttons and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m25s)



[style and out like this for you what's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m28s)



[missing is the ability to specify this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m29s)



[label on top of it which i think would](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m32s)



[be a nice addition to the library so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m34s)



[let's go back here and we've got this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m38s)



[guy let's grab our text box fields and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m41s)



[we are looking for the big one with a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m52s)



[checkbox that has a lot of fuchsia so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m54s)



[this is going to be a hard one to see so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h39m59s)



[the magnifier please](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m03s)



[because unfortunately we need to zoom](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m06s)



[all the way in on this guy so I believe](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m08s)



[it is Windows Plus and that looks a lot](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m13s)



[better it's now this guy's properly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m20s)



[getting blocked which I believe is the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m25s)



[expected look it is interesting to me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m29s)



[that that corner seems to be getting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m32s)



[lightened](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m34s)



[so let's zoom that back out but that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m36s)



[could just be the sub-pixel rendering](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m39s)



[and it's interesting to me okay now I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m44s)



[have to look so let's see if we can do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m51s)



[this let's remove the background color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h40m55s)



[set it all together and then take a look](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m01s)



[at that because I think that could just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m03s)



[be the border the way that ends up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m04s)



[looking come on live Sam we'll update oh](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m07s)



[come on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m12s)



[deleting a background color should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m14s)



[totally do it oh I guess we can look at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m16s)



[the one down below because it's the same](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m18s)



[style look at this corner yeah it must](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m20s)



[be it must be with the magnifier and the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m28s)



[sub-pixel rendering that on that rounded](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m31s)



[corner it seems to lighten okay so I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m33s)



[not gonna I'm not going to stress about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m37s)



[it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m39s)



[so that appears to work so the last](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m39s)



[thing we want to look at then is on this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m43s)



[style I'm gonna take me there so this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m45s)



[guy here keep going down keep going down](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m52s)



[okay so the change here so this is the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h41m55s)



[the border where the hang on what's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m00s)



[going on what's going on here are we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m04s)



[looking at the wrong one textfield no](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m11s)



[template by it so here's the outer](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m15s)



[border this is the one where it used to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m17s)



[be good](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m19s)



[applied it currently as a background of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m20s)



[transparent I believe we can just whack](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m22s)



[that because harder coding that to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m25s)



[transparent does nothing for us um let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m28s)



[fire that up and make sure we get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m35s)



[let's make sure we pick that that up and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m46s)



[as long as that looks the same I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m48s)



[we'll just update this PR with that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m51s)



[change and merge it in and I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m53s)



[that'll bring it through then we'll be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h42m56s)



[getting really really close as I'd](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m03s)



[really like to get this to 6o release](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m06s)



[it's been kind of sitting on the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m08s)

[out for like a month now](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m13s)



[and unfortunately due to my lack of free](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m15s)



[time it's just been sitting there so I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m17s)



[do appreciate everybody submitting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m22s)



[issues and pull requests it's been great](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m24s)



[there was a question that came up on one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m26s)



[of the issues of somebody asking what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m30s)



[the holdup was and the short answer is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m31s)



[it's me I only have a certain number of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m32s)



[free hours in a week to devote to open](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m36s)



[source work and so I I try to allocate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m38s)



[as many as I can but unfortunately my](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m41s)



[current life setup with small children](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m44s)



[requires me to focus on them so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m48s)



[hopefully that frees up a little bit but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m52s)



[we'll see I enjoy doing this and I do it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m55s)



[a lot for fun so okay so there we are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h43m59s)



[and windows Plus and same effect on that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m03s)



[corner excellent excellent excellent](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m09s)



[excellent excellent excellent perfect so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m13s)



[we can you know put that change in on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m19s)



[the pull request so view changes we only](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m24s)



[want this change bring it forward please](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m27s)



[and then I think that should be it so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m30s)



[it's just the the whacking of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m37s)



[transparent on the background removing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m38s)



[parent background setter so commit](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m42s)



[change and again functionally or I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m48s)



[should say visually those two things are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m51s)



[identical the only difference and we can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m54s)



[revert this change the only difference](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h44m57s)



[be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m00s)



[between transparent and unset is a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m00s)



[little bit of performance when it comes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m04s)



[to figuring out what elements you can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m06s)



[click on so also if you're wondering](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m10s)



[like if you're trying to catch Mouse](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m13s)



[events on like a grid or something and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m14s)



[you can't get them that's almost](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m17s)



[assuredly because there is no background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m19s)



[and it's you're not able to register](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m21s)



[that so set a background color of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h45m23s)

[we're gonna find out if not it's a small](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m50s)



[enough change to go back so yeah force](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h46m55s)

[mistakes Hey look at that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m06s)



[see I didn't make a mistake](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m10s)



[don't know what you talk about method or](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m13s)



[why don't we hit oh because control is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m21s)



[no interesting I betcha that was because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m26s)



[we changed the control out from under it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m30s)



[and the live sam'l update didn't know](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m33s)



[how to handle that that's okay I am less](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m35s)



[concerned about those type of issues so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m39s)



[now we refresh hopefully that guy jumps](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m42s)



[off okay background is set that is set](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m47s)



[we drop this set are all together great](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h47m54s)



[prove that and let's merge it in should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m07s)



[probably wait for the checks probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m16s)



[there's like there's no this is the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m21s)



[weird part is there's not actually going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m24s)



[to be unit tests on this so we might](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m25s)



[just squash a merge and go let's do this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m30s)



[so that goes through and so this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m35s)



[should be closed this guy now auto](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m40s)



[closes and once again we are getting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m43s)



[closer this guy is and I wish there was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m47s)



[an easy way to get back to my milestone](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m54s)



[and that'll work](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m56s)



[okay so I think that guy should be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h48m59s)



[closed now and we're down to two so bug](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m04s)



[or hue slider option anyone have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m08s)



[suggestions do people care we've](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m13s)



[reviewed a bunch of PRS let's pick](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m24s)



[something we'll just start with the bug](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m25s)



[so basically on this one so we added](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m28s)



[this new button assist corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m32s)



[right and the the issue being the ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m35s)



[itself is now able to ride on top of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m39s)



[button and so if you're looking closely](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m42s)



[you'll notice that the ripple now](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m45s)



[extends over the top of the button so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m46s)



[let's take a look at fixing it this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m50s)



[shouldn't be too terribly difficult step](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h49m53s)

[go go go go go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m08s)



[and then I don't need this branch](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m11s)



[anymore because we merged it and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h50m13s)

[the apps that people go through and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m30s)



[build with this so projects using](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m31s)



[material design so if if anybody builds](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m34s)



[an app and you are interested in it feel](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m38s)



[free to to drop it in here with a link](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m40s)

[you're able to at least show a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m57s)



[screenshot in a link I don't care if](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h52m59s)



[it's open-source or something for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m00s)



[enterprise type work if you're able to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m04s)

[people enjoy seeing the the types of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m09s)



[stuff other people build okay so color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m11s)



[picker and I think if I okay resharper](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m16s)

[the color picker control directly and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m26s)



[then okay sweet so I think what we'll do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m29s)



[is I'll just fire this up in the demo](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m35s)



[app and then try talking this just with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m36s)



[the live sam'l edit and see and see how](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m42s)



[it looks but I assume if it does let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m47s)



[see what do we got](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m50s)



[so style for the repeat button target](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m52s)



[I'll repeat button is are these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h53m58s)



[different styles in here just because of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m04s)



[the different orientations I assume](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m06s)



[vertical and horizontal have slightly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m08s)



[different layouts okay that's what I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m11s)



[thought oh good we kind of already named](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m17s)



[it that way](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m25s)



[perfect reorder some slider vertical](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m30s)



[retention reorienting let's press and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m38s)



[hold an abled oh nice I often times free](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m43s)



[forget about some of the stylist stuff](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m50s)



[oh but I guess that wasn't there prior](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m52s)



[so that could have been Robert Snipes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m56s)



[that put that in that is one thing that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h54m59s)



[I am always somewhat sloppy about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m02s)



[because most of the time for my WPF apps](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m04s)



[I'm not dealing with touch interaction](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m07s)



[so I do technically have a surface go I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m10s)



[could I could test things on with a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m13s)



[touch screen but for people who keep an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m16s)



[eye out for stuff like the stylus and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m19s)



[the touch interaction I do appreciate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m20s)



[that because that is always a one of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m22s)



[those blind spots that bites me every so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m25s)



[often i panelist you sided position so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m27s)



[that just moves that guy around inside](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m34s)



[of the doc panel and that moves it okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m37s)



[sweet let's see how it rolls look I mean](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m41s)



[it all looks I don't see anything](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m45s)



[jumping out at me so as long as it works](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m46s)



[I see no reason we can't just merge this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m49s)



[guy in so let's fire it up and see how](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m51s)



[it goes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m55s)



[I believe that guy is going to be the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h55m55s)



[color tool so let's do there is kind of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m00s)



[an outstanding item I know I've](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m08s)



[mentioned it on stream before of things](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m09s)



[that that need to get done is there is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m12s)



[your app will behave very weird if you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m15s)



[try to use the new to 6/0 theming](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m19s)



[libraries in combination with the old](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m21s)



[palette helper methods it won't work](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m23s)



[right the one is expecting to replace](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m27s)



[and one is expecting to append to the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m31s)



[resource dictionary and so you'll end up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m33s)



[with extra resources things won't change](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m35s)



[or you'll get sort of it changed the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m37s)



[first time but not the second](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m39s)



[type behavior so don't do that at some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m41s)



[point and I don't know if I'll get to it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m45s)



[before to 600 releases I want to go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m47s)



[through the demo app and remove all of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m50s)



[the old palette helper invocations those](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m52s)



[methods are still going to be there and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m55s)



[they still work so if you upgrade to to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m56s)



[600 and you don't want to do the new](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h56m58s)



[theming stuff and you're using the old](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m00s)



[API is great you can leave it it all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m01s)



[works just fine the only thing you can't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m04s)



[do is mix the old API s and the new API](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m06s)



[is together so if you start switching](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m08s)



[over the API calls change them all over](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m11s)



[don't change half of them or you will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m13s)



[have a bad day because unfortunately I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m15s)



[don't know of a way to change that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m19s)



[without implementing breaking changes so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m21s)



[okay so and I believe it's this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m24s)



[right here so that defaults to the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m27s)



[bottom and let's go find where this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m30s)



[is located so color picker uniform grade](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m33s)



[uniform grid secondary I'm already I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m41s)



[at the uniform grids I'm too low this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m43s)



[guy should have been above me selection](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m46s)



[controls oh come on where are you what's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m51s)



[the name of this guy color picker there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h57m57s)



[we go so let's do something like you you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m05s)



[slider doc wasn't it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m14s)



[come on some intellisense would be great](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m21s)



[some intellisense would be great](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m26s)



[slight a position okay so let's go there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m30s)



[oh that looked are there nice that is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m35s)



[interesting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m42s)



[so uh so left bottom it's probably part](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m43s)



[of the live zamel thing changing the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m54s)



[dock it's causing it to reset the slider](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h58m56s)



[position that's probably okay because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m00s)



[ultimately what's happening is well](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m07s)



[let's look I think the answer is it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m10s)



[swapping out one of the data templates](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m14s)



[with the style trigger which is somewhat](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m16s)



[expected nope wrong project let's go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m19s)



[look real quick that's probably okay I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m24s)



[don't I think most people are probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m26s)



[gonna have their so let's let's do this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m29s)



[real quick set it to the right this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m32s)



[nice I am wondering what's causing this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m40s)



[extra margin at the top and bottom](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m43s)



[verses when I put it on the bottom](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m48s)



[it's that same margin there I guess it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m50s)



[is it is shortened okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m54s)



[let's do this I just want to relaunch](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=00h59m59s)



[and make sure that this slider position](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m02s)



[because I know the live zamel edit and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m06s)



[continue does very bizarre weird things](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m09s)



[at times](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m13s)



[and I just want to make sure that when](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m14s)



[we load it up this guy was setting an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m16s)



[initial color and I just want to make](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m19s)



[sure that that when the slider is docked](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m21s)



[vertically that it reloads that color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m23s)



[correctly which I assume it does because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m25s)



[there was nothing in those templates](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m27s)



[that should cause any breakage and if](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m29s)



[you're using this control in your apt](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m34s)



[I'd just be aware that at least in the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m38s)



[demo app I put this delay on here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m41s)



[because the app gets pretty laggy I've](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m43s)



[wanted to go back and look at the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m46s)



[performance and see what can be done](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m48s)



[about it but ultimately it ends up doing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m49s)



[a couple color conversions while you're](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m52s)



[dragging so it converts it to HSV color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m56s)



[space does the conversion and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h00m59s)



[converts it back to RGB so it tends to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m02s)



[be a little slow and so I put this delay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m05s)



[on the binding just to keep the thing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m08s)



[relatively responsive you may need to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m10s)



[play with that a little on yours at some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m12s)



[point I suspect we're gonna need to do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m14s)



[something a little a little nicer but I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m16s)



[don't know how to quite get around it oh](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m18s)



[yeah that works right yeah then added](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m22s)



[more conversions after that that makes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m26s)



[sense yeah so I like it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m28s)



[I like it tied and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m39s)



[should just magically work I'm one so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m47s)



[one last thing I want to check so there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m54s)



[are the I made the mistake of actually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h01m56s)



[writing unit s over this control but I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m00s)



[don't think there's anything in here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m03s)



[that really makes that big of a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m06s)



[difference dragging the slider huge](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m08s)



[changes the slider yeah I'm a little](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m13s)



[less concerned so there's this really](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m18s)



[weird fine line about unit testing a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m20s)



[theme library like this I feel like we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m22s)



[should unit test the controls themselves](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m26s)



[because there's functionality in there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m28s)



[that should be unit tested but obviously](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m30s)



[we can't test things like the style](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m32s)



[triggers in the sample those are either](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m34s)



[UI tests or actual like code monkey run](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m36s)



[the test and given that this thing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m41s)



[clearly passed CI I believe yep I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m46s)



[gonna say it looks good so great worked](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m53s)



[I'd I will take it so approve](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h02m57s)



[and submit review and we will merge that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m08s)



[in and now we'll go and fix a bug and I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m11s)



[think I think we might get this hole to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m21s)



[six oh release all knocked out the door](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m24s)



[awesome and so if you're wanting to pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m30s)



[the latest stuff tied up vert should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m34s)



[have it's probably just kicking off like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m37s)



[crazy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m40s)



[it runs NuGet packages on every commit](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m41s)



[to master Oh glad glad to enjoy have you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m43s)



[been using it in your new app the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m48s)



[two 6o deeming stuff I mean awesome](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h03m51s)



[and I'm guessing based upon that it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m03s)



[been working working rather well which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m06s)



[is which is good I I've been trying to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m09s)



[see if people are actually using the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m12s)



[preview nougats so I try to watch the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m15s)



[download numbers just to see if if it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m16s)



[actually getting tested I hate to push](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m18s)



[stuff out and then find out breaking](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m21s)



[issues later Oh awesome that is what we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m23s)



[like to hear so I can only claim some of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m26s)



[the credit for the new theming stuff](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m30s)



[Robert snipe did a lot of the initial](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m32s)



[work including that color picker control](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m35s)



[I just came behind him and got stuff](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m38s)



[merged in and took credit for a lot of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m43s)



[stuff so but he actually did a lot of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m44s)



[the work and there's actually more](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m47s)



[features potentially coming with it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m51s)



[there was we kind of scrapped he has](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m54s)



[several additional pieces that he wanted](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h04m57s)



[data into it that I wasn't sure we're](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m00s)



[fully ready yet or we're still being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m02s)



[worked on and so we got kind of the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m05s)



[core theming stuff changed and in but I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m07s)



[think it laid a much better foundation](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m10s)



[for stuff coming forward so let's go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m12s)



[back to that milestone and night that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m18s)



[last](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m21s)



[ugh](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m21s)



[so 1288 okay so this guy I'm gonna close](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m32s)



[so the visual studio doesn't freak out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m43s)



[which it's about to and then we'll see](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m45s)



[about finding that I think the issue is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m49s)



[probably just where the ripples being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m51s)



[applied with the corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m53s)



[I'm hoping it's as simple as maybe](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m55s)



[setting click the bounds on on something](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m57s)



[but I haven't actually looked in at this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h05m59s)



[code yet to know where it is so I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m01s)



[going at it kind of blind so is this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m03s)



[stuff kind of like a hobby for you tight](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m11s)



[or is this actually for work](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m13s)



[incidentally I'm working on one or two](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m19s)



[more oh cool oh wow that's it is a fun](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m22s)



[hobby so on your color conversion stuff](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m28s)



[if there's anything you want to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m33s)



[contribute back on that I would be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m36s)



[curious to see it I believe and let me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m38s)



[let me go and look I can't remember](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m41s)



[where this landed but there was so there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m43s)



[are some additional color space ones in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m47s)



[this color manipulation yeah yeah these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m51s)



[ones here I had gone through and marked](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m55s)



[them as internal because they weren't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m57s)



[actually being used yet and I didn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h06m59s)



[want so me being lazy I didn't want to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m01s)



[make them part of our public API if I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m04s)



[wasn't ready to eat to actually support](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m05s)



[them but there there's probably some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m08s)



[good use cases for being able to bring](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m12s)



[these other color spaces forward and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m15s)



[potentially have the the color picker](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m17s)



[maybe have an option on their for pick](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m19s)



[the color space you want to work in that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m22s)



[way people can kind of get back the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m25s)



[values that they want and maybe](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m26s)



[potentially avoid some of those odd](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m28s)



[conversions so stuff stuff to be done](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m30s)



[I've done enough stuff with fun color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m35s)



[spaces and computer vision that it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m37s)



[it's interesting I figured you wanted to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m40s)



[keep this simple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m42s)



[yeah at least at least for this release](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m44s)



[I want to keep it simple but I wouldn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m46s)



[mind if you 1d they're open like a pull](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m48s)



[request or an issue and just show what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m51s)



[you ended up doing seeing how other](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m54s)



[people have built out stuff sometimes is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m57s)



[really helpful and kind of trying to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h07m59s)



[shape the API just so that it at least](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m01s)



[meets one person's use case if not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m06s)



[necessarily everybody's cool](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m08s)



[yeah I'll always love looking at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m10s)



[people's stuff okay so let's let's jump](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m13s)



[in here and this is gonna be the button](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m17s)



[stuff and I think was it you tied that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m20s)



[went through and separated out the the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m24s)



[button pages on the demo app trying to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m27s)



[remember I know I had open Oh it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m29s)



[easier to critique they create amen amen](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m32s)



[yeah perfect yeah cuz that thank you for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m37s)



[that by the way this is areas of this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m40s)



[demo app they just kind of grow and get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m43s)



[out of hand and then I realize usually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m46s)



[too late that that we've got a mess on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m48s)



[our hands so I do appreciate the help in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m52s)



[getting that stuff fixed so let's take a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m54s)



[look where is the corner radius ones](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h08m56s)



[buttons with corner radius so that'll](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m03s)



[work there let's see here corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m09s)



[let's just fire this up real quick and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m13s)



[make sure that we can recreate the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m16s)



[problem a step one is always recreate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m19s)



[the problem first and then actually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m23s)



[verify you fix it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m25s)



[so if this is a hobby project for you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m41s)



[tide is your does that mean the app that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m44s)



[you're building with it is open source](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m46s)



[or something that you're keeping closed](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m47s)



[source for now come on is Justin to you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m49s)



[you can do it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m58s)



[I know recompiling is hard](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h09m59s)



[gotcha](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m10s)



[cool yeah and if you ever want somebody](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m13s)



[to take a look at it or critique it I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m17s)



[know there's been several people who](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m19s)



[have posted apps and have just asked for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m20s)



[feedback I'm a little unusual in that I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m21s)



[love doing code reviews for people I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m24s)



[know that usually my co-workers laugh at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m27s)



[me for that one but I actually enjoy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m32s)



[doing them so I found out recently that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m35s)



[on github you can take a look at your](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m39s)



[contributions and I noticed that my code](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m43s)



[reviews on pull requests are almost as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m46s)



[high as my pull requests themselves](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m47s)



[which is fun yeah like I said especially](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m49s)



[people have been helping contribute to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m54s)



[the library I don't mind helping out and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m56s)



[at least reviewing somebody's app and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h10m58s)



[pointing out stuff that I see where was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m01s)



[I going buttons buttons I was doing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m04s)



[corner radiuses that's where we were](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m06s)



[okay so let's see here if we can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m08s)



[actually I need to adjust this has this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m11s)



[been fixed already](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m18s)



[20 50 corner radius okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m20s)

[on there so that we have a better color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h11m31s)

[until the point where it doesn't but I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m15s)



[usually I know people have commented a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m20s)



[lot about different issues with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m22s)



[visual studio designer and I know](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m23s)



[there's air](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m26s)



[is of this library that don't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m26s)



[necessarily play nice with the designer](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m28s)



[a lot of that comes from the fact that I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m30s)



[know at least me and several other](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m34s)



[people that do a lot of WPF development](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m37s)



[one of the first things we usually do is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m39s)



[turn off the designer it can be really](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m41s)



[helpful when you're learning to try to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m45s)



[figure out how to lay things out but a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m46s)



[lot of times I find that it just gets in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m48s)



[the way and I would rather use the live](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m50s)



[at it and continue to know rather than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m52s)



[having to design that shows me what my](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m54s)



[app might look like the Edit continue](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m56s)



[shows me what may happen does look like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h12m58s)



[which is what I would prefer something's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m00s)



[wrong did this actually okay so I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m08s)



[either on the wrong button or this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m14s)



[didn't actually pick up the right bit is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m18s)



[there another 25 no this should be here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m21s)



[a tool tip my crazy button with rounded](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m28s)



[corners that's rounded top corners with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m36s)



[rounded corners ah ha ha I think I am](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m42s)



[looking at the wrong one there we are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m46s)



[there we go now we can see it there's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m48s)



[the fuchsia and it is clearly going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m51s)



[outside okay who just carried myself for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h13m56s)



[a minute so say I didn't think I had](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m00s)



[merged in any changes that should have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m02s)



[addressed this so thank you tide let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m03s)



[go through okay so and actually maybe we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m10s)



[just start and follow it through from](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m16s)



[here and go here okay so I was on the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m20s)



[right style so let's take a little](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m25s)



[gander at where all this stuff goes so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m29s)



[corner radius is being applied here and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m32s)



[the ripple is set out here so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m35s)



[yep that'll do it that will do it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m40s)



[so the ripples going to ride on top this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m46s)



[guy's going to get a corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m50s)



[applied and this guy won't pick it up so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m52s)



[the first question is does ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m57s)



[support corner radius it's a Content](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h14m59s)



[controls the answer is no you sure](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m02s)



[content control doesn't have a corner](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m06s)



[radius because I thought it was only on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m08s)



[certain things that have borders yeah so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m11s)



[no corner radius there but let's go and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m19s)



[look at the ripple control because I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m22s)



[wondering if the solution is simply to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m25s)



[add the corner radius into the ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m27s)



[that must be in the generic so for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m31s)



[anybody going through trying to find](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m36s)



[where things are typically the themes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m38s)



[are all under a corresponding name with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m40s)



[the control however there's a default](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m43s)



[generic one that contains a lot of just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m46s)



[the standard ones so let's just collapse](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m49s)



[the vigil state manager for now and this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h15m55s)



[is effectively where the problem is okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m00s)



[so I think the only option then is to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m05s)



[wrap this guy in a border and clip him](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m10s)



[is that correct I think it is the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m17s)



[problem is then I need to pull all this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m26s)



[stuff out yeah because if I have a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m29s)



[horizontal content alignment of centered](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m40s)



[and a corner radius I expect it to still](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m46s)



[be clipped so oh boy this is going to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h16m51s)



[get interesting fast because if I wrap](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m00s)



[this well okay so the fix for this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m04s)



[going to have to start going down this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m07s)



[path so you get inside so then we want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m08s)



[this guy to pick up the corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m20s)



[same as what that guy does and then more](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m24s)



[importantly we want clip to bounds to be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m29s)



[true so if we set a major corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m34s)



[on this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m38s)



[it's going to go through and effectively](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m39s)



[clip it however this isn't quite going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m41s)



[to work nicely so this will fix our](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m45s)



[immediate problem so if we relaunch this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m50s)



[should address the first problem however](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m55s)



[I think we're still going to have an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m58s)



[issue if we have say a horizontal](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h17m59s)



[content alignment of centered say we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m02s)



[bring the the content of the button in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m05s)



[tiny and then you click on it I would](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m07s)



[still expect the ripple to be around](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m11s)



[that you know centered portion rather](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m12s)



[than being able to expand outside of it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m15s)



[night and this will still allow it to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m16s)



[expand but one problem at a time](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m18s)



[well make sure this properly clips and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m22s)



[then we'll set up the failure case and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m24s)



[verify that we can fix it properly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m26s)



[and I think we might end up actually let](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m30s)



[me just make let's just make both of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m32s)



[these buttons go fuchsia that way we've](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m37s)



[got two test cases to play with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m42s)



[other thing is the live Sam will edit](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m47s)



[and continue does not really play nice](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m50s)



[when you you're editing control Styles](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m53s)



[it sometimes updates but I found that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m56s)



[more often than not it just fails which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h18m59s)



[is frustrating](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m05s)



[so tied while I have you here something](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m15s)



[I had been contemplating doing is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m20s)



[basically putting together a series of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m22s)



[streams and videos one on techniques on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m24s)



[using snoop and then another on just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m29s)



[sort of generic WPF development](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m31s)



[specifically mvvm patterns are either of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m34s)



[those things were those be interesting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m38s)



[to you see here no clipping yes both](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m40s)



[okay good to know](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m54s)



[I started to kind of just write out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m56s)



[outlines of what I wanted to cover for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h19m58s)



[those so why did that not clip so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m01s)



[background blue be bold obnoxious for me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m10s)



[those](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m19s)



[to work but why how are you still able](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m25s)



[to float over the top of that okay I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m34s)



[somewhat confused](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m39s)



[Oh are you living inside of an adorned](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m41s)



[are is that how you're able to do it no](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m44s)



[this is just a canvas with an ellipse](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m50s)



[and the visual state manager I assume](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h20m54s)



[just animates it yeah scale X scale Y](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m01s)



[and opacity yeah nothing fancy on either](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m08s)



[of those it literally just animates an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m13s)



[ellipse inside of a canvas so why are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m17s)



[you not clipping oh do I have this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m21s)



[backwards](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m30s)



[to take a look okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m35s)



[losing faith in live sama let it and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m41s)



[continue snoop it is because snoop I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m43s)



[know so this is the one big advantage of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m48s)



[that I like of snoop over the wou win32](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h21m51s)



[exception okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m02s)



[I'm guessing snoop we had a little fight](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m06s)



[between the live sam'l edit continue and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m10s)



[snoop the the big advantage though that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m16s)



[I like over snoop is to a fault it will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m19s)



[try and let you modify absolutely](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m22s)



[anything whether it be properties on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m25s)



[your backing view models just randomly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m28s)



[invoking methods it'll it gives you a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m30s)



[lot of string to hang yourself and you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m34s)



[can use snoop to get your apps into very](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m36s)



[very broken states the ones that your](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m38s)



[users should never be able to get to but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m41s)



[at the same time it can be quite helpful](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m44s)



[in that it lets you modify stuff at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m46s)



[runtime and go through and do it so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m48s)



[that's the good where's the visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m50s)



[studio editor is a lot more restrictive](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m52s)



[and what it lets you edit and modify](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m54s)



[with that said the visual studio editor](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h22m58s)



[does have the advantage because it has](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m01s)



[the context of your source code it can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m02s)



[do things like click to show me where](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m05s)



[this style is declared in my source code](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m08s)



[and so it can help you navigate up those](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m10s)



[Styles a little bit easier so there's a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m12s)



[couple tasks that it does better than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m14s)



[snoop but for what I tend to do you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m16s)



[snoop for which is a lot of visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m20s)



[debugging of okay where did this why am](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m22s)



[I getting this color where did this come](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m25s)



[from why is this property not being set](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m27s)



[or in this case why is my ripple not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m29s)



[properly being clipped in those cases I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m30s)



[I find snoop is just so much easier to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m35s)



[work with over the visual studio one but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m38s)



[it also could be my bias I have also](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m42s)



[spent a lot a lot more years with snoop](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m45s)



[in the visual studio one okay so snoop](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m48s)



[binoculars target our window and then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m51s)



[we'll navigate okay don't worry about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m54s)



[the blue let's just verify we're still](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h23m59s)



[broken yeah and then the big secret was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m00s)



[snoop is you put your mouse over the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m04s)



[control you want and hold control shift](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m05s)



[and it automatically searches and finds](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m07s)



[the control inside of the visual tree](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m12s)



[it's worth noting it tends to find the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m14s)



[innermost control that it can hit test](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m17s)



[inside of the visual tree whereas like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m19s)



[the visual studio one typically uses the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m22s)



[logical tree and would like stop at the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m24s)



[button which is more often what you want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m26s)



[so this is our ripple this is our border](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m30s)



[this is where we automatically set our](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m35s)



[blue so let's just turn that off for a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m39s)



[minute and this border should have a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m40s)



[corner radius set on it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m45s)



[corner radius 25 25 25 which should be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m48s)



[clipping but it's clearly not clipped](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h24m57s)



[two bounds is true what the heck okay so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m02s)



[inside of my grid I have a canvas inside](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m11s)



[of my canvas I have an ellipse which is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m15s)



[not visible](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m17s)



[there's my canvas there height width and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m19s)



[then the content presenter is the stuff](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m24s)



[actually inside of this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m26s)



[the ripple is there let's jump back here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m35s)



[real quick to this button so this is the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m40s)



[background of the button I got the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m43s)



[corner radius applied so effectively](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m46s)



[we've got a so we can ignore the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m50s)



[progress bar for the moment because this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m52s)



[is just for the progress button stuff in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m54s)



[fact we can self close that tag so the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h25m57s)



[progress bar or both of these are](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m00s)



[sitting in an adorned or decorator so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m03s)



[they're sitting in at the adorne or](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m06s)



[level there's a grid whose only purpose](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m07s)



[is because we have multiple children and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m11s)



[one needs to sit on top of the other a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m14s)



[border with the background of the button](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m18s)



[that's getting applied and it gets a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m20s)



[corner radius and what not applied but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m23s)



[the key part is the content for the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m26s)



[button isn't directly inside of this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m28s)



[border it's over here and the content](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m30s)



[for the button sits inside of the ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m34s)



[and the ripple is where our problem is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m35s)



[because this guy will just turn this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m39s)



[off hopefully it doesn't break snoop all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m43s)



[all over the place yeah](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m46s)



[edit and reload caused all the content](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m53s)



[to die but that's fine I am clip two](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h26m55s)



[bounds is set to true on the ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m03s)



[why are you why is that not being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m10s)



[clipped I am actually baffled on this as](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m16s)



[to why this guy is not properly clipping](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m22s)



[because in general that is exactly what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m25s)



[clips to bounds should do maybe I am](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m28s)



[missing something obvious here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m36s)



[because normally so because you there's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m47s)



[other fun tricks that you can do with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m50s)



[like oh oh is that the problem does it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h27m51s)



[need to be masked off so there's another](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m00s)



[property on here that's common with like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m02s)



[a pasty mess let's take a quick look](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m06s)



[over at the color zone I think is also](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m09s)



[in generic because there is a feature I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m13s)



[put on the color zone a while back where](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m17s)



[you could control the which sides of it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m21s)



[the shadow appeared on and it does it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m24s)



[using the same sort of trick where it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m27s)



[clips off the shadow at the sides where](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m34s)



[it doesn't want it on there so clips to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m37s)



[bounds true](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m40s)



[let's see grid opacity mask shadow edge](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m42s)



[converter and interesting so let me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m48s)



[remind myself how this actually works](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m56s)



[because I don't actually remember so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h28m59s)



[pulls the thing through verifies the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m02s)



[values are the types expected verifies](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m05s)



[we don't have Nan's or infinities grabs](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m08s)



[the drop shadow and builds a rectangular](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m11s)



[based upon it and then does a drawing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m15s)



[brush with white aka turn all the bits](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m22s)



[on because no pasty mask is a bitwise](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m27s)



[and of the pixels and so this just draws](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m31s)



[through putting white everywhere so show](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m35s)



[all of these pixels but it also](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m39s)



[effectively can clip off other elements](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m40s)



[so I'm wondering if that's the thing is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m45s)



[border clip two bounds doesn't work the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m48s)



[way I expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m51s)



[okay when in doubt Google with being WPF](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h29m56s)



[border clip two bounds corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m03s)



[I am not the first one to run into this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m10s)



[canvas does not clip its children so you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m19s)



[so you are correct it is so there there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m24s)



[is a canvas at play in here tied its](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m27s)



[specifically inside of this ripple so we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m30s)



[have a border here and then the ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m33s)



[whose visual template gets applied which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m36s)



[is this guy up here so we technically](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m39s)



[have a border inside of a grid and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m44s)



[inside of the grid we then have a canvas](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m46s)



[and the ellipse is what's at is the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m49s)



[actual ripple effect that gets animated](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m52s)



[in and out which is the effectively the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h30m55s)



[problem that we're dealing with so I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m03s)



[agree that a canvas wouldn't clip its](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m09s)



[children but I thought I could clip a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m12s)



[canvas if that makes sense but maybe](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m14s)



[maybe I am wrong on that this just not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m21s)



[look easy rounded corners for anything](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m32s)



[this sounds more like what I want I want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m35s)



[rounded corners on my ripple let's see](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m38s)



[what this stack overflow indicates oh](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m44s)



[boy clipped abounds is for Oh got it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h31m48s)



[so that is my flaw so clip the bounds is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m01s)



[for layout which means I should probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m04s)



[look up the docs on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m07s)



[so this is effectively the same problem](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m13s)



[and so this one went down the opacity](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m19s)



[mask approach dang it okay okay fine we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m23s)



[can go down that path the yuk yuk yuk](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m34s)



[yuk okay well it's probably the better](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m39s)



[solution because then I don't need to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m43s)



[deal with moving these properties around](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m44s)



[okay let's go that route because that'll](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m49s)



[that'll surely at least work and so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h32m52s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m03s)



[a city mask so I don't think yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m04s)



[pretty sure so we basically need this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m17s)



[guy here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m20s)



[let's actually jump back here real quick](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m31s)



[how did he go about generating it hasty](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m33s)



[mass visual and he took a visual brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m38s)



[and passed in the element I don't like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m43s)



[doing that directly so the the problem](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m52s)



[with putting an element directly into a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m56s)



[visual brush is it will work right up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h33m58s)



[until you have something like a moving](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m00s)



[progress bar and then you'll start to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m03s)



[run into problems because I think what I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m07s)



[would rather do is just take the corner](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m12s)



[radiuses and draw an appropriate](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m21s)



[rectangle with them to clip by because I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m25s)



[don't necessarily want my pasty mass to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m32s)



[match that but the the problem being is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m34s)



[this mask like this guy here is going to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m38s)



[need to be a similar to this where we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m43s)



[end up needing to do a brush so either](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m48s)



[need to pass it a visual brush or a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m51s)



[drawing brush and do the drawing myself](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h34m56s)



[which one seems like less effort to me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m08s)



[because I think I think we just go with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m13s)



[multi binding and a converter do you get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m22s)



[the brush because again I don't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m25s)



[necessarily want to do a visual brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m28s)



[and just do something like pointed at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m32s)



[content because really I'd end up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m34s)



[needing to actually point it at this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m37s)



[border does that work not well because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m39s)



[if I pointed at the border and say](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m48s)



[somebody sets the background to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m50s)



[transparent then that fails I feel like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m51s)



[I want to control that Oh hold on hold](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h35m56s)



[on here we go here we go we can cheat so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m01s)



[a pasty mask visual brush visual brush](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m06s)



[what is it control visual and here let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m20s)



[go ahead and black you off we just bring](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m29s)



[in this guy and we put you in place](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m31s)



[there we change the wax the name of that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m41s)



[because that's not what we want we grabs](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m48s)



[that which will be fine we changed the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m51s)



[background to solid white because we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h36m56s)



[don't want too much we don't want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m00s)



[somebody just toggling the background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m03s)



[and causing their content to disappear](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m05s)



[because of this mask we will let that go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m06s)



[through template binding the border](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m10s)



[thickness is fine border effect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m12s)



[and I think that works](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m17s)



[let's run it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m27s)



[I'm also tempted to go through and only](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m29s)



[conditionally apply this mask if there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m37s)



[is a corner radius set so I think corner](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m40s)



[radius has like an is empty property on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m47s)



[it I mean we could do it we could do it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m50s)



[is empty converter so I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m54s)



[it matters that we're just blindly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h37m59s)



[applying this in all cases top left top](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m02s)



[right bottom oh there is one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m06s)



[it's just internal not helpful not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m09s)



[helpful at all but I believe this will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m14s)



[work and fix this corner radius problem](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m18s)



[it is interesting I guess I never have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m27s)



[used clip to bounds outside of a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m30s)



[rectangle before because what you can do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m33s)



[in a lot of cases with your controls is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m36s)



[to kind of get like an overhang effect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m39s)



[you can do negative margins so you can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m42s)



[actually rather than wear a margin](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m46s)



[pushes it in typically you can set a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m48s)



[negative one to let it go outside and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m50s)



[float and usually you end up setting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m52s)



[setting clip to bounds to false in most](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m56s)



[cases to let something go outside](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h38m58s)



[because a lot of controls or styles will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m00s)



[default to clipping which makes sense](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m04s)



[because most of the time you don't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m08s)



[explore where you've set its size to be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m10s)



[a hundred by a hundred you don't expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m13s)



[the children to exceed that size](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m15s)



[oh that's not right that is really fun](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m25s)



[though that's when a no pasty mass does](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m38s)



[to you what did I do](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m45s)



[so let's see this Oh pasty mask it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m53s)



[getting applied boy that's exactly right](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h39m57s)



[tight hole okay so the opacity mask gets](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m09s)



[applied it picks up a visual these ones](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m14s)



[shouldn't be making an if oh I bet you I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m19s)



[know what's happening so it's getting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m24s)



[the corner radius specified but this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m27s)



[visual inside of the visual brush isn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m29s)



[actually part of the tree so it's not so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m32s)



[if we were to open this guy up in snoop](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m35s)



[he would not show up as part of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m37s)



[visual tree so what's happening and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m39s)



[again I think is the only reason we show](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m42s)



[a size is because this corner radius so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m46s)



[the ones without a corner radius oh](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m48s)



[there's still a little bit they're](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m51s)



[almost shocked at that but I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m53s)



[the issue is this guy size has](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m55s)



[absolutely no he has no content or](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h40m59s)



[relative parents to figure it out so he](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m02s)



[just has to render which is problematic](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m04s)



[so I think what we want to do is let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m09s)



[do width and I don't know if I can get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m17s)



[away with this but we're going to try it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m20s)



[anyway element named boarder actual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m21s)

[height so the subtle difference between](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m46s)



[the width and height properties and the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m49s)



[actual width and actual height these](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m51s)



[properties are the request of what size](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m55s)



[it wants to go to and these are the ones](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h41m57s)



[that actually got set after the control](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m00s)



[was laid out and measured so hopefully](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m02s)



[this now sizes our border because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m10s)



[ultimately I want the border inside of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m15s)



[this mask to exactly match the size and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m17s)



[position of this border that's the goal](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m20s)



[I'm also realizing this guy has padding](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m27s)



[applied to him and this guy doesn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m31s)



[that's probably fine because the padding](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m37s)



[would apply to the content then why not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m38s)



[just go so the risk that that I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m41s)



[worried about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m45s)



[by binding it directly to the the my](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m46s)



[border or this border control up here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m51s)



[tied is in the event that somebody sets](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m53s)



[the background color to transparent or](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h42m57s)



[black right now if you do that and you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m00s)



[set the background color to black that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m04s)



[will it works you get a black button](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m07s)



[with some content on it but if you were](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m10s)



[to set the opacity mask does something](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m12s)



[that's black that effectively](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m14s)



[deletes the the those color bits which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m17s)



[white says turn all of the bits on black](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m22s)



[says turn all of it off so if somebody](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m25s)



[were to change this background color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m27s)



[they could cause their button to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m28s)



[disappear simply by changing this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m30s)



[background and that's the only thing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m33s)



[that's making making me a little weary](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m34s)



[about it is that that seems very](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m37s)



[counterintuitive specifically because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m39s)



[this border and the content of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m41s)



[border are not directly related to each](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m43s)



[other](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m47s)



[this guy just happens to sit on top yeah](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m48s)



[it's kind of a weird layout I mean I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m52s)



[understand why it's there it's because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m55s)



[we've got all these fancy buttons but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h43m57s)



[hey look at that no no no no oh but that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m01s)



[that what's that some what makes sense](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m13s)



[because I've now done the exact same](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m17s)



[thing wait a minute](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m20s)



[I'm confused this border should have a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m26s)



[corner radius and the color should not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m29s)



[go outside of it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m32s)



[so what just happened okay back to the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m34s)



[snoop who system cannot find the file](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m39s)



[specified there is something weird going](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m46s)



[on here I did recently take a visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m50s)



[studio update and I wonder if something](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m54s)



[changed or maybe I need to update snoop](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m56s)



[I don't remember the last version I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h44m59s)



[pulled it could be rather old I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m01s)



[this is probably at least the right path](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m06s)



[with this mask on here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m09s)



[it does make this a little more](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m13s)



[difficult to debug](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m15s)



[so where why if you have a corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m21s)



[you should be rendering well okay so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m28s)



[still buggy right yeah okay dive me in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m32s)



[so on this ripple let's look at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m38s)



[so next snoop tip this window up here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m43s)



[lets you just search for stuff which is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m46s)



[awesome so that that is what get off](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h45m49s)



[there](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m00s)



[I mean that's what I would expect a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m09s)



[rounded corner with white](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m14s)



[interesting what happens](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m24s)



[they wanted to continue did not find](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m35s)



[anything to edit because if that what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m37s)



[would do this what would do this to me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h46m47s)



[because the alternative is rather than](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m01s)



[going with a border we go back with like](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m05s)



[a a rectangle the only issue with just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m09s)



[doing a rectangle rather than a border](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m16s)



[is then we have to also account for the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m18s)



[size of the border thickness in addition](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m20s)



[to just the size of the border itself we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m23s)



[don't want to accidentally clip off](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m27s)



[something though we're only looking to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m28s)



[clip the inner content I guess in that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m36s)



[case we really don't care I'm okay if I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m42s)



[clip the ripple as soon as it hits the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m45s)



[border pen or the border brush that's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m47s)



[going around the outside edge that way](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m49s)



[it looks as though the edge is what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m52s)



[actually Clips it off which probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m54s)



[makes sense because if you set a border](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h47m58s)



[thickness with a border brush I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m00s)



[having the ripple stopped when it hits](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m03s)



[that border is probably expected or at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m05s)



[least it's not counterintuitive](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m10s)



[did absolutely nothing which instantly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m24s)



[makes me skeptical](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m31s)



[so when we bound this guy let's oh hang](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m44s)



[on this screams of some sort of binding](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m47s)



[failure a system data error object](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m50s)



[source cannot converse null really](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m54s)



[should deal with those no binding](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h48m58s)



[failures on any of these why why would](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m03s)



[that not pull through okay once again](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m15s)



[back to the snoop](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m22s)



[let's go and look at this guy again](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m23s)



[because this should be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m25s)



[let's go back so this guy suggested](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m35s)



[rounding match stretches to feel grid](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m41s)



[background:white corner radius 7 and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m55s)



[uses that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h49m59s)



[then Eclipse so this is the stack panel](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m12s)



[and any Content yeah](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m18s)



[so effectively just loads this over the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m36s)



[top of his other grid](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m39s)



[okay this feeling like I'm not getting](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m51s)



[anything more useful out of that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h50m57s)



[okay so let's back this guy up go take a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m00s)



[look at his mask yeah rendering pretty](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m03s)



[much exactly as it would expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m10s)



[show me your width and heights](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m16s)



[oh I'm inside the brush I need to look](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m21s)



[at the brushes visual so look it here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m28s)



[actual height actual width that all got](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m33s)



[rendered correctly did you pick up a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m39s)



[corner radius yeah so let's go down here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m44s)



[and change out well let's just play with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h51m55s)



[the width I guess just make sure this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m03s)



[guy is actually working the way I think](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m07s)



[he's working okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m09s)



[too much scrolling width so from 124 be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m11s)



[50 so now if I click I expect my ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m17s)



[to stop about halfway it's not stopping](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m25s)



[at all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m30s)



[so this pasty mask applied directly to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m32s)



[the ripple it's not doing what I expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m37s)



[and I bet you I know why so even though](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m48s)



[we apply it to the ripple itself that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m53s)



[doesn't mean that it's actually used in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m57s)



[the controls template yep](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h52m59s)



[so just because a property exists](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m13s)



[doesn't mean it's actually used and in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m16s)



[our case we expect it to be applied to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m22s)



[the grid yep](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m24s)



[what do you bet that I don't trust you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m30s)



[right now relaunch let's try this one](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m35s)



[more time because I'm I'm willing to bet](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m39s)



[that that was the the problem is even](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m40s)



[though we set it on this control if it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m43s)



[not used nothing recognises it the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m47s)



[template doesn't use it and the property](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m53s)



[is effectively meaningless so we should](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m55s)



[bring it forward this is a common](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h53m58s)



[problem when we templating controls is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m00s)



[if you don't template bind all the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m02s)



[properties somebody may set one of the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m05s)



[properties and then get very confused](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m07s)



[like myself as to why the setting the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m09s)



[property seems to have no effect then](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m14s)



[the answer it gets dropped so I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m16s)



[willing to bet if we were to look down a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m18s)



[level we wouldn't see anything happening](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m20s)



[this is also a reason why typically when](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m26s)



[the easiest way to modify a control is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m29s)



[to set like the data templates that way](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m32s)



[you're mucking with the content and not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m34s)



[to control itself but in our case with a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m36s)



[theme library it gets a little more](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m40s)



[complex](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m42s)



[let's see if this doesn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m48s)



[as we could always wrap this wrap the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h54m59s)



[ripple in something to get the behavior](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m02s)



[but no point in adding to the visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m04s)



[tree if we don't have to especially](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m06s)



[since we control the ripple we can fix](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m08s)



[it okay so please work no no no no](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m10s)



[if it's left](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h55m40s)



[this unfortunately looks very similar I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m04s)



[really don't want to have to do some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m12s)



[sort of custom custom rendering and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m14s)



[measuring stuff that really doesn't feel](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m20s)



[like what I want](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m23s)



[that kind of what are you want no way](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m38s)



[you have to put padding and margin](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m43s)



[around it but Oh yuck](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m45s)



[so canvas inside of a border same](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m50s)



[technique and just left up one it does](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h56m54s)



[not look like I am wondering if you're](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m12s)



[right tight about the canvas being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m19s)



[problematic I just really really really](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m23s)



[don't like these options just having to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m28s)



[effectively manually do your clip we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m34s)



[could do the clip directly rather than a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m43s)



[mask I wonder if that would be a cleaner](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m45s)



[approach](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h57m51s)



[let's try](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m05s)



[let's give this a try so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m15s)



[oh let's put this back to white real](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m25s)



[quick before I get too carried away](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m27s)



[let's just try this one more time](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m29s)



[because I do expect this to work does](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m31s)



[beg the question this is white and the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m41s)



[background is transferred or the outer](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m46s)



[areas transparent if that doesn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m49s)



[effectively clip I got one more thought](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m53s)



[on this visual if this doesn't work I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h58m59s)



[may put this inside of a grid because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m02s)



[I'm wondering so this border when it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m09s)



[draws effectively draws a rounded](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m12s)



[cornered border but then the question is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m15s)



[if you look at the rectangle of that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m20s)



[border what's outside of the white and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m21s)



[the answer is it's unset so it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m24s)



[effectively draws transparent and I'm](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m26s)



[wondering if it draws effectively the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m28s)



[hex value zero zero ffffff because if](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m33s)



[that's the case and the opacity mask](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m40s)



[doesn't take alpha into consideration](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m44s)



[which it would given that we're trying](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m47s)



[to do opacity it would not shock me that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m49s)



[it would remove those and just do the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m52s)



[bitwise and across the board then that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=01h59m54s)



[would block it out so my thought is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m01s)



[effectively to put this border inside of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m03s)



[another border and have its background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m07s)



[be black that way we have black around](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m09s)



[the outside of a white and use that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m13s)



[effectively to clip it so if this fails](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m15s)



[we might try that first before we go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m20s)



[carried away too much on the clip so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m23s)



[yeah that doesn't play nice with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m26s)



[other children](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m28s)



[so border background](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m28s)



[black I wonder if that's what's causing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m36s)



[the problem to do and you go there I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m39s)



[trust you I trust you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m47s)



[nope still gonna relaunch you because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m50s)



[this puts you over the top](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h00m59s)



[because this should limit the size to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m12s)



[exactly match this one yeah and we saw](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m16s)



[that the bindings on all of these went](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m24s)



[through and worked because when we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m26s)



[examined this border we saw that the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m29s)



[width and height of it were set](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m31s)



[appropriately and the corner radius was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m34s)



[set appropriately so everything is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m35s)



[flowing correctly it is just not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m40s)



[properly clipping that ripple like I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m43s)



[would expect and we did modify this so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m45s)



[that the Oh pasty mass does convert all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m52s)



[the way down I'm wondering as we want it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h01m56s)



[to ultimately get applied to this canvas](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m07s)



[so I think applying it to this grid is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m09s)



[correct](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m11s)



[I am wondering ripple assist click to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m14s)



[bounce oh oh don't tell me](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m21s)



[don't tell me that would be propagating](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m32s)



[all the way down my double check that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m35s)



[just to make darn sure I forgot about](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m40s)



[that property let's just come up here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h02m49s)



[bowl assists clip the bounds true turn](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m01s)



[that on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m10s)



[okay Snoop come save me I am lost and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m16s)



[confused Wow](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m22s)



[this keeps happening I might have to dig](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m28s)



[into why Snoop is ultimately failing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m31s)



[because this seems off](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m33s)



[so what do we got going on so on our](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m42s)



[pasty mask have a border its inner](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m44s)



[border or I should say the outer border](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m51s)



[is black so we've got a black rectangle](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m54s)



[its inner border is white its size to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h03m56s)



[match the background border of our](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m01s)



[buttons so its width and height will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m04s)



[match and it's corner radius will match](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m05s)



[great same with the border thickness and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m08s)



[border brush but both of these are unset](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m11s)



[right now same with our effect we aren't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m13s)



[setting a shadow depth or at least we're](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m16s)



[not setting one beyond the default which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m19s)



[is fine I guess we're technically Shetty](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m22s)



[setting a shadow depth of one this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m24s)



[should cause us to have effectively a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m31s)



[black rectangle with a white rectangle](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m33s)



[inside of it with rounded corners which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m36s)



[should be clipping the content this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m40s)



[custom ripple control takes it in and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m44s)



[applies it at the parent grid the parent](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h04m55s)



[grid contains both the canvas and the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m01s)



[content the canvas sits below usually](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m04s)



[except for there I know there's a style](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m16s)

[either sits at 0 below the content](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m21s)



[presenter or sits at 2 to be on top of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m24s)



[the content presenter because we needed](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m27s)



[that for some of the honestly for the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m30s)



[demo app for the controls that we were](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m34s)



[using because the ripple was being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m36s)



[applied directly so let's take a look](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m38s)



[here where do you go](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m45s)



[still no dice still no dice what is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m52s)



[going on so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h05m57s)



[interesting okay so this guy here he's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m31s)



[not being clipped at all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m42s)



[why so this sets the property on the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m49s)



[clip two bounds here based upon that but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h06m58s)



[we're just gonna go a step a step lower](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m01s)



[and just hard coded here that doesn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m04s)



[end up causing all right layout not okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m14s)



[so let's go back and I think I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m23s)



[leave this fuchsia because that's a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m28s)



[whole lot that's a quicker test mmm good](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m31s)



[to know tied there's something I have to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m38s)



[believe there's something weird either](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m42s)



[like what you'd mentioned earlier with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m43s)



[the canvas not properly clipping its](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m45s)



[children or something with this control](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m48s)



[template where some of the default](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m53s)



[properties don't move all the way down I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m55s)



[did go through and add these template](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m57s)



[bindings I think I'm gonna attempt this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h07m59s)



[clip I I think that's where we're gonna](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m01s)



[go next and see what's going on because](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m05s)



[I don't think this so here's here's a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m09s)



[quick here's a quick test just to just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m16s)



[to test this guy out](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m18s)



[so rather than setting the ripple](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m20s)



[content presents re content control yeah](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m23s)



[and let's take a look at this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m35s)



[so this will remove the ripple but this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m46s)



[will at least let us test if the if the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m50s)



[issue with the opacity mask is with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m55s)



[mass that we've created or with the or](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h08m57s)



[if it's something with the ripple this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m01s)



[should at least narrow down where to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m05s)



[start the hunt and I'm technically 10](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m06s)



[minutes past when I normally stop but](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m12s)



[this is effectively nerd sniped me and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m15s)



[now I must know the answer and it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m18s)



[going to bother me in my sleep this is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m21s)



[the problem with good programming](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m28s)



[puzzles because I can't rest until I can](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m30s)



[actually explain it oh that doesn't](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m34s)



[remind me a couple streams back I showed](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m43s)



[a programming puzzle it was on one of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m45s)



[these system command line streams where](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m50s)



[I showed off a simple puzzle of given a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m52s)



[system type create an empty delegate for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m56s)



[it and somebody had pointed out that my](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h09m58s)



[solution appeared to have an air in it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m02s)



[which I agreed that it looked like it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m03s)



[was an error and then when I started to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m06s)



[dig into it more I found a unit test](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m08s)



[that actually covered the case in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m11s)



[question and ultimately I ended up](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m12s)



[realizing that my code works due to a an](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m16s)



[a an accidental issue in the runtime so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m20s)



[in the runtime null is defined to be the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m26s)



[bit pattern of all zeros and so that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m28s)



[ultimately Oh interesting so that okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m33s)



[so that worked did that work](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m44s)



[I don't know if I can say that that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m49s)



[worked here's what we can do we can turn](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h10m55s)



[off this corner radius](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m05s)



[yes we turn off that corner radius try](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m18s)



[it one more time](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m23s)



[so in the run time null is I agree tied](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m24s)



[in the run time Knoll is defined to be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m30s)



[the bit pattern of all zeros and so in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m32s)



[the the brain teaser puzzle that I put](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m35s)



[out to return null from a reference type](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m38s)



[I was just emitting a 0 and it was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m42s)



[working and I didn't fully understand](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m46s)



[why omitting a 0 return null but it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m47s)



[turns out when you're working at the IL](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m51s)



[level if you have a reference type and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m53s)



[you emit a zero it is the runtime treats](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h11m56s)



[null as all zeros so it works I did not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m00s)



[know that when I wrote the code but it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m03s)



[was a nice accident to stumble into so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m05s)



[rather than fixing any problems I just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m10s)



[documented the code for anyone else who](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m12s)



[wanted to come across it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m15s)



[yeah and if we don't solve this tonight](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m23s)



[I'm probably gonna end up waking up in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m26s)



[the morning with a solution or worse](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m28s)



[waking up at about 3 or 4 a.m. with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m29s)



[answer and having to get out of bed and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m32s)



[go to my computer and type it out that's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m33s)



[usually how it goes much to the dismay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m37s)



[of my wife she doesn't understand how I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m42s)



[can fall asleep and then find a solution](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m45s)



[to a problem and I've learned my lesson](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m48s)



[if I don't if I wake up with the answer](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h12m58s)



[I need to go write it down immediately](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m00s)



[otherwise by the time I wake up in the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m02s)

[nothing left glad to know I'm not alone](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m08s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m16s)



[that makes me feel slightly better and a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m19s)



[little bit worse so I still have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m25s)



[magnifier opens what is it no windows](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m29s)



[plus so because we're applying a no](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m33s)



[pasty mass to this guy and we would have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m42s)



[expected the corner radius to trim it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m45s)



[the issue is with our mask not with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m48s)



[ripple because I would have expected to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m53s)



[see a corner trimmed right here with the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h13m58s)



[2550 radius and it's not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m02s)



[so that that makes me feel mildly better](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m12s)



[knowing that it is a meant ID that makes](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m18s)



[me feel mildly better knowing that it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m26s)



[not something broken in the ripple and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m28s)



[it is just broken with my usage of this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m30s)



[Oh pasty mask and the visual brush so](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m35s)



[that bothers me a great deal that this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m44s)



[is not working the way I expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m47s)



[so let's do let's do this it's not a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h14m56s)



[it's not a great test but let's move](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m05s)



[this content out of here and slap you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m07s)



[directly in all right let's just make](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m13s)



[darn sure that this is actually yeah I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m19s)



[don't quite trust you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m23s)



[let's relaunch let's just make sure that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m25s)



[this actually works the way that I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m28s)



[expect so now inside of every button I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m33s)



[expect to see this black and white](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m39s)



[layout so no corner radius anywhere](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m44s)



[except this white rectangle on the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m52s)



[inside with a black one around the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m54s)



[outside why do you not properly trim](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h15m57s)



[yourself what would make this mask not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m05s)



[work because we know this technique is](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m12s)



[exactly what we've done before except](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m16s)



[for we use the dry and brush here with a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m18s)



[very particular size and in this case](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m22s)



[it's drawing a straight rectangle rather](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m30s)



[than doing these sort of fancy curvature](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m32s)



[corner rectangles only because this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m35s)



[rectangle is being drawn to account for](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m38s)



[where that shadow would appear but it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m42s)



[being drawn to clip the shadow off of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m46s)



[particular edges because normally if you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m48s)



[just do the drop shadow effect on things](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m49s)



[it comes off on potentially two sides](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m53s)



[ish one side ish depending on the angle](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h16m57s)



[that you set and that's not always](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m00s)



[desirable especially with like a color](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m04s)



[zone where you may just want the shadow](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m06s)



[along one edge](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m08s)



[so this lets you clip it yeah agreed](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m09s)



[that that element name I would have](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m20s)



[expected to be effectively the same](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m23s)



[thing okay so this so this is what's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m24s)



[baffling to me is this is exactly what I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m33s)



[would expect I would expect black](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m38s)



[rectangle white around the edge which](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m43s)



[should clip what the heck what the heck](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m49s)



[is going on here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h17m57s)



[okay so something is not going the way I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m10s)



[expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m16s)



[so let's let's change this up then let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m26s)



[let's make this stupid simple so rather](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m29s)



[than actually taking in content the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m32s)



[content of all buttons shall simply be](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m35s)



[the border of blue right and so this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m38s)



[thing effectively because we know it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m48s)



[renders correctly you know it draws](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m52s)



[correctly](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h18m54s)



[what am I doing wrong](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m03s)



[this should bring in so I would expect](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m13s)



[to get the the blue rectangle now](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m19s)



[effectively with this applying the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m21s)



[rounded corners to it I'm missing](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m24s)



[something stupid on visual brush its](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m31s)



[value this specifies whether this visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m39s)



[brush will run loud and and it's visual](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m41s)



[I said defaulting to false because the](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m51s)



[part that bothers me is if this was](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h19m59s)



[really failing to lay out these borders](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m03s)



[inside of it I would have sort of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m08s)



[expected that to result in no content](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m11s)



[being displayed not all content and it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m13s)



[clearly showing all content okay let's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m21s)



[take a look at this guy](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m27s)



[quite literally nothing being applied it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m38s)



[is worth noting that there is some](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m44s)



[amount of padding that's clearly being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m46s)



[set here](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m48s)



[I'm guessing this thing must have a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m49s)



[default padding of something 16 4 16 4](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m51s)



[that doesn't visually line up with what](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h20m59s)



[I expect but I'm not horribly concerned](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m02s)



[with tracking that down at the moment](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m05s)



[because for all I know that's being](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m08s)



[overridden in a drive style](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m10s)



[interesting interesting interesting well](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m23s)



[unfortunately if we don't solve this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m29s)



[here in the next few minutes I may just](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m31s)



[have to go to bed and have a pen and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m33s)



[paper but if somebody wants to solve it](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m36s)



[for me I would not be opposed to a good](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m40s)



[pole request because I'm starting to](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m42s)



[wonder if the problem is that just that](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m48s)



[I am too tired and can't think straight](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m49s)



[which is a very real possibility right](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m52s)



[now so let's see mask oh wait a minute](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h21m55s)



[nevermind that shouldn't be applied](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m04s)



[there I'm at the wrong level see I'm at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m05s)



[the wrong so the mask](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m09s)



[clip](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m23s)



[I think you tied yeah I'm I'm about at](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m32s)



[my wit's end on this one but I'm it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m35s)



[going to bother me especially since this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m38s)



[is the last issue remaining so I I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m40s)



[really want to get this fixed before we](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m46s)



[kick to 600 out the door so I think with](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m48s)



[that I might have to sign off for now I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m51s)



[am planning on streaming again at this](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m55s)



[time next week so if this works for you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h22m57s)



[if it's not too late I'll probably be on](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m01s)



[again then there's also a chance I may](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m03s)



[do another impromptu stream either later](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m07s)



[this week maybe next week there's a](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m10s)



[system command line issue that's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m12s)



[plaguing me that I want to actually get](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m14s)



[resolved so if people are interested in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m17s)



[the system command line library and](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m21s)



[working on a bug there I will probably](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m23s)



[be attacking that and figured I would](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m26s)



[live streaming it's going to be a lot of](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m27s)



[creating synchronous overloads for async](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m30s)



[methods and how to not shoot yourself in](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m33s)



[the foot while doing it so it's not](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m35s)



[exactly a trivial thing and normally you](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m38s)



[shouldn't ever do it but in our case](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m40s)



[it's kind of required so with that I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m44s)



[will say good night thanks for hanging](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m48s)



[out tight as always it's been a it's](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m50s)



[been fun and glad that we made progress](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m52s)



[and hopefully it's one last item I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m55s)



[thought it was going to be simple I](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h23m58s)



[thought we were going to knock it all](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m00s)



[off tonight but apparently we will we'll](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m01s)



[do it again later so with that I will](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m05s)



[say good night and happy coding](https://youtu.be/CfmbYPdTlUI?t=02h24m07s)
