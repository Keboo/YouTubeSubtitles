[00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,119](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h01m59s)

you


[00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h30m47s)

actually it looks like I'm gonna have to


[00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:55,059](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h30m50s)

run and go grab my spare batteries that


[00:30:53,740 --> 00:31:05,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h30m53s)

I thought we're good or apparently not


[00:30:55,059 --> 00:31:09,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h30m55s)

good so so if you guys can hold on one


[00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h31m05s)

moment I will be back momentarily


[00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h31m16s)

you


[00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:35,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m28s)

okay test test test there we are


[00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:38,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m31s)

okay back to where we were so this guy


[00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m35s)

was calling out specifically this ripple


[00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:49,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m38s)

this reference count is what's most


[00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:52,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m41s)

interesting to me and this guy down here


[00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,360](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m49s)

well so two paths forward and I think


[00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:58,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m52s)

the first one we're going to do is


[00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m55s)

probably the easiest so stars are going


[00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h32m58s)

to jump back to the root of the repo and


[00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:07,240](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m00s)

then I'm going to take a quick look at


[00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:08,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m02s)

the the two five one release because


[00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m07s)

that was where this bug was reported I


[00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:15,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m08s)

have a sinking suspicion that this may


[00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m12s)

have been fixed already so we're just


[00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m15s)

going to download the two five one


[00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:24,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m16s)

release and see if we can reproduce this


[00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:25,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m20s)

memory memory leak here if it reproduces


[00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m24s)

in two five one and I can't do it in the


[00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m25s)

two 600 with my latest code then I am


[00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m28s)

not that concerned about it and I will


[00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:37,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m31s)

just write it off as fixed in two six


[00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m33s)

zero and I'm probably willing to post a


[00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:42,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m37s)

question asking for a little bit more


[00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m38s)

information on how to use dot peek since


[00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m42s)

this is an or not peak memory since this


[00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,720](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m45s)

is not my area of expertise I said I'm a


[00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m48s)

little more familiar with the visual


[00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:57,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m49s)

studio tools and that's the other option


[00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:59,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m51s)

is taking a quick look at this from that


[00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m57s)

perspective because it's very possible


[00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:07,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h33m59s)

that fire up the tools I'm a little more


[00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:13,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m02s)

familiar with and let's just put you on


[00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:18,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m07s)

the desktop and we will go and grab you


[00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:29,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m13s)

real quick so browse into that guy and


[00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:32,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m18s)

let's see desktop demo bin and open okay


[00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:33,610](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m29s)

let's see if we can reproduce this now


[00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m32s)

because this would be the most


[00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:39,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m33s)

convenient if if this memory issue would


[00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m36s)

reproduce here


[00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,599](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h34m44s)

okay fire up and away we go


[00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m03s)

who


[00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,580](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m09s)

there have been quite a few changes


[00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m12s)

around here so let's go over to the


[00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m13s)

buttons and toggles page is that


[00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m16s)

something else that that ended up


[00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m17s)

happening it's a little different in the


[00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:23,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m19s)

latest two 6o stuff is this buttons and


[00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:29,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m21s)

toggle page got broken apart into


[00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:34,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m23s)

several other pages whoo baby that's


[00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:37,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m29s)

slow once again we're gonna give this


[00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:46,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m34s)

guy just a moment to somewhat stabilized


[00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:48,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m37s)

and then we will grab our snapshot okay


[00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:55,160](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m46s)

I think that's probably good for


[00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:59,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m48s)

snapshot one let's see where that guy


[00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h35m55s)

lands okay so


[00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:15,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m04s)

at a moment okay and then let's just


[00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:18,440](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m07s)

start clicking through these buttons you


[00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,440](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m15s)

just got a little bigger


[00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:41,799](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m33s)

okay take a second snapshot and let's


[00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m39s)

see if we come up with because ideally I


[00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m41s)

want to find something that shows me


[00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m46s)

that ripple count getting bigger like


[00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h36m50s)

the bug reported


[00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m04s)

does appear I'm wondering if maybe part


[00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m07s)

of my issue before was I click this


[00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:14,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m08s)

collect allocations because it appears


[00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m11s)

that that may just toggle this


[00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m14s)

allocation collection bits down here


[00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:23,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m17s)

fact once it's done processing the


[00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:25,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m19s)

snapshot we might just so when you click


[00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m23s)

that it turns off allocation class haha


[00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m25s)

so that's what that is


[00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m26s)

it's literally just a setting for


[00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m28s)

whether you should collect those objects


[00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:47,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m30s)

and I got it got it got it I'm learning


[00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:47,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m34s)

as we go see here so again


[00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:10,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m55s)

this is a little bit nicer if we group


[00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:13,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h37m57s)

by namespace shadow local info but in


[00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m10s)

this case


[00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m18s)

in this case I'm not seeing new objects


[00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m20s)

being allocated


[00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:35,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m26s)

unless there's I am not seeing a


[00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:46,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m36s)

namespace assembly interface well the


[00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:49,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m42s)

the problem that I see here is that


[00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:59,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m46s)

let's turn off the grouping and just go


[00:38:49,290 --> 00:39:03,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m49s)

back to the new objects so no way to


[00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h38m59s)

turn off the grouping plane list there


[00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m03s)

we are


[00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:11,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m03s)

I will say I am NOT a big fan of this


[00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:17,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m06s)

interface this does not scream


[00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:20,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m11s)

friendliness to me but what do I know


[00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:22,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m17s)

let's see so automation peers this looks


[00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m20s)

very similar to what we saw before


[00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m22s)

storyboard


[00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:37,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m30s)

I would you Delta this is that same


[00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:57,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m44s)

let's see yes same compiler generated


[00:39:48,930 --> 00:40:00,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m48s)

delegate okay so this is this is making


[00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h39m57s)

me feel a little better


[00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:14,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m02s)

haha we found it okay so that was my


[00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m10s)

problem is I turned off the collections


[00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:28,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m14s)

before doing it


[00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:31,490](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m16s)

okay so let's call tree this is not


[00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,490](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m28s)

looking promising


[00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:59,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m47s)

oh this it looks like we're getting


[00:40:49,340 --> 00:41:04,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m49s)

closer Ripple mouse button event handler


[00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:06,500](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h40m59s)

which that guy is clearly us and then


[00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:12,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m04s)

let's keep going a little deeper a


[00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:17,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m06s)

little deeper keep going Wow


[00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:23,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m12s)

I'm preview we've got at least one bit


[00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:26,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m17s)

there that's us just state manager you


[00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m23s)

go to state


[00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m33s)

okay


[00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:55,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m39s)

so let's go back because I am interested


[00:41:46,910 --> 00:42:08,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m46s)

in seeing and understanding this is true


[00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:11,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h41m55s)

and these are the new objects bothers me


[00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m08s)

a little bit


[00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:23,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m16s)

that a simple call like visual state


[00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:33,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m18s)

manager go to state is what's leaking


[00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:43,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m23s)

that feels like not the right issue okay


[00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:45,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m33s)

so let's go back up I'd be willing to


[00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:53,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m43s)

bet it's gonna be somewhere in this


[00:42:45,050 --> 00:43:03,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m45s)

vicinity because just allocating objects


[00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:04,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h42m53s)

itself isn't bad it'd only be if those


[00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m03s)

objects were not actually getting


[00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m04s)

reclaimed


[00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:35,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m28s)

because this is building up a property


[00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m32s)

path parameter collection this comes


[00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:40,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m35s)

from your bindings


[00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m37s)

let's see event handler store or not as


[00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:47,990](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m40s)

familiar with it


[00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:50,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m42s)

generic list let's just take a look at


[00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:55,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m47s)

these new instances and see what the


[00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m50s)

path is that they came from so I think


[00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:04,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h43m55s)

we showed instances is that magical bit


[00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:09,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m01s)

here and then double click on one of


[00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:13,940](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m04s)

these and this is pretty much


[00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:16,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m09s)

meaningless looks largely like an empty


[00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m13s)

list


[00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m27s)

observe book collection get path


[00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:37,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m29s)

parameters and these guys did get


[00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:43,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m32s)

allocated okay I does none of those


[00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:53,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m37s)

bother me let's step back here a little


[00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:57,099](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m43s)

bit and let's go too far too many bad


[00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:58,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m53s)

clicks let's actually just kill the app


[00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m57s)

for now because I think we've got all


[00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,599](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h44m58s)

the data we need let's go back down here


[00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,509](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m02s)

and take a look and see because I'm


[00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:11,349](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m04s)

really looking though to try and


[00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:13,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m07s)

understand if this storyboard is


[00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:15,999](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m11s)

probably one of the more route level


[00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:19,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m13s)

objects I'm guessing something is


[00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:24,039](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m15s)

starting a storyboard holding on to it


[00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:32,499](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m19s)

and not letting go so let's take a look


[00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:34,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m24s)

at the instances back traces storyboard


[00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:41,829](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m32s)

create instance core visual state


[00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:43,749](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m34s)

manager go to state or mouse button


[00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:45,099](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m41s)

event handler so let's let's just get


[00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:49,329](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m43s)

this code open and start looking at


[00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:51,609](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m45s)

what's actually in here because it seems


[00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:57,609](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m49s)

like according to this that the the


[00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:59,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m51s)

fundamental issue here so this is back


[00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:02,289](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m57s)

traces so this is going the opposite


[00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:05,289](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h45m59s)

direction so this is visual state


[00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:07,029](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m02s)

manager generate dynamic transition


[00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:08,829](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m05s)

which was called by a go to state


[00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:10,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m07s)

internal which was called by go to state


[00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:13,539](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m08s)

common which is called by go to state


[00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:17,319](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m10s)

which we ultimately called in ripple


[00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:22,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m13s)

mouse button event handler or ripple on


[00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:25,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m17s)

preview left mouse button down also the


[00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:25,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m22s)

same for a toggle button


[00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:35,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m27s)

and despite all of this I don't I don't


[00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:39,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m31s)

see anything that's likely to cause a


[00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:43,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m35s)

problem here and I'm hesitant to put in


[00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:47,049](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m39s)

memory fixes for something that doesn't


[00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,049](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m43s)

look like it may be a problem


[00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:03,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h46m58s)

so I may end up punting this guy a


[00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:08,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m00s)

little bit until we can get a little


[00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:12,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m03s)

better information because I don't


[00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:21,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m08s)

necessarily know if this is actually a


[00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:25,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m12s)

problem come on visual studio you can do


[00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:27,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m21s)

it you can do it once again my my


[00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m25s)

standard rubber duck debugging is to


[00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m27s)

talk to Visual Studio until it does what


[00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:35,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m29s)

I want it may not actually help anything


[00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m33s)

run faster but it certainly helps my own


[00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:45,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m35s)

sanity


[00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:47,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m36s)

so there's that also caffeine I am


[00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m45s)

convinced that the vast majority of


[00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:53,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m47s)

software developers have some form of


[00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:58,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m50s)

caffeine addiction whether it be coffee


[00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:59,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m53s)

soda or pop or tea most developers I


[00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:04,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m58s)

know have some form of a caffeine


[00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:07,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h47m59s)

addiction which leaves rise to the idea


[00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m04s)

that a software developer is just an


[00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m07s)

organism that converts caffeine into


[00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m09s)

code


[00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:29,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m21s)

so there are and most of the so the the


[00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:34,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m25s)

bug does link to I should say Steven


[00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:36,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m29s)

from Auckland did did link to this


[00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:39,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m34s)

article here which is rather helpful


[00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:41,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m36s)

except for in most of these cases and I


[00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m39s)

say most but I think in almost every


[00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:47,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m41s)

single one of these cases it's all


[00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:51,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m43s)

around leaking delegates so a delegate


[00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:55,059](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m47s)

in dotnet largely contains two things


[00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:59,079](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m51s)

the the sender object and then the


[00:48:55,059 --> 00:49:01,809](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m55s)

method info to invoke and the key here


[00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:03,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h48m59s)

is that in the latest versions of


[00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:05,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m01s)

c-sharp you used to have to declare your


[00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m03s)

event handlers like this where you were


[00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:14,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m05s)

very explicit you know event plus equals


[00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:16,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m08s)

new event delegate type and then method


[00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,839](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m14s)

to invoke which this subtly then


[00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:24,040](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m16s)

captured the instance that was in this


[00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:28,359](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m19s)

and stored it inside of this event


[00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:30,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m24s)

handler list which then could cause this


[00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:33,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m28s)

to hold on and keep a reference alive


[00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:35,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m30s)

and so the solution in almost all of


[00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:38,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m33s)

these is unbind them and in a lot of


[00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:43,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m35s)

these cases where there is these extra


[00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:49,359](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m38s)

bindings or similar all these are doing


[00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:51,579](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m43s)

is if usually implicit delegates so for


[00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:57,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m49s)

example the command binding this guy is


[00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:59,589](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m51s)

also capturing a delegate and so things


[00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,049](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m57s)

like this where it's where it's


[00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:03,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h49m59s)

registering up and capturing them and


[00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:07,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m02s)

it's not always clear that that's what's


[00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m03s)

happening and so in almost all of these


[00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,490](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m07s)

situations


[00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,609](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m08s)

the idea is to unregister now there's


[00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:22,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m12s)

some of these other ones with like


[00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:25,299](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m14s)

bitmap image in an image source but that


[00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:31,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m22s)

is not I mean that's not the problem


[00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:33,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m25s)

that we're running into here because


[00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m31s)

especially with something like the the


[00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m33s)

ripple


[00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m34s)

let's take a look at what's actually


[00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:45,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m35s)

going on here then so Ripple class


[00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:47,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m39s)

please come on Visual Studio I believe


[00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m45s)

in you


[00:50:53,890 --> 00:51:01,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m53s)

there you go Ripple so going back to our


[00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h50m59s)

dot memory what we're looking for is


[00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:12,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m01s)

maybe we'll just do this on preview


[00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:16,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m04s)

mouse left button down so on preview


[00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:20,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m12s)

Mouse loud hey I know that's I know you


[00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:26,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m16s)

really want to be there but let's go


[00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:28,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m20s)

here so let's take a look so ultimately


[00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:34,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m26s)

what's happening is this guy is calling


[00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:34,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m28s)

in to go to state which is passing in


[00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:42,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m36s)

calling go to state go to state all the


[00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:47,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m38s)

way through and it is passing in one of


[00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:52,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m42s)

these guys the problem being and I what


[00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m47s)

I suspected was this pressed instances


[00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:03,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h51m53s)

was getting an item added to it and I


[00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m00s)

assumed because this is a static


[00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:11,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m03s)

collection which means it will keep an


[00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:15,610](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m06s)

object alive and I had assumed that that


[00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:17,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m11s)

was the source of the problem because


[00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m15s)

you'll notice on preview left mouse


[00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:24,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m17s)

button down let's look at the other


[00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:28,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m18s)

culprit mouse button event handler I


[00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:34,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m24s)

know I saw that guy here mouse button


[00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:38,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m28s)

event handler it's interesting that this


[00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:40,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m34s)

one shows up because it also has a go to


[00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m38s)

state but this pressed instances is


[00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m40s)

being cleared so the commonality is


[00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m41s)

these two so let's look at what's


[00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:49,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m43s)

happening inside of this visual state


[00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:51,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m45s)

manager so specifically we are calling


[00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:54,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m49s)

go to state and we're looking for go to


[00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:58,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m51s)

state common so let's take a look at


[00:52:54,460 --> 00:53:02,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m54s)

that for reference this is the resharper


[00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:05,380](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h52m58s)

decompiled source so we're gonna just


[00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m02s)

keep diving so go to state common so we


[00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:14,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m05s)

got two here now we're looking for a go


[00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:18,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m07s)

you state internal see get visual state


[00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:18,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m14s)

go to state internal


[00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:38,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m26s)

okay go to state internal and this guy


[00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:40,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m31s)

here generate dynamic transition


[00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:44,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m38s)

animations generate dynamic transition


[00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m40s)

animations just gonna make sure you do


[00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m44s)

want to keep an eye out


[00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:49,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m45s)

especially when walking through these


[00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m46s)

call stacks like this sometimes a method


[00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:55,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m49s)

will call out to the same thing multiple


[00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:56,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m50s)

times let's see here we are looking for


[00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:01,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m55s)

[Music]


[00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:08,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h53m56s)

storyboard where did you get so you get


[00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:11,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m01s)

created their return to their storyboard


[00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:17,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m08s)

get some properties set on it children


[00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:20,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m11s)

from to great great transition animation


[00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:26,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m17s)

where I just stirs up a completed


[00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:31,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m20s)

handler at least in this case start new


[00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:34,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m26s)

then stop old and this is where I'm not


[00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,869](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m31s)

sure that we actually have a bug because


[00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:41,609](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m34s)

I do expect some of these objects to be


[00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:44,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m36s)

created and newer ones to exist but I


[00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:47,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m41s)

also expect that if your button control


[00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:50,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m44s)

goes away that they are then


[00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m47s)

de-allocated


[00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:07,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h54m57s)

let's test that theory okay so let's


[00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:09,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m02s)

let's fire this up and do because this


[00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m07s)

is unfortunately got way too much going


[00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:15,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m09s)

on in it and it's a little difficult to


[00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:21,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m11s)

go through let's do a very simple WPF


[00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:23,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m15s)

project and verify that we that things


[00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:25,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m21s)

are actually being cleaned up because I


[00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m23s)

don't mind if the ripple instance stays


[00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m25s)

alive as long as to say its parent


[00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:37,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m27s)

button is there but it should be cleaned


[00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:41,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m30s)

up once that button is removed let's see


[00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:43,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m37s)

just go the predefined one yep recent


[00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m41s)

templates apparently I do a lot of WPF


[00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:49,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m43s)

stuff let's see here we are going to go


[00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:52,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m47s)

I keep most of my stuff in the dev


[00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:57,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m49s)

folder and we're gonna call it clearly


[00:55:52,320 --> 00:56:02,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m52s)

WPF will app one let's see mdi-x memory


[00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:07,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h55m57s)

test and we will spell correctly because


[00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:09,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m02s)

that's important and sure I think what


[00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:14,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m07s)

we'll do is we'll just create a very


[00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:17,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m09s)

simple project that can show and hide a


[00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:21,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m14s)

button or I should say add and remove a


[00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:26,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m17s)

button and then we'll verify that our


[00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:29,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m21s)

memory allocations don't increase as we


[00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:30,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m26s)

make it appear and disappear because


[00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m29s)

again that's that's the one thing that


[00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,580](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m30s)

I'm that I'm worried about is that that


[00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:39,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m32s)

static list holds on to it but I'm also


[00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:46,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m35s)

aware that this guy should be getting


[00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:54,870](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m39s)

cleared because this does register a


[00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:56,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m46s)

class level handler which is fine there


[00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m54s)

should only ever be one of these and


[00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m56s)

it's registered up on a static


[00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h56m58s)

constructor which means it won't be


[00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:05,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m00s)

invoked multiple times so all of this


[00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m02s)

code looks correct to me I don't see


[00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:08,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m05s)

anything that's jumping it out and


[00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m07s)

saying


[00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:13,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m08s)

memory leak and so I'm I'm suspecting


[00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:18,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m10s)

that that that that instance count that


[00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:21,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m13s)

was seen is a little bit misleading


[00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,720](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m18s)

simply because again I'm okay with those


[00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m21s)

allocations showing up and not going


[00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:30,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m23s)

away until the button disappears because


[00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m28s)

if you click on a button and it has to


[00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:35,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m30s)

allocate a ripple and do a storyboard


[00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:38,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m32s)

animation that's expected because that


[00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:39,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m35s)

storyboard animation by default it's


[00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m38s)

going to play all the way through and


[00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m39s)

then WPF is going to keep that


[00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m41s)

storyboard active to hold your control


[00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m43s)

at the completed state of that


[00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m45s)

storyboard so it's going to stay there


[00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,610](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m48s)

and that instance is going to stay


[00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m49s)

active so it doesn't shock me that those


[00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:57,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m52s)

ones are still alive again if they're


[00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:59,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m55s)

still around after we get rid of the


[00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:02,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m57s)

button however that is definitely a


[00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:14,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h57m59s)

problem so let's go and grab


[00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:18,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m02s)

let's see browse Tyrael design and let's


[00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:24,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m14s)

grab this guy here and we are let's grab


[00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:27,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m18s)

so dependency highest let's grab


[00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:29,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m24s)

pre-releases too so I mentioned before


[00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:32,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m27s)

if people want to test the latest to 6l


[00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m29s)

code all you have to do on your nougat


[00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:37,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m32s)

package manager' check this box for


[00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:40,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m34s)

include pre-release this will then


[00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:42,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m37s)

update the versions available over here


[00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m40s)

and lets you pick as you can see there


[00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:47,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m42s)

is a ton you can always go back and pick


[00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:49,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m45s)

the two five one release or you can grab


[00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m47s)

all of the two six out stuff that's in


[00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m49s)

there so we are going to grab the latest


[00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m51s)

to 600 pre-release because we want all


[00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m53s)

the things we're gonna grab the highest


[00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m56s)

dependency just to make sure I get my


[00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:07,240](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m57s)

latest colors library that goes along


[00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:07,240](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h58m59s)

with it and install we we go


[00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m15s)

and just for fun we're gonna come over


[00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m17s)

here and I


[00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:27,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m18s)

I usually just steal this type of stuff


[00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:38,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m21s)

right out of the demo app and we should


[00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:44,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m27s)

be able to grab this and this that


[00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:45,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m38s)

should be enough for us and if it's not


[00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m44s)

that'll tell me there's something else


[00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m45s)

that needs to be addressed before we


[00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m47s)

release to sick so so we are going to do


[00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m50s)

a so it is it is important to note that


[00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:59,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m53s)

these lines are inside of the merge


[00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:03,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m56s)

dictionary collection of the application


[00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:04,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=00h59m59s)

resource dictionary so by default this


[01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m03s)

is what your file looks like to actually


[01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m04s)

be able to and and to actually be able


[01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:15,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m07s)

to access that merge dictionary


[01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:18,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m09s)

collection we need to actually declare a


[01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m15s)

resource dictionary so we'll declare the


[01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m18s)

resource dictionary instance and then we


[01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m19s)

will grab its merge dictionary


[01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:28,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m22s)

collection and we're just going to add


[01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:34,380](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m23s)

some items to it so what we want is this


[01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:37,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m28s)

because that is nope I don't want the


[01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m34s)

bundled one I want the or I do want the


[01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:43,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m37s)

bundle one I don't want the customs team


[01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:45,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m39s)

so this is the new way of doing colors


[01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:47,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m43s)

and theming for those people who haven't


[01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m45s)

seen it before so all of those extra


[01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m47s)

dictionaries you still need to bring


[01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m48s)

this dictionary in it's what loads up


[01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:56,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m50s)

the default WPF styles for all of your


[01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:59,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m53s)

controls but now you have a simple way


[01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:02,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m56s)

of just coming in here and going well


[01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,990](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h00m59s)

what what do we want to use and because


[01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m02s)

these are just enums you get a nice list


[01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:08,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m03s)

in your intellisense you can pick


[01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:11,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m05s)

through the colors the whole new theming


[01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:14,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m08s)

api is it's much simpler to work with


[01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m11s)

it's also extendable so all of the mah


[01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:18,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m14s)

app stuff that was kind of hard coded in


[01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:21,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m15s)

the library is now gone and moved up


[01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:24,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m18s)

into the my Apps integration library


[01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m21s)

where it should be so back to our window


[01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:29,339](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m24s)

so what are we going to do we are going


[01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:40,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m26s)

to start with a button


[01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:46,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m29s)

content click me great it's actually not


[01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:49,049](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m40s)

gonna work so content control we're


[01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:51,359](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m46s)

gonna do something a little fancier here


[01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:54,089](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m49s)

because we want to be able to both have


[01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m51s)

this control be added to the visual tree


[01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:58,529](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m54s)

and remove from the visual tree so


[01:01:55,710 --> 01:02:03,499](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m55s)

that's more something like a conditional


[01:01:58,529 --> 01:02:10,589](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h01m58s)

data template will work so we will add a


[01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:15,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m03s)

checkbox content show button give it a


[01:02:10,589 --> 01:02:23,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m10s)

name so we can reference it show button


[01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:23,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m15s)

check box great and then this guy here


[01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:44,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m24s)

content control style I'll target type C


[01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:50,339](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m37s)

content control style triggers and a


[01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:55,579](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m44s)

simple trigger on source name show


[01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:59,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m50s)

button checkbox property is checked


[01:02:55,579 --> 01:03:02,789](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m55s)

value true so when we check the box this


[01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:07,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h02m59s)

trigger will then fire let's see so we


[01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:10,249](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m02s)

are going to set property content


[01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,249](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m07s)

template


[01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:22,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m13s)

to be a setter we want to set the value


[01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:31,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m18s)

this needs to be a data template and he


[01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:38,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m22s)

will itself contain a button the content


[01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:46,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m31s)

quickly boy that's a lot of work so


[01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:50,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m38s)

vertical alignment Center horizontal


[01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:52,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m46s)

alignment Center and normally I would go


[01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:54,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m50s)

through and do grid rows and to make


[01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m52s)

sure these things don't overlap but


[01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:58,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m54s)

we're just going quick and dirty right


[01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:02,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m55s)

now horizontal line the center vertical


[01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:05,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h03m58s)

alignment bottom and just so he's off


[01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:07,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m02s)

the bottom a little bit give him a


[01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:12,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m05s)

little bit of margin great


[01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:21,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m07s)

okay so pile this guy and then let's go


[01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:28,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m12s)

back over here so is there a way to do a


[01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:30,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m21s)

new session it may have already kicked


[01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:34,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m28s)

me out of the old ones so that may that


[01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:38,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m30s)

may narrow down my choices right away so


[01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m34s)

memory hey


[01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:50,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m39s)

that worries me I don't quite know what


[01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:53,610](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m45s)

I just pressed a source name cannot be


[01:04:50,920 --> 01:05:04,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m50s)

set in a style trigger okay


[01:04:53,610 --> 01:05:10,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h04m53s)

data trigger binding binding element


[01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:13,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m04s)

name show button checkbox is checked


[01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:13,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m10s)

pile


[01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:29,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m19s)

okay it runs it works as our executable


[01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:32,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m25s)

open okay so we are going to run this


[01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:38,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m29s)

guy and then verify first that our app


[01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:41,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m32s)

actually works okay show button no show


[01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:47,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m38s)

button show button no show button show


[01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:49,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m41s)

button so the key thing here is just


[01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m47s)

gonna fire this guy off a bunch and I


[01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:58,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m49s)

would expect my my total memory being


[01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:58,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m52s)

shown here to largely stay constant


[01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:07,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h05m59s)

which despite the fact that it goes up


[01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:11,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m04s)

and then GC runs at some point and then


[01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:16,720](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m07s)

it clings back up the fact that I can't


[01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:19,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m11s)

get this to really jump and stay higher


[01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:30,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m16s)

is a good sign already okay so we're


[01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:37,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m19s)

gonna grab a snapshot and then click


[01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:37,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m30s)

this a bunch uncheck uncheck


[01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:42,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m39s)

and check


[01:06:52,690 --> 01:07:00,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m52s)

good snapshot and I would hope that this


[01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:03,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h06m55s)

would be almost identical if there's any


[01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:08,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m00s)

new objects allocated I kind of want to


[01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:11,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m03s)

check what they are so let's do this


[01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:15,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m08s)

claims there's some some amount of items


[01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m11s)

let's see what we're working with


[01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:31,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m20s)

okay so almost nothing we do have some


[01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:34,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m25s)

animation clocks again though I'm not


[01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:41,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m31s)

concerned with a single one being


[01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:47,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m34s)

allocated so let's go go back here one


[01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:50,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h07m41s)

more time and let's do one more round of

[01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:21,659](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m15s)

I'm noticing it does seem like I've


[01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:26,009](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m17s)

Mabel been finally gotten into crust 75m


[01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:32,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m21s)

egg worries me a little bit let's grab


[01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:34,049](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m26s)

another snapshot ideally with a smaller


[01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:44,299](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m32s)

app like this it should be much easier


[01:08:34,049 --> 01:08:48,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m34s)

to to pick out so let's compare 2 to 3


[01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:48,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m44s)

and see where we're at


[01:08:49,489 --> 01:09:03,299](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m49s)

so going from 2 to 3 does still show


[01:08:54,779 --> 01:09:07,949](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h08m54s)

something in here it does bother me that


[01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:15,839](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m03s)

it seems like the because none of these


[01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:18,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m07s)

are tied very tightly to do anything in


[01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:22,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m15s)

our library which would mean we are


[01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m18s)

misusing something


[01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,969](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m27s)

again the problem that I'm bothered by


[01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:36,069](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m29s)

the most is that there's nothing in that


[01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:38,989](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m31s)

code that seems to indicate a problem


[01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:41,029](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m36s)

especially with a count this small of


[01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:53,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m38s)

three this almost says to me like


[01:09:41,029 --> 01:10:00,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m41s)

something's being held on to that a not


[01:09:53,540 --> 01:10:02,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h09m53s)

matter that much it's like a the deltas


[01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:02,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m00s)

here real quick


[01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:21,659](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m07s)

this value man this really does look


[01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:28,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m15s)

like something that's very tied into the


[01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:42,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m21s)

visual state manager let's go back to


[01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:46,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m28s)

this guy here so that's not that's been


[01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m42s)

long since fixed


[01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:14,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h10m59s)

yeah using the sealer profiler yeah yeah


[01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:17,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m11s)

I mean this is this is useful but this


[01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:22,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m14s)

is not this is not enough to actually


[01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:26,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m17s)

track down especially when this is


[01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:33,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m22s)

saying that the Delta is only oh but we


[01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:40,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m26s)

ended with it shown oh oh that could be


[01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:43,990](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m33s)

the problem okay so do you understand


[01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:51,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m40s)

how do I get back to my workspace that


[01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:51,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m43s)

word is this guy open so take me back


[01:11:52,230 --> 01:12:01,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m52s)

let's let's do this one more time so we


[01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:04,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h11m56s)

are off no memory there at all so we're


[01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:09,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m01s)

gonna collect a clean snapshot here and


[01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:12,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m04s)

we are going to run through and see if


[01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:15,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m09s)

we can get this memory leak to happen so


[01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:18,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m12s)

show click-click click-click make the

[01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:34,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m22s)

[01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:37,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m28s)

that it there force a GC and then let's


[01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:38,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m34s)

grab another snapshot I'm very


[01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:40,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m37s)

interested in comparing these two


[01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m38s)

because I'm wondering that that last


[01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:46,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m40s)

comparison showed a single ripple


[01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:55,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m42s)

instance as being the the delta and if


[01:12:46,180 --> 01:13:04,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m46s)

that is the case uncheck that one so


[01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:06,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h12m55s)

there so that is very very low again we


[01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:08,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m04s)

started from an empty state and we went


[01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:14,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m06s)

to an empty state which is what


[01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:17,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m08s)

interests me the most object deltas


[01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:21,040](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m14s)

basically nothing between them okay so


[01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:22,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m17s)

I'm going to think that the deltas we


[01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m21s)

were looking at before was based upon


[01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:27,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m22s)

the sending state of whether we had the


[01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m24s)

button there or not so if that we


[01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:32,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m27s)

stopped with the button visible our new


[01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:35,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m29s)

and we our base memory profile showed


[01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:40,360](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m32s)

one so I'm going to claim that I don't


[01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:43,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m35s)

see a memory leak here and I think for


[01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,739](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m40s)

now so we will I will go back through


[01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m43s)

and add a comment on that issue with a


[01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:49,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m44s)

little bit more data and information


[01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:56,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m47s)

possibly leaving this on there as well


[01:13:49,620 --> 01:14:01,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m49s)

just as a simple test but I think that


[01:13:56,050 --> 01:14:03,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h13m56s)

probably this is this is unlikely to be


[01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:06,159](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m01s)

something that needs to be addressed


[01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:07,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m03s)

so because especially with doing it with


[01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:10,929](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m06s)

the demo app there's a lot going on it


[01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:13,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m07s)

is a hard app to try to do but if it is


[01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:15,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m10s)

down to just this ripple and this


[01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m13s)

reference count is what's happening it


[01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:19,239](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m15s)

would be very likely that this reference


[01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:21,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m17s)

count is just because there were 10


[01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:23,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m19s)

buttons with ripples on the page that


[01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:26,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m21s)

got allocated which again is perfectly


[01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m23s)

fine as long as the the buttons are


[01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m26s)

still there once the button goes away if


[01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m28s)

this ripple count doesn't go back down


[01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:36,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m30s)

then we have a problem but in this case


[01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:38,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m33s)

I it should be fine so again I'm gonna


[01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:41,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m36s)

come back and I will add more comments


[01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:44,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m38s)

there but let's see what else is on the


[01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m41s)

chopping block so unless people are


[01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:49,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m44s)

interested in seeing if anyone has any


[01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:51,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m47s)

questions or thing you want to see I


[01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m49s)

will go through and do this so this is


[01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:55,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m51s)

just a wiki change let's take a look at


[01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:58,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m53s)

this icon button this this looks like


[01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:01,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m55s)

it's probably a better a little bit more


[01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:05,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h14m58s)

fun so Magnus put in this pull request


[01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:08,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m01s)

and he's done several improvements just


[01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:11,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m05s)

kind of bringing the components up to


[01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:16,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m08s)

speed as far as the changes to material


[01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:20,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m11s)

design so PR adds two styles for icon


[01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:25,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m16s)

buttons they're variation of our flat


[01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:26,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m20s)

button great they look pretty so there


[01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:29,500](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m25s)

is a


[01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m26s)

a hard-coded icon size we'll take a look


[01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:34,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m29s)

at the original implementation while


[01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m32s)

this real quick while we're doing this


[01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:38,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m34s)

pull request let's just open this guy up


[01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:41,559](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m36s)

real quick so pull request


[01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:42,099](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m38s)

12:47 so we'll come down here pull


[01:15:41,559 --> 01:15:47,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m41s)

request


[01:15:42,099 --> 01:15:50,349](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m42s)

12:47 double click so for people who


[01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m47s)

were unaware I absolutely love get


[01:15:50,349 --> 01:15:54,639](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m50s)

cracking I think it is well worth the


[01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:58,360](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m52s)

money the amount of time that it saves


[01:15:54,639 --> 01:16:00,369](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m54s)

me on dealing with get issues there are


[01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h15m58s)

a lot of really good get clients out


[01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:05,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m00s)

there and I work with a lot of people


[01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:10,659](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m02s)

who swear by the command line and love


[01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:14,079](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m05s)

it however the one thing that always


[01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:17,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m10s)

gets me is this visualization of the the


[01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:19,210](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m14s)

history tree this is what I have trouble


[01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:21,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m17s)

living without being able to visually


[01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:24,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m19s)

identify where branches are in relations


[01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m21s)

to other branches where mergers have


[01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m24s)

gone where things have moved back and


[01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:32,889](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m25s)

forth is amazing


[01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,809](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m27s)

so this feature alone there are other


[01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:38,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m32s)

get tools that also try to show history


[01:16:34,809 --> 01:16:40,829](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m34s)

graphs I have yet to find one that is


[01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:43,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m38s)

get Krakens equal when it comes to how


[01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:47,619](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m40s)

easy to read and and beautiful this


[01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:50,349](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m43s)

looks so that I I will get off my


[01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:54,309](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m47s)

soapbox get cracking is awesome I


[01:16:50,349 --> 01:16:56,949](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m50s)

recommend it ok it's back to where we


[01:16:54,309 --> 01:17:00,309](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m54s)

were we're gonna leave that open let's


[01:16:56,949 --> 01:17:05,679](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h16m56s)

jump into here real quick and reload so


[01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:07,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m00s)

we've got changes ok so let's see the


[01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m05s)

original implementation leaves the


[01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:12,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m07s)

circle background showing when the


[01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:16,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m08s)

button has focus so I admitted this from


[01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:19,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m12s)

the style which is fine I'm not a huge


[01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:21,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m16s)

fan so there this library gets a little


[01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:24,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m19s)

weird because a lot of the material


[01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:28,329](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m21s)

design stuff the specification isn't


[01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:29,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m24s)

designed for WPF desktop interaction


[01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:32,409](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m28s)

where you might have somebody tabbing


[01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:34,809](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m29s)

into a control gaining focus interacting


[01:17:32,409 --> 01:17:37,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m32s)

with it moving out that just doesn't


[01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:40,179](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m34s)

really happen and so there are some


[01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,629](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m37s)

things like the the visual state of a


[01:17:40,179 --> 01:17:44,859](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m40s)

control


[01:17:40,629 --> 01:17:46,959](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m40s)

are kind of gray areas where sort of up


[01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:50,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m44s)

to us to figure out what what we think


[01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:52,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m46s)

is best so we this library tries to be


[01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:55,209](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m50s)

as unup enya nated as possible and let


[01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:58,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m52s)

and then leave you in as much control as


[01:17:55,209 --> 01:18:03,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m55s)

we reasonably can do so and still having


[01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:05,769](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h17m58s)

this work so let's see to always show


[01:18:03,219 --> 01:18:08,289](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m03s)

this is why is in the demo show what it


[01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:10,719](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m05s)

could look like so I assumed this guy


[01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:13,229](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m08s)

here to show the background is what he's


[01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m10s)

referencing there I have named


[01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:18,579](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m13s)

foreground button to match the name in


[01:18:15,219 --> 01:18:23,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m15s)

style of tool button variants awesome


[01:18:18,579 --> 01:18:25,989](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m18s)

and usually Magnus's stuff is great so


[01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:30,449](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m23s)

first of all we've got something in our


[01:18:25,989 --> 01:18:33,639](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m25s)

buttons demo that brings this in great


[01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:36,939](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m30s)

and then we've got some changes in the


[01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:40,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m33s)

button styles looks like some white


[01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:42,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m36s)

space cleanup here alright it's


[01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m40s)

basically okay hang on


[01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:49,479](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m42s)

there's a fancy button hide white space


[01:18:45,849 --> 01:18:51,459](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m45s)

changes apply and reload so we don't


[01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:53,019](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m49s)

actually have to review white space


[01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:57,579](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m51s)

changes because for the most part unless


[01:18:53,019 --> 01:19:00,719](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m53s)

your white space is really ugly I am in


[01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:06,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h18m57s)

full support of cleaning up white space


[01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:10,449](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m00s)

elsewhere so width and height so when he


[01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:14,379](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m06s)

said his was hard-coded this is probably


[01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:22,449](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m10s)

the reference here the pack icon width


[01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:26,039](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m14s)

and height being said okay I don't know


[01:19:22,449 --> 01:19:26,039](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m22s)

if that's a big deal because this


[01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:36,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m28s)

this could be could be dealt with and


[01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:46,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m32s)

I'm not in any big rush to to handle it


[01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:46,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m36s)

so foreground button so I'm curious the


[01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:51,380](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m46s)

background text field background so he's


[01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:53,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m49s)

actually setting the background on this


[01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:59,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m51s)

last one which is what's causing it okay


[01:19:53,950 --> 01:20:00,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m53s)

let's pull it up and take a look for


[01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h19m59s)

reference these types of pull requests


[01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:08,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m00s)

that come with nice examples already


[01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:14,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m05s)

tied into the demo app make my life very


[01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:16,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m08s)

very easy especially and Magnus does a


[01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m14s)

great job with this but going through


[01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:20,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m16s)

and making sure especially if you're


[01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:24,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m18s)

going to add a new control style showing


[01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:29,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m20s)

it in the the various states of disabled


[01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:31,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m24s)

enabled active and occasionally if


[01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m29s)

there's configuration options for common


[01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:38,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m31s)

things showing off all of those this is


[01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:41,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m34s)

this is perfect makes my life very very


[01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:45,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m38s)

easy and the easier it is for me to


[01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:45,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m41s)

review the faster it usually gets merged


[01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:49,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m46s)

come on little buddy you can do it you


[01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m49s)

can do it


[01:20:49,670 --> 01:21:07,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m49s)

I know compiling is hard especially well


[01:20:53,660 --> 01:21:07,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h20m53s)

streaming packet exited with reference


[01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:13,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m07s)

so we are going to see if we can cheat


[01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:17,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m10s)

typically it when you run into this bug


[01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:21,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m13s)

is because you've changed branches or


[01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:24,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m17s)

maybe recently updated a branch and so


[01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:25,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m21s)

it'll bite you I'm gonna just close down


[01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:29,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m24s)

my memory test just so I don't get


[01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:31,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m25s)

confused with it and what happens is


[01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:37,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m29s)

your MS build process when you compile


[01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:40,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m31s)

an app sticks around which is really


[01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:45,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m37s)

really unfortunate


[01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:47,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m40s)

see the msbuild process let's just try a


[01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:51,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m45s)

rebuild


[01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:56,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m47s)

and because the msbuild process stays


[01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:58,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m51s)

running it'll hold on to any dll's that


[01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:00,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m56s)

it needs for doing the compile so for


[01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:04,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h21m58s)

example packet which is what we're using


[01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:07,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m00s)

instead of nougat gets loaded up as part


[01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m04s)

of an MS build task it then goes through


[01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:11,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m07s)

and MS builds is holding a reference to


[01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:13,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m09s)

that DLL so if you switch to an older


[01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:16,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m11s)

branch that maybe has a different


[01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:18,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m13s)

version it doesn't necessarily let go of


[01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:20,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m16s)

the previous one and so it can very


[01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:22,490](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m18s)

easily get itself confused the simplest


[01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:26,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m20s)

solution is just close and relaunch


[01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:28,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m22s)

Visual Studio but I am doing my best to


[01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m26s)

avoid having to do that because it


[01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:36,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m28s)

always bothers me that it's a little


[01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:39,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m29s)

slow and a lot of the slowness does come


[01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:43,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m36s)

from resharper being installed but for


[01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:48,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m39s)

the most part I find that the benefits


[01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:52,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m43s)

of resharper outweigh the cons a lot of


[01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:52,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m48s)

people disagree with me but that's okay


[01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:56,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m52s)

another question that has been popping


[01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:59,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m54s)

up frequently is people asking when this


[01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:04,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m56s)

library is going to support dotnet core


[01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:06,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h22m59s)

3 or as it's going to be known dotnet 5


[01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:08,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m04s)

and the answer is there is an


[01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:10,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m06s)

outstanding issue


[01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:14,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m08s)

11:43 to go through and keep an eye on


[01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:16,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m10s)

rebuild all successful yes full rebuild


[01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:21,500](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m14s)

fixes it


[01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:26,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m16s)

so issue number 11 43 it's currently


[01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:28,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m21s)

assigned to James the original owner of


[01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m26s)

the library he had said that he wanted


[01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:34,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m28s)

to work on it and self-assigned it which


[01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:37,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m31s)

is great so be aware that there is


[01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:40,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m34s)

progress being made on that and there


[01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:43,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m37s)

will be net core 3 support coming


[01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:44,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m40s)

hopefully soon I'm not the one working


[01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:47,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m43s)

on it


[01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:48,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m44s)

so I don't have a great estimate if


[01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:50,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m47s)

you've got questions you can post them


[01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:52,160](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m48s)

there I know he's been quite busy which


[01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m50s)

is why I've been doing a lot of the


[01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:57,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m52s)

maintenance on the library


[01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:59,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m54s)

but it will be coming and I can assure


[01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:01,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m57s)

you that I will make sure it gets done


[01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:04,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h23m59s)

before the release of net core flaw or


[01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:07,240](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m01s)

done at 5:00 because I'm gonna want it


[01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:09,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m04s)

at that point at a bare minimum so I


[01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:16,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m07s)

assume this was in our buttons and


[01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:21,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m09s)

toggles page and let's come down here


[01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:27,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m16s)

where is it where are you there they are


[01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:30,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m21s)

hey they are way over on the right so


[01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:32,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m27s)

material design icon button I assume


[01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:35,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m30s)

this is just disabled and it's enabled


[01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:43,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m32s)

false great and that guy is a little


[01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:47,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m35s)

obnoxious but dang it this is part of


[01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:52,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m43s)

why we redid this thing so foreground


[01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:55,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m47s)

button and then icon button okay so


[01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:58,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m52s)

that's that's fine I think let's just


[01:24:55,820 --> 01:25:01,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m55s)

take a quick gander at this guy real


[01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:04,160](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h24m58s)

quick because I am curious what it takes


[01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:07,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m01s)

if hypothetically I decide I want to


[01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:12,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m04s)

change that that icon size so let's just


[01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:12,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m07s)

go and pick on the first one here so


[01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:28,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m14s)

grab that guy and not where we're going


[01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:32,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m24s)

not where we're going paste icon button


[01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:37,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m28s)

areas okay so first thing I want to play


[01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:43,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m32s)

with is this size that was put in so we


[01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:46,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m37s)

know that this guy here was set to 48 48


[01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:54,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m43s)

so let's just double that somewhere


[01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:57,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m46s)

around with 100 and height 100 so how


[01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:57,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h25m54s)

does it play when I do that


[01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:07,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m00s)

there's that okay that could just be a


[01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:13,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m05s)

live sam'l issue why that thing went


[01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:13,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m07s)

away but I am curious if I can then do


[01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:25,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m15s)

with 48 high 48


[01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:27,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m21s)

because I think this is all I think even


[01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:29,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m25s)

though there's a hard code a hard coded


[01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m27s)

style it's more of a default because if


[01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:36,719](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m29s)

I can just override everything like this


[01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:39,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m32s)

it's not really hard coded so and I


[01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m36s)

think that might just be the live sam'l


[01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:44,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m39s)

failing which is why we lost our pack


[01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:46,739](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m41s)

icon the live sam'l update because it


[01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:49,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m44s)

tries to update on the fly


[01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:51,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m46s)

there's intermediate states and not all


[01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:55,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m49s)

of them are valid and sometimes it just


[01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:57,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m51s)

doesn't recover very well which is


[01:26:55,230 --> 01:27:00,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m55s)

always disappointing most of the time it


[01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:03,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h26m57s)

does work well but it doesn't always


[01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:11,489](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m00s)

let's clear that out of my way but it's


[01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:12,989](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m03s)

not perfect so but I can't rag on the


[01:27:11,489 --> 01:27:15,719](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m11s)

people who made it too much because it


[01:27:12,989 --> 01:27:23,489](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m12s)

is still my favorite tool for editing


[01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:27,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m15s)

the sam'l okay so back down here buttons


[01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:33,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m23s)

and toggles and let's let's go through


[01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:33,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m27s)

and make this guy a little bit bigger so


[01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:38,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m34s)

yeah that works like a charm


[01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:55,469](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m38s)

so 60 60 save even bigger cool I like it


[01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:58,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m50s)

I like it Magnus okay so we are not


[01:27:55,469 --> 01:28:02,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m55s)

gonna keep all my changes that's just


[01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:05,489](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h27m58s)

ugly but what we are going to do is


[01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:10,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m02s)

merge it and then check the result of it


[01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:10,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m05s)

because I know that this page was redone


[01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m11s)

I want to make sure that the demo page


[01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:21,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m14s)

still looks fine afterwards so back to


[01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:27,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m17s)

the pull request let's see


[01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:38,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m21s)

conversations oh and it's add my review


[01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:38,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m27s)

great we can do that so prove it's great


[01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:49,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m44s)

you will do there and get this guy


[01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:51,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m47s)

merged in and again I just want to make


[01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:53,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m49s)

sure cuz I know get is saying it's


[01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:58,970](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m51s)

perfectly happy to merge that but


[01:28:53,600 --> 01:29:00,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m53s)

because we've rearranged that buttons


[01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:04,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h28m58s)

page I do want to go and check it after


[01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:06,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m00s)

this merge goes in so for those paying


[01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:12,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m04s)

close attention that did do a squash


[01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:16,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m06s)

merge so what we need to do now is this


[01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:18,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m12s)

guy our master is now behind by one so


[01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:21,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m16s)

we're just going to pull our master to


[01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:24,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m18s)

bring our local branch pointer even with


[01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:30,200](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m21s)

the remote and then we are going to


[01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:35,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m24s)

switch to our local branch okay and then


[01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:37,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m30s)

we no longer need this because this icon


[01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:42,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m35s)

button was just the pull request branch


[01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:45,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m37s)

that we checked out so let's jump in and


[01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m42s)

probably yeah it's probably going to be


[01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:49,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m45s)

confused again because we just changed


[01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:50,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m47s)

the universe out from underneath it


[01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,810](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m49s)

basically bouncing back and forth


[01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:58,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m50s)

between when that pull request branch


[01:29:53,810 --> 01:30:00,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m53s)

was created and when we are now we're


[01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:04,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h29m58s)

just gonna check that buttons demo page


[01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:07,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m00s)

to see where exactly those buttons ended


[01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:09,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m04s)

up cuz I have a hunch in the back of my


[01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:14,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m07s)

mind that they probably didn't end up in


[01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:15,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m09s)

the right place and in theory it


[01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:17,870](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m14s)

probably would have been better to take


[01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:21,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m15s)

the pull request branch rebase it on to


[01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:23,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m17s)

the latest fix it there and then go but


[01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:26,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m21s)

some nights I'm lazy


[01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m23s)

tonight is a lazy night


[01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:32,239](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m27s)

so I do find that the best developers


[01:30:30,349 --> 01:30:33,649](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m30s)

are usually the laziest ones because


[01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:37,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m32s)

they always look for the easiest way to


[01:30:33,649 --> 01:30:40,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m33s)

do things often that means we end up


[01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:44,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m37s)

spending six hours to save one hour of


[01:30:40,849 --> 01:30:47,209](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m40s)

time but we usually feel good about it


[01:30:44,840 --> 01:31:07,729](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m44s)

when we're done doesn't make a lot of


[01:30:47,209 --> 01:31:11,359](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h30m47s)

sense okay next round of caffeine and


[01:31:07,729 --> 01:31:12,949](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m07s)

for those people or watching I am sort


[01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:15,709](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m11s)

of playing around with different stream


[01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:18,349](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m12s)

times and different days and once again


[01:31:15,709 --> 01:31:20,599](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m15s)

packet fails so I am going to try just


[01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:23,119](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m18s)

the recompile all to see if that dumps


[01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:26,389](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m20s)

it and relaunches it but I am playing


[01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:30,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m23s)

around with different stream times and


[01:31:26,389 --> 01:31:32,959](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m26s)

days so just be aware keep an eye on the


[01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:34,639](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m30s)

events list on Twitch because when I


[01:31:32,959 --> 01:31:36,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m32s)

know when I'm going to be streaming I


[01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,389](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m34s)

try to post an event ahead of time so


[01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:42,469](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m36s)

that people get some amount of advance


[01:31:38,389 --> 01:31:44,689](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m38s)

notice usually it's only about a week or


[01:31:42,469 --> 01:31:48,469](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m42s)

so out but just with my current


[01:31:44,689 --> 01:31:50,239](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m44s)

situation I don't always have a good set


[01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:54,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m48s)

day or a set scheduled that I can


[01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:56,829](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m50s)

allocate time for doing this oh boy no


[01:31:54,530 --> 01:32:00,859](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m54s)

boy no okay fine


[01:31:56,829 --> 01:32:04,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h31m56s)

build cancel will just stop it and


[01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:09,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m00s)

relaunch so there will be somewhat


[01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:12,579](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m04s)

varying times I do have a couple other


[01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:16,579](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m09s)

kind of stream topic ideas that I might


[01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:18,859](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m12s)

play around with a little bit one of


[01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:22,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m16s)

them is just going through and doing an


[01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:25,639](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m18s)

introduction to WPF with mvvm so the


[01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:28,999](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m22s)

model view viewmodel design pattern you


[01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:31,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m25s)

don't technically need to use mvvm when


[01:32:28,999 --> 01:32:33,829](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m28s)

building a WPF app however with that


[01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:36,859](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m31s)

said in my opinion it is by far the


[01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:38,720](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m33s)

preferred approach it's what you'll also


[01:32:36,859 --> 01:32:41,240](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m36s)

find most


[01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:44,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m38s)

examples are online because WPF was


[01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:45,890](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m41s)

really built around the the binding


[01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:48,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m44s)

engine and how that's expected to work


[01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:51,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m45s)

again you don't have to you can build


[01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:54,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m48s)

WPF apps very similar to how Windows


[01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:56,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m51s)

forms apps were built with event


[01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:58,580](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m54s)

handlers and a lot of stuff in your code


[01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:00,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m56s)

bind and that's fine and you can get an


[01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:04,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h32m58s)

app working the big drawback to that is


[01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:07,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m00s)

testability mvvm kind of breaks that


[01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:09,250](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m04s)

whole idea apart so that you can


[01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:12,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m07s)

actually start to test that interaction


[01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:15,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m09s)

and see it see it actually flow through


[01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:19,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m12s)

there so I may end up starting to do a


[01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:20,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m15s)

kind of a side series on that so even


[01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:25,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m19s)

though I will probably do those as live


[01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:27,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m20s)

streams they may just be ad hoc a lot


[01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:30,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m25s)

shorter than normal largely just so that


[01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:32,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m27s)

I can get the YouTube videos and I'm if


[01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:35,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m30s)

if people want to jump in and ask


[01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:38,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m32s)

questions I'd be great i I have no


[01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:42,440](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m35s)

problem pausing and doing it I've been


[01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:44,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m38s)

pretty lazy because I know how much time


[01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,490](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m42s)

it takes wanted to actually edit the


[01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:48,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m44s)

videos that I'm posting to youtube so


[01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:50,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m46s)

right now I really haven't been editing


[01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:54,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m48s)

them at all they're really just archives


[01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:57,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m50s)

of the live streams at some point I have


[01:33:54,860 --> 01:34:00,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m54s)

grand aspirations of being able to edit


[01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:03,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h33m57s)

videos and post them like a lot of


[01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:04,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m00s)

streamers do but right now my schedule


[01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:09,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m03s)

does not allow for me to allocate that


[01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:11,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m04s)

many hours to it so if anybody ever


[01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:13,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m09s)

wants to help out and you're great at


[01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:16,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m11s)

video editing I I would not mind having


[01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:19,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m13s)

a chat about it but at least right now


[01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:22,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m16s)

it is is basically me just hitting the


[01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:25,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m19s)

export button and ship it over to


[01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:26,480](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m22s)

YouTube that way there's a kind of a


[01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:29,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m25s)

place to archive it because twitch


[01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:30,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m26s)

doesn't hold onto the videos forever so


[01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:34,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m29s)

for now that's where it's gonna go


[01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:38,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m30s)

something like the mvvm tutorial videos


[01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:41,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m34s)

I might keep high-res copies downloaded


[01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:43,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m38s)

and share those out somewhere I haven't


[01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:45,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m41s)

really decided part of it is is going


[01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:48,950](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m43s)

through and actually building out the


[01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m45s)

build looks like a compiled part of it


[01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:52,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m48s)

is going and building out kind of the


[01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:57,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m50s)

outline of what I want to cover


[01:34:52,670 --> 01:35:00,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m52s)

I've taught various WPF training courses


[01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:05,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h34m57s)

everywhere from like university levels


[01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:08,179](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m00s)

all the way up to like Enterprise


[01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:11,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m05s)

training classes to get companies up to


[01:35:08,179 --> 01:35:12,679](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m08s)

speed and so trying to find a happy


[01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:15,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m11s)

middle ground that makes sense to


[01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:26,619](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m12s)

everybody what is going on here


[01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:29,500](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m15s)

so text document what's going on verify


[01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:34,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m26s)

assembly references


[01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:38,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m29s)

show me the sam'l this sounds like


[01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:43,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m34s)

packet wasn't didn't get run that's what


[01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m38s)

this sounds like to me reference


[01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:54,369](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m45s)

I've won at it boy that sure looks like


[01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:54,369](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m51s)

it should be there


[01:35:55,060 --> 01:36:02,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m55s)

verify that all assemblies have been


[01:35:57,170 --> 01:36:04,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h35m57s)

built so let's rebuild the project one


[01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:06,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m02s)

more time because I'm guessing you got


[01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m04s)

confused


[01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:15,909](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m09s)

so this is another one of those msbuild


[01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:19,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m12s)

type problems because show me the sam'l


[01:36:15,909 --> 01:36:21,469](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m15s)

what it does is it adds a msbuild task


[01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:24,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m19s)

that literally just walks through all of


[01:36:21,469 --> 01:36:27,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m21s)

your zero files treats them like XML and


[01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:31,369](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m24s)

just goes hunting for this zamel display


[01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:33,199](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m27s)

control and it builds up a list so if


[01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:36,580](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m31s)

you look in your obj directory it's


[01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:42,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m33s)

literally just outputting a dictionary


[01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:43,489](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m36s)

that's keyed on the I think it's the key


[01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:46,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m42s)

or identifier property I don't remember


[01:36:43,489 --> 01:36:48,619](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m43s)

exactly which on this control so that


[01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:50,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m46s)

when this control actually shows up in


[01:36:48,619 --> 01:36:57,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m48s)

the sam'l all it does is go out to that


[01:36:50,750 --> 01:37:00,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m50s)

dictionary what is going on here so also


[01:36:57,050 --> 01:37:01,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h36m57s)

verify your project reference okay I


[01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:05,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m00s)

feel like that's lying to me what is


[01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:17,240](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m01s)

what is the actual air


[01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:18,980](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m05s)

see warning warning warning so let's see


[01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:22,850](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m17s)

current version cannot resolve this


[01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:28,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m18s)

reference could not load Shh check to


[01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:31,580](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m22s)

make sure the assembly come on what did


[01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:34,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m28s)

we just do there's no way those two


[01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:40,160](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m31s)

changes did that and we were working


[01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:42,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m34s)

prior so I'm very inclined to believe


[01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:50,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m40s)

that this thing is just flat-out lying


[01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:53,390](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m42s)

to me yeah cuz this guy is claiming that


[01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:57,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m50s)

this whole namespace is missing


[01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:59,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m53s)

okay so clean the solution we might just


[01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:04,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m57s)

have to dump some of this stuff so


[01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:07,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h37m59s)

material design toolkit demo because


[01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:14,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m04s)

clean should be dumping most of this


[01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:21,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m07s)

stuff but when in doubt dump everything


[01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:26,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m14s)

so we'll just wipe those two okay


[01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:26,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m21s)

rebuild let's let's go


[01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:39,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m33s)

so if people are actually interested and


[01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:43,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m36s)

sort of a little bit more generic WPF


[01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:45,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m39s)

type tutorials definitely drop me a


[01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:47,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m43s)

message on the get er chat let me know


[01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:49,740](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m45s)

again I'm I'm sort of looking for


[01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m47s)

feedback I'm doing these live streams


[01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:54,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m49s)

and videos largely for fun but I've also


[01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:58,710](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m52s)

noticed that several people are finding


[01:38:54,710 --> 01:39:04,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m54s)

usefulness from them so what is going on


[01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:07,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h38m58s)

here okay I have to believe there's a


[01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:12,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m04s)

stray Amos build process floating around


[01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:24,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m07s)

trying to sabotage me like that one


[01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:29,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m12s)

right there and it died just good okay


[01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:32,940](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m24s)

okay not seeing anything that screams


[01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:37,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m29s)

Gary didn't die like he you were


[01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:40,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m32s)

supposed to do was normally they would


[01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:46,260](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m37s)

show up as orphaned processes but I do


[01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:47,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m40s)

not see them so let's try rinse third


[01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:50,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m46s)

time's the charm this should not be


[01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:54,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m47s)

taking this long to just verify a demo


[01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:58,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m50s)

app because I would like to get back to


[01:39:54,140 --> 01:40:02,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m54s)

trying to clear out this to 600 release


[01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:08,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h39m58s)

let's go back here to milestones and to


[01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:12,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m02s)

six so let's see here this one's gonna


[01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:13,830](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m08s)

go away the other thing that's not on


[01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:16,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m12s)

this list that really does need to be


[01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:21,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m13s)

added is right now the demo app there's


[01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:26,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m16s)

the old color picker UI and then there's


[01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:28,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m21s)

the new color theming UI and those


[01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:31,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m26s)

really need to be merged


[01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:33,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m28s)

I want to because I've obsoleted the


[01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m31s)

methods being used by the old one I


[01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:39,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m33s)

would like to make sure that those are


[01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:40,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m35s)

no longer shown as examples in the demo


[01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:42,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m39s)

app because I prefer if people would


[01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:46,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m40s)

stop using them because they will be


[01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:46,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m42s)

removed in a future version so they'll


[01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:49,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m46s)

keep working


[01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:51,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m46s)

for now but be aware at least when we


[01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:54,389](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m49s)

read the the major version and go to 3 X


[01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:56,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m51s)

at some later point in the future those


[01:40:54,389 --> 01:41:02,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m54s)

obsolete api's are going to get stripped


[01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:16,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h40m56s)

out so yes I understand visual studio


[01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:19,949](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m02s)

you are unhappy with me okay so I think


[01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:28,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m16s)

you're resolving think about what you've


[01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:32,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m19s)

done you happier now the solution


[01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m28s)

Explorer seems to think you still seem


[01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:38,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m32s)

like you're downloading something in the


[01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:41,909](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m33s)

background or resharper is trying to


[01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:49,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m38s)

grep the entire source code base to find


[01:41:41,909 --> 01:41:55,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m41s)

all the things come on nobody you can do


[01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:56,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m49s)

this you can do this okay so yeah I


[01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:59,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m55s)

understand


[01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:03,179](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m56s)

resharper caused a problem and it might


[01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:10,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h41m59s)

be slowing us down I get it I get it I


[01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:14,780](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m03s)

get it okay go ahead and run and


[01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:18,090](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m10s)

hopefully because this Avalon edit


[01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:21,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m14s)

package is basically the same show me


[01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:23,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m18s)

the zamel except for it pulls in the


[01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:25,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m21s)

Avalon controls for doing fancy syntax


[01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:29,940](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m23s)

highlighting and that kind of thing


[01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:35,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m25s)

which is how we're getting the boy what


[01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:38,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m29s)

is going on okay so let's back all the


[01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:43,969](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m35s)

way out this is this is now bothering me


[01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:43,969](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m38s)

a lot so packages


[01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:52,500](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m46s)

and I am getting quite annoyed with you


[01:42:53,640 --> 01:43:04,140](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h42m53s)

could not resolve this reference this is


[01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:07,680](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m01s)

going to quickly turn into a stream on


[01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:19,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m04s)

assembly reference bindings let's see


[01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:19,560](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m07s)

build logging turn on build logging and


[01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:37,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m22s)

rebuild let's get let's get some details


[01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:40,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m30s)

on exactly what's going on and why for


[01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:44,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m37s)

anyone interested the extension that I'm


[01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:52,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m40s)

running to get this highly recommended


[01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:58,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m44s)

let's find it here to do this I think


[01:43:52,540 --> 01:44:05,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m52s)

it's this project system tools installed


[01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:12,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h43m58s)

all believe it's this guy here just


[01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:17,110](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m05s)

doing quick launch font stylers believe


[01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:20,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m12s)

it's this project system tools for being


[01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:25,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m17s)

able to go through and get at it let's


[01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:25,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m20s)

go back build logging so


[01:44:31,059 --> 01:44:36,270](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m31s)

so the libraries the libraries built


[01:44:33,579 --> 01:44:45,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m33s)

just fine it's just the demo app that


[01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:47,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m36s)

seems to be losing its mind market will


[01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:50,699](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m45s)

compile pass parameters


[01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,699](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h44m47s)

[Music]


[01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:04,520](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m01s)

okay let's


[01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:24,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m10s)

application markup found all these amel


[01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:29,940](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m14s)

great for whatever reason it is not


[01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:37,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m24s)

picking up the Avalon it it so it is not


[01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:45,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m29s)

finding the reference okay so then that


[01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:51,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m37s)

begs the question why resolve project


[01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:51,410](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m45s)

references let's see


[01:45:56,609 --> 01:46:07,739](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m56s)

that's this guy I'm trying to remember


[01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:09,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h45m59s)

which of these which of these is


[01:46:07,739 --> 01:46:14,249](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m07s)

responsible for building up that


[01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:16,739](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m09s)

references list test before resolve


[01:46:14,249 --> 01:46:19,859](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m14s)

references I thought it was gonna be


[01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:26,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m16s)

this resolved project references but I


[01:46:19,859 --> 01:46:31,039](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m19s)

am not seeing what I expected because


[01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:34,039](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m26s)

that's resolved project references not


[01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,039](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m31s)

necessarily


[01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:45,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m40s)

Jefferson whore clean after cleaned


[01:46:50,219 --> 01:47:05,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m50s)

okay well let's let's start with this so


[01:46:55,219 --> 01:47:15,199](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h46m55s)

PowerShell to do CDC : dev toolkit I


[01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:17,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m05s)

believe it's a packet packet Exe I


[01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:21,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m15s)

cannot remember the syntax for this I


[01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:32,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m17s)

think it's just straight-up update let's


[01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:35,940](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m21s)

see I'll install go-go-gadget packet


[01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:38,670](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m32s)

because I think update actually finds


[01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:42,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m35s)

yeah updates dependencies to the latest


[01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:44,790](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m38s)

version not quite what we want we just


[01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:49,469](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m42s)

want to pull down stuff and make sure


[01:47:44,790 --> 01:48:01,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m44s)

everything is there and I think I have


[01:47:49,469 --> 01:48:08,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h47m49s)

one edit live at four five look at that


[01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:13,080](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m01s)

the thing is empty so that is surely the


[01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:15,870](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m08s)

problem why do you think you are


[01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:19,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m13s)

installed correctly when you clearly


[01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:22,290](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m15s)

aren't let's try this one more time


[01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:24,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m19s)

something is clearly dropped to that


[01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:24,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m22s)

reference


[01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:50,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m30s)

I wanna edit four five hey there's the


[01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:56,280](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m45s)

DLL I have no idea what happened there


[01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:59,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m50s)

no idea so sure you've been modified


[01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:01,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m56s)

let's just check and see I understand


[01:48:59,219 --> 01:49:02,969](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h48m59s)

it's been modified but I don't think


[01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:07,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m01s)

there should be any outstanding changes


[01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:08,760](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m02s)

I'm when you run the the packet install


[01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:10,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m07s)

I do believe that it goes through and


[01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:15,360](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m08s)

modifies the CS proj because it rewrites


[01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:17,429](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m10s)

the package references so it doesn't


[01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:19,500](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m15s)

surprise me that the CS prod shows an


[01:49:17,429 --> 01:49:22,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m17s)

update and we can go ahead and turn off


[01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:26,639](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m19s)

the build logging no longer necessary no


[01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,920](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m22s)

longer necessary now for what we started


[01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:31,020](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m26s)

with in the first place to check our


[01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:34,679](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m28s)

demo app to make sure the button layout


[01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:39,570](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m31s)

is correct just what we were going for


[01:49:34,679 --> 01:49:42,330](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m34s)

in the first place at least get one one


[01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:46,440](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m39s)

decent pull request merged in and one


[01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:50,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m42s)

bug I think resolved because I suspect


[01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:52,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m46s)

that that memory leak once we look a


[01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:56,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m50s)

little closer at it is not actually


[01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:56,630](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h49m52s)

going to be an actual memory leak


[01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:09,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m01s)

come on there we go there we go okay


[01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:11,590](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m05s)

let's see where cuz again this page is


[01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:16,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m09s)

now just buttons not buttons and toggles


[01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:18,550](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m11s)

so this guy was happy to merge it and it


[01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:22,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m16s)

merged it over here so I don't think


[01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:24,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m18s)

that's what we want I think ideally try


[01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:27,010](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m22s)

to think these are very similar to the


[01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:28,510](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m24s)

flat buttons so I'm I'm inclined to put


[01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:33,400](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m27s)

them right underneath the flat button


[01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:35,460](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m28s)

styles where I believe they should go so


[01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:38,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m33s)

let's just go and move those real quick


[01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:40,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m35s)

because again get was perfectly happy to


[01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:42,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m38s)

to merge stuff for me I just don't think


[01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,160](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m40s)

it it just doesn't know where to put


[01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:47,880](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m42s)

things


[01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:51,700](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m44s)

let's see grab that


[01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:54,600](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m47s)

take me there so here is all of these


[01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:59,050](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m51s)

guys just great


[01:50:54,600 --> 01:51:00,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m54s)

let's see some margin to put it off from


[01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:02,170](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h50m59s)

the side what container are you and


[01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:04,420](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m00s)

you're just in a stackpanel that's why


[01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:07,930](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m02s)

it's that's why it's still laying out


[01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:11,770](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m04s)

correctly let's see and here are the


[01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:18,820](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m07s)

flat button ones and I think what we do


[01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:28,450](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m11s)

is we just do stack panel we'll put it


[01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:39,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m18s)

sideways let's see sanal and put them in


[01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:45,180](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m28s)

there spelling counts to shun there we


[01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:49,000](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m39s)

go save and this brought that up


[01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:53,580](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m45s)

so this margin is a bit problematic now


[01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:58,030](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m49s)

because we don't really want it there


[01:51:53,580 --> 01:52:00,610](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m53s)

there we go I do think we probably want


[01:51:58,030 --> 01:52:03,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h51m58s)

to take a note from the stack panel


[01:52:00,610 --> 01:52:05,620](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m00s)

above and probably tack on a little top


[01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:07,540](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m03s)

margin just so that there's some


[01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:09,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m05s)

separation between these buttons and the


[01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m07s)

other ones


[01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:22,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m13s)

looks pretty good I'm gonna bring this


[01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:25,060](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m16s)

down just a little bit we have that yeah


[01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:27,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m22s)

because I realize that brings them


[01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:30,430](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m25s)

closer but in these cases these things


[01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:32,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m27s)

are because they don't show their


[01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:34,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m30s)

background the whole time it just makes


[01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:36,130](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m32s)

for a lot of white space looking area


[01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:38,230](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m34s)

even though I realized some of it's


[01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:41,440](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m36s)

occupied so we'll just have that for now


[01:52:38,230 --> 01:52:44,370](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m38s)

I think that looks better okay so now


[01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:58,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m41s)

let's just get those changes up and


[01:52:44,370 --> 01:53:04,690](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m44s)

let's see updating button page moved new


[01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:11,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h52m58s)

let's just grab we can just say icon


[01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:11,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m04s)

buttons to be next to the flat buttons


[01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:25,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m12s)

perfect there goes that push with that I


[01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:28,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m20s)

think we are getting close to end of


[01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:30,640](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m25s)

time on my streams so I think we're


[01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:33,730](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m28s)

probably going to wrap this up at least


[01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:36,910](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m30s)

here tonight I'm going to go through and


[01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:40,150](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m33s)

get a comment written up on this issue


[01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:43,900](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m36s)

and get it closed out or at least moved


[01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:44,650](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m40s)

out of this milestone because I suspect


[01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:48,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m43s)

there's gonna be a little more


[01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:50,470](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m44s)

discussion on it which is great I


[01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:52,120](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m48s)

welcome all feedback from people


[01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:54,310](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m50s)

especially if people are more familiar


[01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:56,800](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m52s)

with doing dot peek but at least from


[01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:59,350](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m54s)

what I can tell I don't think there's a


[01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:04,750](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m56s)

legit leak here that we need to be


[01:53:59,350 --> 01:54:06,220](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h53m59s)

addressing so but if somebody thinks


[01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:09,190](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m04s)

otherwise I would welcome that


[01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:10,660](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m06s)

information as well and then hopefully


[01:54:09,190 --> 01:54:13,960](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m09s)

go through and get some of these other


[01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:15,940](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m10s)

ones merged in I'm gonna try and snipe a


[01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:18,100](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m13s)

couple of these off probably before next


[01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:21,490](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m15s)

stream things like this where it really


[01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:25,899](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m18s)

is just a wiki page update because I


[01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:28,269](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m21s)

have been trying to get the


[01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:31,059](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m25s)

the wiki updated especially when I see


[01:54:28,269 --> 01:54:32,979](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m28s)

people asking questions that I know have


[01:54:31,059 --> 01:54:34,360](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m31s)

been answered in the past I've been try


[01:54:32,979 --> 01:54:37,689](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m32s)

and do start to consolidate those


[01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:40,809](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m34s)

answers from the get ER chat and bring


[01:54:37,689 --> 01:54:43,539](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m37s)

them over here so that you can find them


[01:54:40,809 --> 01:54:45,789](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m40s)

so if people want to contribute to the


[01:54:43,539 --> 01:54:49,479](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m43s)

wiki please feel free to do so the wiki


[01:54:45,789 --> 01:54:51,449](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m45s)

is open for anyone to edit I will be the


[01:54:49,479 --> 01:54:55,300](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m49s)

first to admit that there are


[01:54:51,449 --> 01:54:56,769](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m51s)

inconsistencies in the styling so if you


[01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:59,530](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m55s)

see something inconsistent and you want


[01:54:56,769 --> 01:55:02,139](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m56s)

to fix it please do so the wiki itself


[01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:03,849](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h54m59s)

is a is backed by a git repo so don't


[01:55:02,139 --> 01:55:05,289](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m02s)

worry about breaking anything in the


[01:55:03,849 --> 01:55:08,320](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m03s)

event that there's a problem I can


[01:55:05,289 --> 01:55:10,449](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m05s)

always revert changes so that's again


[01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:14,649](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m08s)

not a big issue to me I would rather


[01:55:10,449 --> 01:55:17,340](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m10s)

people feel free to edit rather than


[01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:20,860](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m14s)

worrying about making some mistake and


[01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:23,709](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m17s)

not getting that in so I think with that


[01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:26,979](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m20s)

we are going to wrap it up for tonight


[01:55:23,709 --> 01:55:30,610](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m23s)

unless anyone has a question and then we


[01:55:26,979 --> 01:55:32,979](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m26s)

will probably shoot for I'm thinking the


[01:55:30,610 --> 01:55:36,219](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m30s)

same time next week again I'm gonna be


[01:55:32,979 --> 01:55:39,099](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m32s)

playing around with different times and


[01:55:36,219 --> 01:55:42,070](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m36s)

days just to see what sticks and what


[01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:43,840](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m39s)

works so if people have feedback or


[01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:47,619](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m42s)

you're enjoying this again I do


[01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:49,269](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m43s)

appreciate seeing the the comments and


[01:55:47,619 --> 01:55:50,949](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m47s)

subscriptions that it helps me actually


[01:55:49,269 --> 01:55:53,769](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m49s)

know that people are watching these and


[01:55:50,949 --> 01:55:56,079](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m50s)

I'm not just wasting all my time so with


[01:55:53,769 --> 01:56:00,659](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m53s)

that we will say goodnight happy coding


[01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:00,659](https://youtu.be/Pq2jIokTj7E?t=01h55m56s)

we'll do it again next week
