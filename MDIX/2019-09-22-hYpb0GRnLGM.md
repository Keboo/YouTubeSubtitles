[okay and we are live again hey everybody](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m09s)



[welcome back it is an exciting day geek](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m12s)



[Christmas as I've been telling everybody](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m16s)



[I ran into today the.net conference is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m18s)



[in full swing and dotnet core 3 o is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m21s)



[finally released](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m24s)



[so no more preview builds the full](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m25s)



[release is finally here and there are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m29s)



[lots of updates and lots of exciting](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m31s)



[stuff so gonna go through a couple](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m33s)



[things tonight before diving back into](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m37s)



[the material design library first and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m39s)



[foremost getting everything updated to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m41s)



[the latest dotnet core 3 oh release so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m44s)



[the the first thing to note if you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m48s)



[haven't done it yet let me switch here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m51s)



[real quick there we go ok so if you have](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h03m54s)



[not downloaded the latest version of.net](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m02s)



[core either chocolaty install it or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m04s)



[dotnet microsoft comm slash download](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m07s)



[that will get you to the download page](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m11s)



[and then grab the version of the sdk](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m14s)



[that lines up with your operating system](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m18s)



[in this case I'm on Windows so I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m21s)



[grab the dotnet core SDK and you should](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m23s)



[see something that looks like 3 dot 0](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m27s)



[dot 100 that comes in there and so if](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m29s)



[anybody's looking to catch up on sort of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m33s)



[the the breadth of everything that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m35s)



[happened there is a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m37s)



[videos that Microsoft has put up as well](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m40s)



[so the the simple link to them is dotnet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m43s)



[slash videos a link in the chat I've](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m48s)



[also got some stuff on my Twitter that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m52s)



[I've been trying to share out as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m55s)



[exciting announcements come through so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h04m57s)



[think of all of the exciting stuff so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m01s)



[there was a whole bunch of the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m04s)



[announcements in regard to c-sharp 8](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m05s)



[that is coming and the big thing coming](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m09s)



[down the pipe with that is nullable](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m12s)



[reference types so just for anybody](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m13s)



[who's unfamiliar with that in all prior](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m17s)



[of c-sharp reference types or classes or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m21s)



[objects always had a default value of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m24s)



[null for c-sharp 8 there's an opt-in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m26s)



[flag that you can turn on where that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m29s)



[actually inverts that premise on its](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m31s)



[head so reference types are then](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m34s)



[explicitly not null unless you say](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m36s)



[otherwise](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m39s)



[so similar to how you could take like a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m41s)



[value type and add a question mark to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m43s)



[make it knowable the same thing will](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m44s)



[then be true of reference types as well](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m47s)



[so unless you declare that it's knowable](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m49s)



[it will you'll have to assign it an](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m52s)



[actual value so it doesn't do anything](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m54s)



[to actually prevent no reference](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m56s)



[exceptions at runtime but it does then](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h05m59s)



[give the compiler a lot of information](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m01s)



[to hopefully go through and find most of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m03s)



[your potential no reference exceptions](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m06s)



[at compile time and give you warnings so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m07s)



[that you can go through and fix it so I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m10s)



[think next week I'm gonna look at going](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m12s)



[through and turning that on on the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m15s)



[material design library just to get that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m16s)



[fired up and see how many things it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m19s)



[catches hopefully not to me bugs](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m23s)



[crossing fingers but we'll we'll see how](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m25s)



[it goes and actually take a look at what](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m28s)



[the process is for getting that turned](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m29s)



[on and actually running so to start](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m33s)



[tonight off because we are doing dotnet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m36s)



[core 3 Oh final release now I was going](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m39s)



[to go through and start with updating](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m43s)



[the pipeline on material design in sam'l](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m45s)



[and kind of take another brief look at](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m47s)



[just the pipeline's in general and how](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m50s)



[they work so if you haven't done](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m51s)



[anything with Azure pipelines](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m54s)



[hopefully this will be a pretty good](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m55s)



[introduction on where to to get going it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h06m57s)



[to start so when in doubt devdas or calm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m00s)



[or DevOps azure comm will redirect as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m04s)



[well and sign in or sign up for Azure](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m07s)



[DevOps as your DevOps has a free tier](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m12s)



[that's very generous so if you're just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m15s)



[looking to play around and see what it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m17s)



[can do sign up take it for a spin](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m18s)



[and especially if you're doing open](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m21s)



[source projects](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m23s)



[the offerings for free public open](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m26s)



[source projects are incredibly generous](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m29s)



[with unlimited a lot of things I don't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m31s)



[quite know or I can't remember all the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m35s)



[details without looking them up so I'm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m37s)



[not gonna try and quote them here but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m38s)



[unlimited public repos build time etc](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m41s)



[etc so in this case for the material](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m45s)



[design project on DevOps](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m49s)



[the library itself obviously lives out](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m50s)



[on github so we're just using DevOps to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m53s)



[host our CI and CD pipelines so that's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m56s)



[continuous integration or or continuous](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h07m59s)



[delivery pipelines so the continuous](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m02s)



[integration portion of it comes from the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m05s)



[build pipeline so there's two](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m07s)



[separations of pipelines here the build](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m10s)



[pipelines are primarily purposed around](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m12s)



[creating something usually producing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m15s)



[some sort of artifacts that can then be](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m18s)



[distributed out whereas the release](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m21s)



[pipelines are primarily concerned with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m22s)



[taking those artifacts from the build](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m25s)



[pipelines or other sources and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m28s)



[distributing them somewhere so in our](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m29s)



[case this is the the primary pipeline](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m33s)



[that we have to work with if you look in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m35s)



[the root of the and I'll just pull it up](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m38s)



[here real quick](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m40s)



[at the root of the I'm just gonna check](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m43s)



[I made the mistake of updating my](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m47s)



[visuals or my dotnet core SDK and then](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m50s)



[realized that in order to use it I have](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m53s)



[to have the updated version of Visual](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m55s)



[Studio so don't update your net core SDK](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h08m56s)



[unless you're actually ready to update](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m00s)



[all your things so the material design](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m02s)



[library jump on over here go google go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m05s)



[if you look in the root of the repo](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m12s)



[there is an azure pipeline CMO file and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m14s)



[when you go through and actually create](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m19s)



[a build pipeline using the default UML](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m21s)



[syntax it'll actually inject this at the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m23s)



[root of your repo so we've got all of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m26s)



[this stuff going on here great awesome](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m28s)



[let's jump back I'm noticing this as a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m31s)



[PR on a release branch do we even have a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m34s)



[release branch was this just a holdover](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m38s)



[from copy and paste deal that I did you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m39s)



[do have released branch oh right right](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m43s)



[right](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m46s)



[that is probably a holdover from when we](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m47s)



[were on out there and can probably get](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m51s)



[removed anyway so back to this we are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m53s)



[going to edit our pipeline and it'll go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h09m57s)



[through and take it just a moment but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m02s)



[the the yamo file that it's gonna load](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m04s)



[up here should hopefully look identical](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m06s)



[to the one that we just saw because we](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m07s)



[are looking at the master branch as soon](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m10s)



[as it figures it out great there we go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m14s)



[we build on a Windows box any CPU build](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m16s)



[configuration is out there this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m21s)



[something that ultimately I want to go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m24s)



[through and change it's the last last](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m25s)



[remnants of at vert left in the codebase](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m28s)



[it doesn't really need to be here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m30s)



[anymore at veilleux's a great build](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m32s)



[system but sometimes you have to set up](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m35s)



[some unusual knobs and widgets for](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m37s)



[special configurations for it and this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m40s)



[is how it was done before but this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m42s)



[the one that we're most interested in so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m44s)



[one of the first steps that it executes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m46s)



[is to go through and install a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m50s)



[particular version of.net core so so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m53s)



[Usenet core SDK and so we are going to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h10m58s)



[switch this guy over here and I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m05s)



[I think what we can do is actually just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m09s)



[do this and let's change the display](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m11s)



[name to match I think this will work I'm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m15s)



[I'm pretty confident we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m17s)



[try it and verify but then for the build](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m22s)



[pipeline it'll execute various steps so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m26s)



[it installs the version of.net core that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m28s)



[we asked for it goes and downloads a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m31s)



[particular version of nougat for us](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m34s)



[let's see let's see use I'm gonna change](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m36s)



[the name of this wall I mean here latest](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m42s)



[nougat cuz it's not actually for three](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m44s)



[oh because we haven't specified a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m46s)



[version for the nougat installer it then](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m47s)



[runs a nougat restore on the root of the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m50s)



[repo which goes through and pulls in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m52s)



[everything we need then does a dotnet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m54s)



[restore targeting the solution and then](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h11m58s)



[finally execute a packet restore I'm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m01s)



[actually a little curious why I might](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m04s)



[have to go and check I I think the only](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m08s)



[reason for this nougat restore stuff is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m10s)



[some of the unit test projects I don't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m11s)



[think are fully leveraging packet and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m15s)



[they probably should be there's kind of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m16s)



[a double-edged sword with using packet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m20s)



[in that it adds complexity but it's also](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m22s)



[solves some issues with oh man I'm just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m24s)



[finding all kinds of bugs I'm just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m28s)



[finding all kinds of bugs so our](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m30s)



[configuration down here is also set to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m32s)



[app fare but it really should be using](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m34s)



[build configuration don't hard-code](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m35s)



[variables used to use the variables](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m40s)



[available to you so after it does the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m42s)



[the dotnet restore and the packet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h12m45s)

[inclusive lower bound let's make that a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h15m39s)



[little bit shall we so changing it from](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h15m43s)



[exclusive lower bound to inclusive lower](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h15m46s)



[bound inclusive lower bound to do](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h15m48s)



[think I want to double-check](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h15m55s)



[I think that's correct](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h15m58s)



[I'm only questioning this two five one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m01s)

[I wrote it down you know that version](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m05s)



[number I think might need to be bumped](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m10s)



[one to do so let's see like thank you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m13s)



[very much and let's let's go and check](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m22s)



[because I think if I remember correctly](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m26s)



[two five one there was a bug in it or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m31s)



[was it two five votes whatever whatever](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m37s)



[is not quite the latest so let's just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m39s)



[look design the nougat package name is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m43s)



[material design themes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m48s)



[so we've got preview releases that go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m53s)



[out so every day where there are changes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h16m58s)



[the the pipeline will automatically kick](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m00s)



[out a release and send it out the door](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m03s)



[let's see so to 600 uh older older older](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m05s)



[to five one two five one would have been](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m11s)



[the bug fix release so that's that's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m15s)



[acceptable so let's change let's check](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m18s)



[this so this is the MA apps wand minimum](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m21s)



[required is two five one and 1 to zero I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m27s)



[think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m30s)



[my check I I'm thinking there I'm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m35s)



[thinking there's a version mismatch here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m38s)



[so let's see let's go back to to 6o](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m40s)



[which is the current release because in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h17m43s)

[I believe let's see we change the or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m01s)



[bound of this to b-26 Oh](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m09s)

[600 we changed the theming library or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m33s)



[the the way theming is done and there](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m35s)



[was several changes that had to go into](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m37s)



[both the colors library as well as the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m42s)



[themes library and so one to O has the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m44s)



[latest and let me just confirm that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m49s)



[maybe maybe I shouldn't do this from](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m53s)



[memory but I believe one to O is the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m55s)



[latest colors release yeah cuz one to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h18m58s)



[one is the CI released so one to O is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m04s)

[here so this guy has the latest stuff](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m09s)



[for all of the theming and color changes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m14s)



[and so if we're gonna set that as the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m16s)



[minimum on him we're gonna need the at](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m18s)



[least to 600 material design themes here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m22s)



[so that should that should take care of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m25s)



[that and let's go and jump back and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m29s)



[check our build pipeline and so that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m31s)



[build past so the the PR technically](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m34s)



[past but I think we just need the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m37s)



[version change and that should be that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m38s)



[should be fine and then version should](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m42s)



[be valid and explicit version well that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m46s)



[is pretty obvious](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m49s)



[so let's jump back here for some reason](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m53s)



[I thought you could do minor version](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m56s)



[revs like that but let's change it real](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h19m59s)

[anything since you already have to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h40m27s)



[namespace the control out anyway so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h40m29s)



[we're just gonna drop that and have the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h40m31s)

[copy from the previous examples up here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h41m28s)



[would be my guess so let's see stack](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h41m31s)

[and then snack bar seven snack bar seven](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h42m29s)



[on click its then the code behind behind](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h42m33s)



[it grabs the sliders value and uses that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h42m36s)



[to convert to seconds so you can have it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h42m42s)

[break the displaying of the content so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h47m36s)

[width and height should adjust that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h47m50s)



[let's expand this out a little bit more](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h47m54s)



[because I'm curious so there is a view](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h47m57s)



[box oh yeah so the the problem being](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m00s)



[here that the the width and height](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m09s)



[properties and so this this can be](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m11s)



[something that gets a little hairy in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m13s)



[WPF there are some properties that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m16s)



[inherently cascade down or affect the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m18s)



[children but what will happen in this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m23s)



[case](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m28s)



[so if you set the width and the height](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m28s)



[these are used for measuring the control](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m30s)



[and also for the layout so even though](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m32s)



[these template bindings I'm sure are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m36s)



[being applied directly to the view box](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m38s)



[the problem is they're also being](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m41s)



[applied to the check box itself which](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m42s)



[means this view box will effectively](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m46s)



[take up the entire size of the space](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m47s)



[allocated for the check box leaving no](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m51s)



[space for this content designer which](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m54s)



[begs the question how should we do this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h48m58s)



[I am thinking that a better approach](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m03s)



[would be to do an attached property](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m08s)



[maybe because an attached property would](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m17s)



[give us the ability to change the size](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m22s)



[of the check box without affecting the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m28s)



[entire control that's probably a better](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m30s)



[fix because there's not there's not a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m34s)



[lot of control over just the Box size](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m36s)



[itself in WPF yeah what was it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m39s)



[previously cuz previously both the width](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m49s)



[and the height were being set did I put](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m51s)



[let's see here did I put a comment on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m56s)



[here as far as what a lot of times I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h49m59s)



[have to leave comments on issues so if](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m03s)



[somebody sees me logging what I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m05s)



[needs to happen don't take that as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m07s)



[gospel sometimes it's just a note for me](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m11s)



[so that I can remember what I was](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m14s)



[thinking let's see so Albert left a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m16s)



[comment on here add the setters for the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m20s)



[height and width with the current values](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m23s)



[change these out this is where they came](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m25s)



[from](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m29s)



[without workarounds yeah so this this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m32s)



[works but it only works unless you have](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m36s)



[content in your check box yeah so this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m39s)



[comment appears to be correct so thumbs](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m46s)



[up there I think we're gonna have to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h50m54s)



[close this out so let's put it let's put](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m02s)



[a comment on here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m06s)



[above a solution will work it will give](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m14s)



[the check box portion of the control the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m25s)



[entire size as a comment on PR was it 12](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m33s)



[cent of 1286 1286 indicates let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m42s)



[this effectively](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m51s)



[leaves the content okay so that'll get](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h51m57s)



[us there](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m06s)



[let's see so what is the correct](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m10s)



[solution then is they is the next](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m12s)



[question that comes along so let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m15s)



[actually log this because I put a good](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m16s)



[first issue on there without actually](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m20s)



[considering the effects of all of those](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m23s)



[steps so one thank you very much for the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m25s)



[pull request](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m28s)



[just because the pull request doesn't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m29s)



[get merged don't let that discourage you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m32s)



[because it is a learning process for all](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m42s)



[of us myself included okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m44s)



[check box we don't have a checkbox](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m48s)



[assist do we](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h52m52s)



[I think what we want to do is create an](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m06s)



[attached property in a checkbox assist](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m08s)



[class so in this library the assist](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m14s)



[classes are basically attached property](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m16s)



[holders where you can go through and set](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m18s)



[stuff up on them](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m23s)



[typically the assist classes correspond](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m24s)



[to the control name so control thingy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m27s)



[that you're trying to modify assist is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m30s)



[the magical incantation okay so I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m32s)



[this we want to do the following so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m41s)



[let's see add a new checkbox Syst class](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h53m48s)



[with an attached property with the name](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m00s)



[check box sighs because I died I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m15s)



[putting the restriction on there that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m20s)



[the that the check box must be a box is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m21s)



[reasonable if this doesn't meet your](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m25s)



[like if somebody has a use case where](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m28s)



[you actually need control over the width](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m30s)



[and the height to make them different](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m31s)



[sizes let me know but even so the the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m33s)



[check that goes inside of it is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m37s)



[expecting to be inside of a square](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m39s)



[control so I don't think it makes a lot](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m41s)



[of sense to allow to the width and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m43s)



[height to be different so one property](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m45s)



[we'll just apply it to both the width](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m48s)



[and the height with the name checkbox](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m49s)



[sighs you can](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m51s)



[use the bah-bah-bah](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m53s)



[let's see toggle button assist as an](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h54m58s)



[example let's see in the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h55m08s)

[example of setting an attached property](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h55m40s)

[get people to contribute to the library](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h55m56s)

[one here toggle button we just saw had](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h56m23s)



[some which means there's almost sure](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h56m27s)



[idli](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h56m31s)



[to do there we go let's see you can see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h56m36s)

[hopefully this comment doesn't get stale](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m00s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m03s)



[and then finally use bindings on the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m04s)



[you box to apply the let's do checks box](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m21s)



[assist dot tex size to both the height](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m32s)



[and width this will hire you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m42s)



[binding not a template binding so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h57m56s)



[template bindings can't bind to attach](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m01s)



[properties but what you can do is do a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m03s)



[binding with a relative source templated](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m11s)



[parent which is close to the same thing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m13s)



[ish it gets the same result the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m16s)



[difference being that a template binding](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m20s)



[will apply it effectively when this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m22s)



[template is compiled](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m24s)



[whereas a relative source binding like](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m26s)



[this will do the determination at](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m29s)



[runtime so it'll effectively end up as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m31s)



[the same same result but it won't but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m35s)



[there is a fundamental difference as to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m40s)



[why that doesn't work this here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m43s)



[okay so comment on the issue](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h58m52s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=00h59m00s)

[look at another one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m21s)



[fix multi lines text box height so I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m22s)



[guess step one let's let's look at the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m27s)



[issue that this is that this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m30s)



[addressing I think I remember this in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m33s)



[that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m38s)



[let's see add new text box with accept](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m40s)



[return true and enough Heights to show](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h01m42s)

[closed but I do care about pull requests](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h02m55s)

[remember right I think that's the way it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m01s)



[works okay so and is editable and this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m03s)



[one's already been merged great so I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m09s)

[perfect perfect perfect](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m17s)



[I believe what we can do so we can just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m19s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m26s)



[kick out that file so get him out of the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m27s)



[diff](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m32s)



[I mean changes that went in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m35s)



[that were added in another BR I do wish](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m44s)



[it would let me batch these that would](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m51s)



[be convenient okay and so then datagrid](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m53s)



[combobox oh that's not what I want](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h03m59s)



[Oh Oh](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m06s)



[let's do this let's do this to do to do](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m10s)

[we'll just we'll just do this here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m35s)



[because I believe let's see 12 97 I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m38s)



[think if I just rebase onto latest that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m43s)



[will probably fix told 97 great and in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m49s)



[general if you are submitting pull](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m57s)



[requests and fixes back to the library](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h04m59s)



[it usually is a good idea to make a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m02s)



[branch and not just pull requests back](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m05s)



[from your master branch that certainly](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m07s)



[works and it's fine if you want to do it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m09s)



[but it does make it difficult if you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m12s)



[want to fix more than one thing at a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m14s)



[time so the the normal workflow is you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m15s)



[get your master branch synched up with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m21s)



[the the main master branch and then you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m25s)



[create a new branch off of that for each](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m28s)



[issue or pull request that you want to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m30s)



[open up okay so 1297 my branch is now](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m32s)



[synced and let's just rebase this guy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m36s)



[and there's there is almost certainly](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m41s)



[conflicts because I just did bad things](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m44s)



[okay let's let's figure out where this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m48s)



[is going here so this is the change in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m52s)

[has filled text](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h05m59s)



[field has filled text fields this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m02s)



[true false](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m06s)

[what did we do what do we do what do we](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m14s)



[do what do we do okay so abort rebase](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m15s)



[let's let's just do a couple things real](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m19s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m47s)



[forced push covers over a multitude of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m52s)



[mistakes okay so that gets me back to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h06m55s)



[there okay now let's go through and take](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m00s)



[a quick look so before I get carried](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m05s)



[away we refresh this this change should](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m08s)



[go back to what it was and then we'll](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m12s)



[see about isolating that out in fact](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m15s)



[let's see some merge merge conflict yeah](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m20s)

[is now back how it was great great great](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m31s)



[this was actually a removal of this to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m39s)



[change these two conditions well I don't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m43s)



[know if I know enough to this look](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m47s)

[actually have to and I'm actually gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m53s)



[have to fire this up and test because I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h07m59s)



[cannot tell from looking at that this if](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h08m01s)



[these conditions are correct is they](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h08m04s)



[they look close yes I think but I am NOT](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h08m05s)



[I am NOT a hundred percent confident so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h08m10s)



[or at least not confident enough to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h08m13s)



[merge this without running so I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h08m15s)

[be pulled in this one is the demo app so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h13m14s)



[I'm a little less concerned about](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h13m18s)



[whether that one needs to be pulled in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h13m20s)

[you have an an older app that's on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m14s)



[framework you're not doing a lot of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m16s)



[updates to it it's sort of running in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m18s)



[maintenance mode that they recommend not](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m20s)



[updating to dotnet core I mostly agree](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m23s)



[with that I if your app really is just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m27s)



[in maintenance mode there there's not](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m30s)



[really a good compelling reason to to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m33s)



[spend a bunch of time and effort](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m35s)



[upgrading it to core](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m36s)



[now with that said if there's newer](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m38s)



[features that you want clearly a lot of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m39s)



[the performance benefits and development](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m42s)



[and effort that Microsoft is doing is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m46s)



[going into dotnet core but Scott hunter](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m47s)

[about things like that but if it's some](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h20m57s)



[of the the newer features or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m00s)



[functionality that you want just be](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m01s)



[aware that all of that sort of new](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m04s)



[development work is going into the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m05s)



[dotnet core it's also worth noting we](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m07s)



[now kind of have two different versions](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m11s)



[of WPF we've got the the WPF framework](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m14s)



[which is what we've been loving all of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m20s)



[these years but now we have WPF built on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m23s)



[dotnet core so the WPF built on dotnet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m26s)



[core has all of the performance](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m31s)



[improvements that have come with core](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m35s)



[single file distribution and all kind of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m39s)



[other exciting stuff that go along with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m41s)



[that but so even though the C sharp that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m43s)



[you write from a source code perspective](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m47s)



[they look basically identical but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m49s)



[functionally and fundamentally they are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m52s)



[two different WPF so just be aware of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m54s)



[that if you're going to build an app if](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h21m59s)



[you go to start a new WPF project start](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m00s)



[and dotnet core don't don't start it on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m02s)



[the old stuff but again if you've got](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m05s)



[something that's an older net framework](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m07s)



[and you're thinking you know should I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m11s)



[update it well the question really comes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m13s)



[how much more development are you going](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m15s)



[to be doing on the app so if this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m17s)



[something where it's just kind of bug](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m20s)



[fixed maintenance mode maybe not a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m21s)



[compelling reason to update it if you're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m24s)



[going to be doing a lot of work and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m27s)



[feature development on it well it may be](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m29s)



[worth kind of weighing the pros and cons](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m31s)



[of what it's gonna cost to do an upgrade](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m35s)



[so just be aware of that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m36s)



[it does also mean evaluating your](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m39s)



[dependencies as well there is a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m42s)



[dependency checker tool that will tell](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m44s)



[you how dotnet core compatible your your](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m46s)



[app is basically walks through all of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m50s)



[the code that you're using and then also](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m52s)



[your third-party libraries and anything](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m55s)



[that is or walks through all your](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h22m57s)



[nougats looking to see what they support](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m01s)



[so if all your dependencies are already](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m03s)



[supporting net core you're good to go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m06s)



[easy upgrade shouldn't be too painful](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m08s)



[the problems come is you know some](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m12s)



[libraries haven't updated some aren't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m14s)



[going to be core compatible etc the last](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m16s)



[thing that's worth knowing is even](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m20s)



[though that this is running on dotnet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m22s)



[core and dotnet core is cross-platform](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m24s)



[this doesn't make WPF cross-platform so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m26s)



[it's just running and getting the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m30s)

[is still only a Windows only](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m39s)

[something that runs on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m45s)



[a Mac xamarin for Mac would probably be](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m47s)



[your best bet to look at there as far as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m49s)



[getting some code sharing and that kind](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m54s)



[of stuff and being able to build out and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h23m56s)

[a while but at one point in time there](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h24m01s)



[were the xamarin team was threatening](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h24m03s)

[was like preview maybe I don't remember](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h24m18s)

[over that would run across that many](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h24m33s)



[platforms because with xamarin forms you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h24m35s)



[get a huge amount of code sharing across](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h24m37s)

[then the combo boxes the datagrid don't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h25m39s)



[appear to pick up the thing of material](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h25m40s)



[design got it so those need to be fixed](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h25m42s)



[perfect okay so I I agree with it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h25m49s)



[however this does move things forward](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h25m54s)



[and I think I want to take this end](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h25m56s)



[great understand issues but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m00s)



[this does help move us forward testing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m08s)



[with laps I am urging as is for now](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m15s)



[we'll probably make some improvements on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m24s)



[this but this at least gets us closer](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m26s)



[so due to squash merge squash merge okay](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m32s)



[and we might come back and and a deal](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m40s)



[with some of those in a little bit I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m43s)



[want to make sure it didn't close the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m45s)



[issue because I think some of this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m48s)



[getting the to do it did close the issue](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m51s)



[let's see let's reopen issue okay](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h26m56s)



[because I do want this guy to be I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h27m04s)

[anything yet today I think let's go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h27m56s)



[through and I think in the in the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m00s)



[interest of breaking stuff](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m04s)



[let's see milestones I think I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m06s)



[start going through and doing some of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m11s)



[the breaking changes just to get these](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m14s)



[guys in and done so let's get master](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m17s)



[pulled up on the latest and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m24s)



[so that has that this feels like a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m33s)



[productive evening we've just been](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m37s)

[emergent stuff left and right so we like](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m41s)



[progress progress progress okay so we're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m45s)



[gonna just do dialogue closing event](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m48s)



[args content let's go and just whack](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h28m51s)



[this guy I believe most of these](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m03s)



[obsolete guys have been in for a while](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m06s)



[the some people really don't like the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m09s)



[obsolete attribute because if you have](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m12s)



[warnings as heirs turned on it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m14s)



[effectively adds a compile error -](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m16s)



[somebody's code however I I don't like](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m18s)



[just straight up breaking changes when](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m24s)



[there's backwards compatibility involved](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m26s)



[so we're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m30s)



[I'm going to I'm gonna just update that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m36s)



[comment real quick because this is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m40s)



[ultimately going to get turned into some](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m42s)



[of the release notes let's see remove](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m45s)



[use instead let's see like that update](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h29m53s)



[comment okay so new references easy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m09s)



[whack easy whack okay so that should](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m16s)



[take care of that one unused dialogue](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m21s)



[closing event arcs constructors okay](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m25s)



[let's see here so some of these guys are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m31s)



[apparently not being referenced anymore](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m34s)



[which ones are they](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m37s)



[come on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m41s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m45s)



[Colon's you are failing me I really like](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m46s)



[it when you show me these constructors](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m51s)



[never used Thank You resharper you have](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m56s)



[saved me okay so that goes away that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h30m58s)



[goes away closing event args cancel](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m04s)



[that's a parameter session great those](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m12s)



[ones are now unused let's see material](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m19s)



[design combo box column let's just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m21s)



[change all the things while we're at it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m27s)



[material design combo box column so this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m31s)



[is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m35s)



[this is going to get interesting here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m38s)



[from a c-sharp perspective](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m40s)



[do let's see rename usages what exists](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m48s)



[in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h31m59s)



[these are string literals so that one's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m05s)



[auto-generated from show me the sam'l so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m08s)



[I don't care about that this is in a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m11s)



[generated file so I definitely don't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m18s)



[care about that so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m20s)



[ignore those string literals go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m22s)



[resharper go rename all the things for](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m27s)



[me which great](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m29s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m39s)



[no I think those already did get renamed](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m45s)



[for me visual studio I appreciate you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m47s)



[asking though I appreciate you asking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m50s)



[good and gets shows it as just a rename](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h32m57s)



[not and a delete and an ADD sometimes if](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m00s)



[you make changes in the file](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m05s)



[it gets very confused but thank goodness](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m07s)



[that is fixed okay next on the chopping](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m10s)



[block that's done that's done that's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m13s)



[done](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m17s)



[obsolete members and smart hint okay so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m18s)



[do be aware that this does mean that for](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m23s)



[people running on the preview nuga](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m26s)



[package breaking changes are coming so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m29s)



[content empty name content non-empty](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m33s)



[name let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m35s)



[these guys must be unused just gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m39s)



[confirm that I realized they've been](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m46s)



[flagged as obsolete but what this should](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m49s)



[mean is that there is nothing in the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m54s)



[template using these names](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h33m57s)



[thinking thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m07s)



[thinking probably look it up just as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m09s)



[quick since I realized that's looking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m11s)



[across all the files and I really only](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m15s)



[care to look in one it's really just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m17s)



[content being content not empty are they](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m23s)



[the two that we care about yep](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m27s)



[so don't exist there don't exist there](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m34s)



[so the the caveat to this being that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m42s)



[you're doing something with them now I'm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m46s)



[broken but those the the control itself](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m50s)



[isn't doing anything with them so it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m54s)



[doesn't make a big difference Oh while](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m56s)



[we're in here let's just add some](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m58s)



[pattern matching](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h34m59s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m02s)



[let's see what are you talking about Oh](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m08s)



[dispatcher potentially no yeah yep it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m12s)



[might be not gonna address that right](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m17s)



[now okay so there's that how it helper](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m19s)



[methods let's go and get rid of those](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m25s)



[too](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m27s)



[what did we whack the pilot helper](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m35s)



[already](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m37s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m41s)



[no spelling just matters so these ones](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m47s)



[are going to be interesting because I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m52s)



[believe this is going to these are still](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m54s)



[in use by the demo app which means we](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h35m56s)



[will have to know it's in use by unit](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m03s)



[tests that need to go away and place](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m08s)



[palette is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m14s)



[interesting maybe we already fixed the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m22s)



[well let's just start walking if the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m32s)



[demo apps gonna break we'll know in a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m34s)



[minute](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m37s)



[so maybe we already updated all of these](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m39s)



[something the back of my head is making](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m43s)



[me think that I did it on a live stream](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m45s)



[I can never remember if that was the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m47s)



[demo app or something else so let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m49s)



[that means this is gone](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m52s)



[and palette helper becomes get theme set](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m54s)



[theme as it should be simple](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h36m58s)



[straightforward not a lot of complexity](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m03s)



[needs to be here let's just do a compile](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m06s)



[real quick and make sure we haven't lost](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m08s)



[anything valuable](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m11s)



[some point I need to take a look at the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m23s)



[compile times and see if there's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m25s)



[anything I can do to speed these up](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m26s)



[because it would be nice if this ran out](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m28s)



[teeny bit faster](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m29s)



[I realize it's doing multi targeting and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m31s)



[it's having to compile multiple things](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m34s)



[part of me wants to change it up so that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m36s)



[on debug mode it only compiles one but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m38s)



[then the question is do you only compile](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m41s)



[the core the framework side I kind of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m43s)



[want both I want to know if I break both](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m46s)



[yeah I can't decide](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m50s)



[okay well that's thinking about it let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m52s)



[look up our next let's find our next one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m54s)



[hop up mode to click on pop-up box so I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h37m57s)



[believe that's going to be here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m05s)



[themes pop up box so let's see here -](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m07s)



[that's pop up box button](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m17s)



[Papa mode I don't see a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m28s)



[so I floating action pop up so there is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m39s)



[a question on let's see up a box the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m42s)



[thing is this one has a key what is the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m50s)



[default what is the default pop-up box](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m53s)



[template because this one the eye can](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h38m56s)



[see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m01s)



[leaving it we'll see let's check out the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m01s)



[pop-up box box password box](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m06s)



[ooh oh these we only broke the unit](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m12s)



[tests perfect and I know I'm gonna fix](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m19s)



[these unit tests these are not useful](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m23s)



[unit tests](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m27s)



[I'm just gonna get rid of them](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m32s)



[and I believe down here we are going to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m36s)



[go one step further I'm going to remove](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m39s)



[those references as well](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m48s)



[I don't think we are using](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h39m55s)



[any of the mocking libraries anywhere in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m01s)



[here and I think that's okay I don't see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m04s)



[a huge need for the mocking libraries in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m10s)



[this project currently they were only](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m14s)



[being used to effectively assert that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m18s)



[the palette helper would work with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m20s)



[various mocking libraries let's see when](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m24s)



[you look at that analyzer for the win](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m27s)



[come on give me give me your analyzed](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m36s)



[don't don't think too hard I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m39s)



[sure you you want to suggest that I do](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m43s)



[assert false there's there's my light](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m45s)



[bulb use assert false which I believe](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m50s)



[it's the same suggestion here oh I guess](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m55s)



[assert true in this case great wonderful](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h40m59s)



[wonderful wonderful ok so there's that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m02s)



[great yeah so we are we aren't using any](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m09s)



[of the mocking library so I'm taking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m11s)



[those out they do not need to be there](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m13s)



[because the unit test that asserts that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m18s)



[the mocking library works says it's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m20s)



[designed is it's not our job so pop a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m22s)



[box defaults mouse over eager so let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m25s)



[go start with the pop-up box itself](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m30s)



[and let's look at pop-up mode I'll put](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m38s)



[content content template is pop-up open](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m42s)



[stays open placement mode pop-up mode](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m47s)



[that's what I'm looking for so name of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h41m52s)



[default of pop-up mode which I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m01s)



[okay so the default is going to be click](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m04s)



[just fine so then the question becomes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m07s)



[why are you set to overeager](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m12s)



[so what we want to look at is defaults](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m20s)



[and lMNO P there's not one set there so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m24s)



[it must be set here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m31s)



[see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m37s)



[to do X key X key](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m43s)



[x QQ words the default one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h42m52s)



[it's set up with the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m02s)



[oh I'm gonna fix a spelling error while](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m16s)



[I'm in here real quick](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m19s)

[that was resharpen built-in Rhys Peller](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m28s)



[picking up that spelling mistake](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m33s)



[and that's just that's just British](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m39s)



[English I don't care it's much about](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m43s)



[that okay so the question comes let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m47s)



[see pop-up box this should be the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h43m55s)



[default one what's interesting to me is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m00s)



[this doesn't appear to be this way](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m03s)



[anymore](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m07s)



[why am I feeling confused I expected to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m13s)



[see pop up mode](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m16s)



[there's pop up mode they're set to mouse](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m29s)



[over eager](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m31s)



[and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m37s)



[this guy we've got some data triggers](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m39s)



[watching for and changing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m42s)



[I mean actually pop a box interesting so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h44m58s)



[it really only is this one let's go back](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m01s)



[to the demo up then because now I'm now](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m06s)



[I'm curious I want to make sure that I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m08s)



[know exactly the startup object](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m10s)



[I assume this guy must be picking this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m13s)



[up I'm gonna actually reject this change](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m15s)



[I know I'm the one who put it in and but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m23s)



[I'm looking at it closer I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m26s)



[change it going to change it what is the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m31s)



[is it just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m38s)



[that it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m43s)



[now remember the markdown syntax for](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m45s)



[strike-out you know what deletion works](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m50s)



[just as well update comment okay so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m52s)



[flipper and card changing their default](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h45m56s)



[vertical alignment so let's start with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m00s)



[card because see it's a vertical](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m03s)



[alignment stretch which I believe I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m09s)



[don't need to do because that is the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m16s)



[default of a content control so we're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m18s)



[just going to whack it and flipper](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m20s)



[this one this one I'm actually](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m32s)



[interested in in checking because the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m34s)



[the flipper uses the WPF 3d stuff and so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m37s)



[there's a very real being used go ahead](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m41s)



[and kill it there's a very real chance](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m43s)



[that this may not work quite right](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m46s)



[simply because it has to do some](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m51s)



[measuring of the control and it really](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m55s)



[really really wants a fixed size so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h46m57s)



[we're gonna test this real quick and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m00s)



[verify that this works and then I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m02s)



[we'll just do this massive commit that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m05s)



[breaks a whole bunch of stuff I will](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m07s)



[want to leave this open because the one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m13s)



[thing we haven't gotten to yet is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m15s)



[building and testing out this one here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m19s)



[because this is a very good change and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m23s)



[apparently several other people agree so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m26s)



[we're going to this will need to get](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m29s)



[fixed but at least we can check off a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m32s)



[bunch of these items which will be nice](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m37s)



[okay fire this up and let's take a look](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m41s)



[at this and then we'll have quite a few](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m43s)



[changes in this next preview release so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m46s)



[anybody who's grabbing dotnet core 3](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m50s)



[stuff make sure you're on the preview](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m53s)



[nougat package do be aware the MA app](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m55s)



[support is still not in I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h47m57s)



[dragging my feet sort of hoping that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m00s)



[they release their - Oh stuff soonish](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m02s)



[that way I can then follow close on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m06s)



[their heels with the integration library](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m09s)



[just kick this whole three oh release](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m12s)



[out the door at the same time or close](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m14s)



[behind them that is sort of my goal but](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m17s)



[if you just want to use the material](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m23s)



[design in zamel library proper without](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m25s)



[my apps it should work just fine on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m29s)



[dotnet core this demo app is actually](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m31s)



[now using dotnet core itself so huzzah](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m34s)



[that's sort of proof proof is in the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m39s)



[pudding that this thing it does work](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m42s)



[okay so let's go we got some](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m46s)



[verification to do real quick so let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m48s)



[see buttons toggles in the fields](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m54s)



[Pickers chips cards](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h48m56s)



[okay so this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m00s)



[that was](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m06s)



[that was a little interesting](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m10s)



[kind of want to come back and try that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m17s)



[again so the flipper is clearly working](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m18s)



[fine and the card works fine which the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m21s)



[card I'm not exactly shocked at it's the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m24s)



[flipper that that worries me and I kind](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m26s)



[of want to go back and see if that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m30s)



[really did work let's see if we just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m33s)



[back out and back in I kept trying to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m38s)



[remember how this thing does its layout](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m40s)



[Oh wrong click let's try that again you](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m44s)



[get smaller down there](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h49m50s)



[yeah so you need an EXO this one here so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m00s)



[this is one of those things because this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m05s)



[guy is now allowing himself to stretch](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m07s)



[to feel to fill the sighs he's not](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m10s)



[sizing down to his content he's sizing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m14s)



[up to his container which is a little](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m16s)



[more normal for a WPF control this guy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m19s)



[here on the demo app is going to need](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m25s)



[one so which which control is this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m27s)



[resizing flipper blah blah blah okay so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m32s)



[let's see if we open up this guy we go](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m35s)



[cards should just be able to go resizing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m38s)



[see flipper](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m46s)



[vertical alignment it stopped](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h50m55s)



[that should](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m01s)



[fix it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m06s)



[great and it seems that seems much](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m11s)



[better now they will size to their](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m16s)



[content appropriately great okay and so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m21s)



[if you do have a flipper that you're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m25s)



[relying on the default of vertical](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m29s)



[alignment if you don't like the new](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m31s)



[default of stretch just set it back to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m33s)



[top you'll go back to normal or at least](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m35s)



[back to where you were that should fix](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m37s)



[that while we were in here let's test a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m40s)



[couple more things so that was the cards](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m43s)



[and the flipper let's take a look at the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m45s)



[snack bar did you do do do do do do do](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m49s)



[do do](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m54s)



[snack bar an example seven was the one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m54s)



[with the timing so for five seconds](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h51m58s)



[thinking thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m07s)



[thinking thinking okay I felt like five](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m09s)



[ish seconds let's go one second Joe Hey](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m12s)



[looks like a champ](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m18s)



[works like a champ that was awesome](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m20s)



[okay here so that was the snack bar](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m23s)



[duration one scrollbars to expand or](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m28s)



[control so I don't know if the demo app](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m31s)



[is actually gonna show this one off ooh](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m34s)



[interesting so this this we probably](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m56s)



[want to address a little bit so while](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h52m59s)



[we're in here or just just changing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m02s)



[everything so let's keep going](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m04s)



[these text blocks is text wrapping wrap](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m06s)



[oh let's see I think what you can do is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m17s)



[scroll viewer horizontal scroll bar](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m22s)



[visibility disabled think that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m28s)



[so we might need to do a little little](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m41s)



[adjustment down here so let's go back](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m43s)



[that is probably not just not](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m47s)



[propagating change that change that that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m50s)



[does sort of break our or demo here and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h53m56s)



[I'm guessing a few other things so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m00s)



[material design expander to do to do to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m02s)



[do to do scroll viewers so I think what](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m07s)



[I'm gonna do because this was both of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m11s)



[these were set to auto yeah so I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m15s)



[what we're gonna do is setter property](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m17s)



[in here let's kill it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m23s)



[let's kill execution that's just gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m24s)



[annoy me with all the squiggles](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m26s)



[let's see scroll viewer horizontal](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m29s)



[scroll bar visibility value Auto](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m36s)



[same for vertical vertical great that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m44s)



[works that works are you squawking about](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m51s)



[nothing](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m55s)



[great and then this guy down here let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h54m55s)



[just clean up some white space Wow we're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m01s)



[in here we'll just clean this all up](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m04s)



[boom done let's see here so once again](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m05s)



[template bindings don't work with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m11s)



[attached properties so you have to do a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m13s)



[normal binding with a relative source of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m15s)



[templated parent I don't see a relative](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m18s)



[source lady parent and the whole reason](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m23s)

[binding appropriately so scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m32s)



[dot C is gonna be vertical scrollbar](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m39s)



[visibility](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m44s)



[and I am wondering about those defaults](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m49s)



[of auto on both of them I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m52s)



[the default should change based upon the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m56s)



[orientation so if the expander is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h55m59s)



[opening down don't have the the scroll](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m02s)



[bar in both directions so until so might](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m07s)



[be worth testing I'll probably poke at](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m18s)



[what the default WPF expander does just](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m20s)



[to see what that behavior is and then](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m25s)



[use it as probably correct enough or at](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m27s)



[least correct enough as far as what](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m31s)



[people expect because our expander](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m34s)



[control ism is a little weird in in what](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m40s)



[it's doing it's got some fancy animation](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m43s)



[stuff so that it you know it slides and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m45s)



[the content fades in and out as it's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m47s)



[going up and down and all that all that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m49s)



[fancy jazz but it's also doing it by](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m51s)



[manipulating the positions of items](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m56s)



[inside of a doc panel which is great](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h56m59s)



[because it does let the the layout work](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m02s)



[as you'd expect](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m04s)



[let's see if this at least gets that's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m07s)



[close because I really don't want to on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m08s)



[the expanders demo I don't want to have](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m11s)



[to come in here and effectively set a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m13s)



[width up on these guys it just feels](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m16s)



[yucky because you could go through and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m20s)



[bind the width of this text block to the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m23s)



[width of the expander but that that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m27s)



[feels wrong](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m31s)



[and I'd be a little shocked if that's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m34s)



[the way the expander worked on the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m37s)



[default control I suspect what it is](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m39s)



[is the only the scrollbar that's in line](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m43s)



[with the expand direction is set to auto](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m46s)



[and so we might need to add some setters](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m48s)



[for that you see here expanders](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m53s)



[expanders some point I'm somewhat](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h57m58s)



[tempted to alphabetize this just made my](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m02s)



[life easy so that that now works the way](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m05s)



[I expect so it disables the scrollbar](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m08s)



[visibility and doesn't you don't](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m12s)



[necessarily do this so I'm also thinking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m17s)



[that scrollbar visibility should be](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m20s)



[disabled until expanded so there's that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m24s)



[going on as well](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m30s)



[because so what's going on right now](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m37s)



[let's see so what okay so something is a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m42s)



[little off on this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m50s)



[okay so unexpanded](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m54s)



[changes the opacity of the heart content](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h58m56s)



[which is I assume the content control](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m01s)



[let's see our content which is the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m06s)



[content control let's just do this unand](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m09s)



[it thanks](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m13s)



[that's that's the visibility of it as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m19s)



[well and I'm wondering if this needs to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m22s)



[be bumped up a level](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m23s)



[thinking it does](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m30s)



[thinking it does](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m33s)



[let's see math multiplication converter](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m46s)



[this height is changing based on this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m49s)



[guy so basically as the opacity changes](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m54s)



[it's being used as a scaling factor on](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=01h59m58s)



[the height which is a nice clever trick](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m00s)



[same with the width so effectively as as](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m05s)



[it goes from transparent to opaque that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m08s)



[percentage scales out the width and the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m13s)



[height which is really kind of clever](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m16s)



[but I think the there's a fundamental](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m20s)



[problem here in that these guys here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m25s)



[really should change scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m34s)



[itself](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m40s)



[that is intriguing okay so I know we are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m47s)



[going to let's see here](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m50s)



[WPF default](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h00m55s)



[might even just go look at the dotnet](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m07s)



[Corwin on github control styles and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m09s)



[templates let's take a look at this guy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m11s)



[and see where because I'm guessing this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m13s)



[one must have twelve styles and](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m17s)



[templates show me the expander now it's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m20s)



[worth knowing these ones out here are](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m23s)



[being put forward as samples not](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m25s)



[necessarily this is what the actual ones](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m28s)



[are however these are pretty good](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m31s)



[samples so they're they're usually very](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m35s)



[close to what the real ones are so let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m39s)



[see style expander border grid toggle](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m43s)



[button content presenter header](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m49s)



[wait what](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h01m59s)



[property Hyatt desired](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m02s)



[interesting](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m14s)



[so oh there it is a confident presenter](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m24s)



[is inside of a border okay great](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m29s)



[this is the actual content here we've](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m33s)



[got a grid with two column definitions](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m36s)



[which means this is one that's gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m42s)



[expand horizontally to the right a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m43s)



[toggle button to switch it and then a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m49s)



[Content presenter to hold the content](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m52s)



[there I got you this is probably only](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h02m54s)



[showing one out of four I got you okay](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m01s)



[so mmm this is not helpful in that I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m07s)



[don't even see a scroll viewer yeah okay](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m12s)



[so let's let's try this WPF just let's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m17s)



[go find it I think it's like dotnet WPF](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m23s)



[yeah that one and let's just look at](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m27s)



[what the dotnet core template looks like](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m30s)



[for the expander control because there's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m34s)



[clearly clearly something there no I've](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m36s)



[only poked in this library a little bit](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m40s)



[so I'm not 100% confident where I'm](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m42s)



[going despite the fact that I'm clicking](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m44s)



[nice and quick let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m45s)



[presentation UI theme](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h03m54s)



[classic I'm a little surprised that all](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m03s)



[of these are just kind of loaded up with](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m07s)



[just like I expected to find a lot more](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m09s)



[sample files not just large blocks of](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m12s)



[them that is clearly not it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m16s)



[I should have looked real quick I think](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m24s)



[there was merge dictionaries in there it](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m26s)



[might provide a clue of where I need to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m28s)



[look next to see where let's see](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m30s)



[resource dictionary blah blah blah solid](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m36s)



[color brush solid color brush no](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m39s)



[literally nothing fancy okay now we've](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m42s)



[got lots of of stuff so let's just start](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m50s)



[with this is there an expander](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h04m55s)



[getting that it's still loading it's](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m01s)



[kind of hard to tell this is one monster](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m05s)



[of a file come on let me let me](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m08s)



[horizontal scroll oh boy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m13s)



[this is one](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m28s)



[massive file so it may very well be in](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m31s)



[here and if it ever finishes loading](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m33s)



[yeah that's a little better](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m37s)



[don't don't think too hard I literally](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m39s)



[just want the content let's see here a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m41s)



[digital signature oh boy](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h05m45s)



[so](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m03s)



[let's see component resource target](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m09s)



[sticky notes control this is just not](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m14s)



[quite not quite what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m19s)



[let's see a light normal color](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m23s)



[this doesn't quite feel like what I](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m33s)



[would expect this is let's just try this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m35s)



[expander let's just hunt this guy this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m40s)



[way this might be a quicker path to](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m44s)



[victory](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m47s)



[okay so only 13 files yeah this is gonna](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m50s)



[be a smaller one themes sam'l expander](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h06m56s)



[okay this looks like it's probably the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m02s)



[guy this is more of what I was expecting](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m05s)



[to find okay so let's let's take a look](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m10s)



[and see how they did it because the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m15s)



[default one clearly has a scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m18s)



[in it somewhere a header style so this](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m20s)



[one we should be able to just search](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m25s)



[really no scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m29s)



[interesting does that mean you're](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m38s)



[hosting something else perhaps that](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m41s)



[hazard](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m43s)



[interesting interesting interesting a](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m48s)



[better style left header style well](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h07m52s)



[regardless I think what I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h08m00s)



[is I'm just going to go back over to the](https://youtu.be/hYpb0GRnLGM?t=02h08m02s)
