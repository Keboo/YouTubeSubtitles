[00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:11,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h00m03s)

going here in just a minute I'm going to


[00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:15,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h00m06s)

see give people a chance to get in and


[00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h00m11s)

notify all of the Twitter's


[00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h00m36s)

see you live now for anyone who wants


[00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h00m52s)

let's see tf2 design


[00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:17,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m08s)

okay and I think we are good to go okay


[00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:23,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m14s)

ah see if I can get my environment going


[00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:29,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m17s)

here real quick let's see two little set


[00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:33,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m23s)

profile - I believe profile one there we


[00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m29s)

go and normal takes me back yeah


[00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m33s)

tools for file1 okay so hopefully that


[00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m37s)

is big enough for those people who


[00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:48,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m39s)

watched the stream last time we were


[00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m44s)

going through the new steaming library


[00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m48s)

or the new steaming api's it's going to


[00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m50s)

be coming in material design to 600


[00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m55s)

so those who want to follow along it is


[00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h01m57s)

the the seam API branch that's out there


[00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:10,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m02s)

and I actually went through and file


[00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m06s)

doesn't need to be there anymore I did


[00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m10s)

go through and deal with sinking off of


[00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m13s)

master and getting that all merged back


[00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m16s)

in so it actually has quite a few


[00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m18s)

changes mostly so that the button assist


[00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m22s)

pull request that was out there I got


[00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m25s)

that merged into master and then got


[00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m27s)

master merged into this naming API just


[00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,299](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m30s)

so that we don't end up with two


[00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m32s)

versions of effectively the same class


[00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:42,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m35s)

for those of you can may here I do have


[00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m39s)

two small children that I am monitoring


[00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:47,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m42s)

right now so I have to suddenly step


[00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m44s)

away I apologize and we'll be back


[00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m47s)

shortly but my wife is not able to watch


[00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m50s)

them right now so I've got the baby


[00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m53s)

monitor next to me so you see me


[00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:03,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m55s)

glancing over that's why okay


[00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h02m58s)

so let's pull up this pull request just


[00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m03s)

so I can remember where I left off and


[00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m06s)

we'll go from there because I know it


[00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m09s)

was very close to being able to get this


[00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m11s)

merged in and there's kind of a lot of


[00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m12s)

additional changes that are starting to


[00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m15s)

stack up behind this one so I'm very


[00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m19s)

much looking to try and get this merged


[00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m21s)

in


[00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m22s)

just so that we can get this going


[00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m25s)

and if people have questions whether


[00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m27s)

they're related to this or not please


[00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m30s)

feel free I'm I'm always open to


[00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m32s)

questions or examples


[00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m34s)

I know tide has been doing some work on


[00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,549](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m37s)

the the UI cleaning this up which is


[00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m40s)

leading into some of the button color


[00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m42s)

changes that Roberts knifes been working


[00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m45s)

on all of those I'm wanting to get


[00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,069](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m47s)

hopefully merged in here so we'll jump


[00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:58,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m50s)

over to the milestones the two six oh it


[00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:00,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m54s)

was the requesting feedback one and


[00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h03m58s)

there was a couple comments from Robert


[00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:08,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m00s)

on here that were really good that are


[00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:12,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m03s)

probably also worth addressing so make


[00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:15,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m08s)

that a little bigger and assume this guy


[00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,829](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m12s)

down I think I think Chrome's just


[00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m15s)

struggling due to how many comments and


[00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:28,229](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m17s)

all of the content on here okay so if we


[00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:32,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m21s)

get down where we left off before so I


[00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:35,979](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m28s)

had left this outstanding list of stuff


[00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m32s)

that's on here so the the things on the


[00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:44,139](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m35s)

docket for tonight are going to be these


[00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m39s)

three guys here I'm just going to start


[00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m44s)

a little document off on the side so


[00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m45s)

that I can keep myself on track and


[00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:55,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m48s)

focused let's see


[00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:58,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m51s)

and yes notepad the developers to-do


[00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m55s)

list of choice this one has already been


[00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h04m58s)

taken care of like I said with another


[00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m00s)

pull request that was already merged


[00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m02s)

into master when I synced it over into


[00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m04s)

the steaming API I basically blew away


[00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m07s)

the one that was already in there just


[00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m10s)

because they were effectively the exact


[00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:14,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m12s)

same class


[00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m12s)

I think the names even aligned perfectly


[00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m14s)

but one of them had comments and so I


[00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m16s)

went with that one


[00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m19s)

so yeah Robert commented with a little


[00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m22s)

more information as far as the ripple on


[00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:28,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m24s)

top which is great I kind of assume


[00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m26s)

that's what it's used for I do want to


[00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,469](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m28s)

go through it and and either verify that


[00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:35,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m30s)

it is something that we want to keep in


[00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:38,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m32s)

the core library or move it


[00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:45,199](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m35s)

so that's that's a to-do list for


[00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:46,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m38s)

tonight and there are a bunch of


[00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,979](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m45s)

information Robert if you're watching


[00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m46s)

this thank you I I have been watching


[00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m48s)

your branch and I need to go through it


[00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m50s)

in a lot more detail but a lot of the


[00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,080](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m53s)

changes that you're making in here I do


[00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m54s)

think I'm going to try and get merged


[00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m57s)

into the to 600 release because I do


[00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h05m59s)

think they would be good additions and I


[00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,919](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m01s)

at least a cursory glance I didn't see


[00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m03s)

anything that was a breaking change for


[00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m06s)

what was in there so then moving along


[00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:17,389](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m10s)

down here there was some cleanup as far


[00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m13s)

as expanding the styles because for


[00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,229](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m17s)

those of you who watched last time in


[00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m19s)

addition to just kind of the four color


[00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m21s)

brushes that we had before where there


[00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m22s)

was the primary dark mid and light now


[00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m25s)

rather than just having a single


[00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m26s)

secondary brush there's second or


[00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,669](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m28s)

English accent dark accent mid neck set


[00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m32s)

lighter or similar to that so


[00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m34s)

effectively six color brushes rather


[00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m37s)

than just three so and it also looks


[00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:46,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m40s)

like he had done a little cleanup on the


[00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m42s)

the demo page here but then I know ties


[00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m46s)

had also seen this in regard to hear


[00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m49s)

this comment down here is actually the


[00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m51s)

more interesting one for tonight so this


[00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m54s)

is in regards to the the color brushes


[00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:03,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h06m56s)

that we have in here so in WPF brushes


[00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m00s)

can be frozen effectively it's a concept


[00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m03s)

that allows you to take a mutable object


[00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m05s)

like a brush and then turn it into an


[00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m08s)

immutable object so that you can gain


[00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m11s)

the performance benefits by making it


[00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m13s)

mutable it means that all of the


[00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,889](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m14s)

elements that use that brush have to be


[00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m16s)

able to respond as say you change the


[00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:26,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m18s)

color in the solid color brush so in the


[00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:30,889](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m22s)

the seeming library specifically let's


[00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:39,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m26s)

just jump into this class come on you


[00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:44,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m30s)

could do a computer in here this thing's


[00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:48,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m39s)

all kinds of fast tonight there is this


[00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m44s)

set solid color brush method in here and


[00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m48s)

this is largely


[00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m49s)

based on the the old code that was in


[00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m52s)

here before but it makes this check to


[00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m54s)

see if the brush is frozen and if it's


[00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h07m57s)

not frozen rather than creating a new


[00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m00s)

brush just overwriting the original it


[00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m02s)

actually goes through and does a nice


[00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,379](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m04s)

color animation transitioning from the


[00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m07s)

backing color for that solid color brush


[00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m09s)

to the new color so that you get this


[00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,319](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m11s)

nice fade animation now the drawback


[00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,819](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m13s)

with that is then there's a performance


[00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,479](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m15s)

hit that comes along with being able to


[00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:25,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m16s)

do this and so this was in the original


[00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m20s)

code in the library but then all of the


[00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,509](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m25s)

brushes that were previously in there


[00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m26s)

were always being frozen and so the


[00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:35,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m29s)

question that Robert raises very


[00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:38,959](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m32s)

accurately is whether this should these


[00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,479](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m35s)

brushes should be frozen as well and I


[00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,969](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m38s)

think at least for consistency the


[00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m41s)

answer is probably yes and I think the


[00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m43s)

answer that were probably going to land


[00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:51,019](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m45s)

on a little later is whether we should


[00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m49s)

expose an option now that we've got this


[00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,209](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m51s)

better theming API to be able to go


[00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m53s)

through and allow somebody to toggle


[00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:00,829](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m56s)

that off because if you aren't making


[00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,399](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h08m58s)

heavy use of these the the performance


[00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m00s)

implications probably aren't that bad


[00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,209](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m03s)

again it's really going to depend on


[00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m05s)

your app and how much these are littered


[00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:12,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m08s)

over whether you're willing to take that


[00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,199](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m10s)

but I think potentially opening up an


[00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m12s)

option for somebody to toggle that might


[00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m15s)

be worthwhile but I think for now what


[00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m17s)

we're probably going to do is just


[00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m18s)

freeze all of these brushes so that they


[00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m20s)

line up so we'll add that back to our


[00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m25s)

add that back to my to-do list so that


[00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:33,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m27s)

we can get that going okay and let's I


[00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m31s)

see a lot of red but I think this is


[00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m33s)

just resharper red so I think a


[00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m36s)

recompile and we should be good to go


[00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,529](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m41s)

grab beverage of choice while we wait


[00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,529](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m43s)

for the whole solution to compile


[00:09:52,529 --> 00:10:00,089](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m52s)

that out of my way should have done this


[00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,159](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h09m58s)

compiled ahead of time this guy's going


[00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m00s)

to take itself for a minute so while


[00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,369](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m02s)

it's thinking about what it's done let's


[00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:13,919](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m04s)

go through and look at this ripple on


[00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:17,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m08s)

top option I'm not saying that it


[00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,349](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m13s)

necessarily needs to come out but I do


[00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m17s)

want to make sure that we understand


[00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:22,799](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m19s)

what it is and why it's going into the


[00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:28,979](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m21s)

library if it's going to be an API


[00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:33,059](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m22s)

change because as the name obviously


[00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:37,529](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m28s)

implies it puts the ripple on top which


[00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:39,119](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m33s)

which makes pretty good sense actually


[00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,279](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m37s)

here real quick we're going to just put


[00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:43,109](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m39s)

that off and I'm going to check and see


[00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,569](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m41s)

if I've got something else running real


[00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:48,959](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m43s)

quick just it just to get some stuff


[00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:55,289](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m45s)

shut down to make sure we aren't running


[00:10:48,959 --> 00:11:04,229](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m48s)

too hot good some of my CPU and RAM


[00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:08,119](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h10m55s)

resources back ok there we go ok and I


[00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:11,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m04s)

have clearly botched something so I


[00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:17,399](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m08s)

don't know as if I I did anything with


[00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:20,029](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m11s)

this after I did the merge back in so


[00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:25,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m17s)

let's take a quick look and see so


[00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:27,839](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m20s)

general I'm looking for the base class


[00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:33,479](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m25s)

it's probably broken which is probably


[00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:35,369](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m27s)

this one so bundle assist CS was specify


[00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:38,159](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m33s)

more than once in the sources parameter


[00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:41,519](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m35s)

ok so what this is telling us is that


[00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:45,839](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m38s)

inside of the CS proj even though I may


[00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,959](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m41s)

have only taken one of the CS files


[00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:58,729](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m45s)

there are still two references to it


[00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:58,729](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m48s)

inside of the CS proj so come on


[00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:08,959](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h11m59s)

what am I crazy oh that is the colors


[00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m06s)

project and not the main WTF project


[00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:17,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m08s)

that would be the first problem let's


[00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:20,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m12s)

back up and try this again project


[00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m17s)

because in general whenever you run into


[00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m20s)

a bunch of compilers like that it's


[00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m21s)

always best to start with sort of the


[00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m23s)

base level project fix those there's and


[00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m25s)

work your way up a lot of the upstream


[00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m28s)

errors will magically disappear as you


[00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:37,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m30s)

get stuff cleared out so button assist


[00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m34s)

there's one there and there's one there


[00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,029](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m37s)

I'm going to take the one that's up in


[00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,839](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m38s)

the alphabetical order and take that one


[00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:50,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m41s)

right on out okay and reload that


[00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:54,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m44s)

project and that's probably why


[00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m50s)

resharper was squawking at me as well so


[00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:03,079](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m54s)

let's go back to our ripple assist


[00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h12m57s)

that's where we want to be okay


[00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,769](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m03s)

hopefully it gets itself straightened


[00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:12,829](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m04s)

out the fact that resharper's happy


[00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:16,399](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m06s)

again is a good sign okay let's take a


[00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:20,959](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m12s)

quick peek because I what are you doing


[00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:25,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m16s)

to me tell me there's more errors one


[00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:27,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m20s)

failed seam manager assist oh another


[00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:31,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m25s)

one that I forgot to remove from the CS


[00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:35,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m27s)

proj this is one of the problems when


[00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m31s)

you do merges like that is occasionally


[00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m35s)

even though get is perfectly happy to


[00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m38s)

merge a file together because there's no


[00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m40s)

conflicts on the same line it doesn't


[00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:51,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m42s)

mean that the resulting file is correct


[00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h13m45s)

so third time's the charm I hope


[00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m02s)

because I'm really hoping that after


[00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m04s)

this to 600 release goes out the door


[00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m05s)

the next big feature that I want to make


[00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:15,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m08s)

sure that we get in is probably going to


[00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:21,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m11s)

be support for dotnet core 300 or as the


[00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:26,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m15s)

new name net 5 and so that will probably


[00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m21s)

be the next release after 2 6 so I don't


[00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m26s)

know exactly what version that will come


[00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m28s)

in or how we're going to Rev the


[00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m30s)

versions for it because it's not


[00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m32s)

necessarily a breaking change so we


[00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:39,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m33s)

don't need to go to 3 oh maybe just to 7


[00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m37s)

oh and just skip any point releases on


[00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m39s)

to 6 I don't know what we will see


[00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:49,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m42s)

there's a couple people who have shown


[00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:53,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m44s)

interest in doing it one of it which is


[00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m49s)

the the owner of the library James said


[00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m53s)

that he was very keen on getting it in


[00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m54s)

so he may jump on it first


[00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m57s)

the other thing that we may look at if


[00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h14m59s)

people are interested is we've been or I


[00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m02s)

should say I've been experimenting with


[00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m05s)

moving the project over to add your


[00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m07s)

DevOps


[00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:16,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m08s)

there we go compiled and happy and so


[00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m12s)

look at doing that transition nothing


[00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m16s)

against app there at various awesome and


[00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m19s)

wonderful their support has been nothing


[00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m22s)

but amazing every time I've had to


[00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:30,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m24s)

interact with them but as your DevOps


[00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:34,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m27s)

lets you separate the build and release


[00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m30s)

pipelines in a very nice way and I'm


[00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m34s)

hoping to take advantage of that to try


[00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m36s)

to automate some of this process


[00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:47,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m38s)

okay so ripple on top gets set there


[00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:52,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m42s)

which is great it is interesting I just


[00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m47s)

I just noticing that this isn't oh it is


[00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m52s)

a dependency property not an attached


[00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:04,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m54s)

property but registered with that syntax


[00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:08,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h15m58s)

interesting is it set to inherit that is


[00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m04s)

interesting okay look down here because


[00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m08s)

this is


[00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:16,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m09s)

where the magic actually happens so


[00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m14s)

let's just let's this line is way too


[00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m16s)

long for me to look at


[00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m18s)

jump down for a second here let's see so


[00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m21s)

panel Z index boolean to Z index I'm


[00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:35,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m25s)

guessing this is like a 0 or 1


[00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:42,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m27s)

conversion I was 2 or 0 okay so in WPF


[00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:43,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m35s)

the Z index it by default just back


[00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m42s)

you're back you're back arrow and of


[00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:50,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m43s)

times the Z index and wTF is driven


[00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:52,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m46s)

largely by the order in the zamel


[00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m50s)

however you can go through and


[00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m52s)

explicitly override the Z index if you


[00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m55s)

say have a control that you want to


[00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m57s)

write on top of another one which is


[00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h16m59s)

effectively what this is doing so in the


[00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:10,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m02s)

event that so let's see if ripple on top


[00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m06s)

is false this guy will end up being a


[00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m10s)

zero because I assumed that second


[00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m12s)

parameter is false yeah


[00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m13s)

so in the event ripple on top is false


[00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m17s)

we get zero otherwise we get if it's


[00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m20s)

true we'll get a two which means this


[00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m23s)

guy's the order is either going to be


[00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m25s)

zero which is what it currently is just


[00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m27s)

because it's the first child inside of


[00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m30s)

this container grid or two which will


[00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m33s)

move it down to here so this guy's


[00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m36s)

panels the index is being fixed to one


[00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m38s)

so basically whether we want to have


[00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m41s)

this guy float above or behind the


[00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:57,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m45s)

content which that is very very


[00:17:48,850 --> 00:18:01,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m48s)

interesting that is interesting


[00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:04,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h17m57s)

so it works because this guy is capped


[00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m01s)

here I'm just wondering if it if it


[00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m04s)

makes a lot of sense because this this


[00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m06s)

property seems very tied to a particular


[00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m09s)

template but at least in this library


[00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m11s)

there is only a single template for it


[00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,779](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m16s)

tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu so then let's look at


[00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:27,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m21s)

so that's that's the implementation of


[00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:37,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m23s)

it but where is it ultimately getting


[00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:37,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m27s)

used have we removed all usages of it


[00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:51,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m39s)

doesn't seem right I could have sworn


[00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:53,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m41s)

this was used yeah well on top okay


[00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m51s)

let's just do a text search real quick I


[00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m53s)

don't always trust the find all


[00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:01,669](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m55s)

references when dealing with sam'l


[00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:04,549](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h18m58s)

sometimes they get hidden so the ones


[00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:12,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m01s)

inside of the riffle and the ones inside


[00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:15,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m04s)

of ripple assist oh oh that that's


[00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m12s)

probably the difference so we've got a


[00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m15s)

ripple on top oh I think there's two


[00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,539](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m19s)

properties here that's what's going on


[00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:29,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m22s)

so we've got a ripple on top dependency


[00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:32,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m26s)

property okay so we can whack this


[00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:41,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m29s)

commented code but we've also got an


[00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:44,809](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m32s)

attached property as well ah ah I see


[00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:51,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m41s)

that okay so we definitely don't need


[00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:56,659](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m44s)

both and that's that's why it looks as


[00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:59,809](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m51s)

though got it so it's the attached


[00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:02,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m56s)

property that can that you can set


[00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:05,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h19m59s)

higher up that will inherit all the way


[00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m02s)

down the attached property sets the


[00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:12,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m05s)

dependency property on the ripple class


[00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:15,080](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m07s)

itself interesting


[00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,669](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m12s)

I wonder don't think we need both of


[00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m15s)

these because if we can set the attached


[00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:22,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m16s)

property on a parent and have it inherit


[00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:27,409](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m19s)

all the way down I think I might just


[00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:29,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m22s)

change at a minimum remove the


[00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:33,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m27s)

dependency property on ripple and just


[00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m29s)

act on the attached property inside of


[00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m33s)

the template


[00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:45,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m35s)

that way we don't necessarily change


[00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:49,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m38s)

purple why is this guy as Father's me is


[00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:53,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m45s)

to save bulb you should match match the


[00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m49s)

name of the property okay okay so that


[00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,549](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m53s)

makes sense so now the question becomes


[00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:02,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m54s)

where is you are used because I thought


[00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h20m58s)

we were using this inside of our new


[00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:10,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m03s)

purple on top


[00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:25,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m04s)

themes generic boy it is not being used


[00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:27,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m10s)

anywhere so I hmm I'm torn on one hand I


[00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m25s)

kind of like it


[00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m27s)

but on the other hand I want to keep


[00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:35,059](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m29s)

this pull request and feature scope down


[00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m32s)

so I think what I'm going to do is


[00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:41,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m35s)

probably pull this out what I'm going to


[00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:44,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m37s)

do it this let's do this real quick so


[00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m41s)

in get one of the ways you can kind of


[00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:57,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m44s)

just save code for example create branch


[00:21:48,020 --> 00:22:00,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m48s)

here ripple to ripple on top right is I


[00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h21m57s)

can create a separate branch which is


[00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:07,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m00s)

basically just a pointer to the same


[00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:10,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m01s)

commit and then I can persist my changes


[00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m07s)

for this ripple stuff inside of this


[00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m10s)

what we're going to do is we're going to


[00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m12s)

switch back to my seam API because get


[00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,049](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m16s)

cracking very helpfully toggles branches


[00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m18s)

on me let's go ahead and go back and


[00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m21s)

then we'll go through and I think what


[00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:32,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m22s)

we'll do is we'll take this out and do


[00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:34,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m26s)

this in two separate commits because I


[00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:42,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m32s)

think I want to make sure that I can


[00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:42,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m34s)

keep this so let's go in here because I


[00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m42s)

think I want this


[00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:49,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m42s)

request to just be the theme changes and


[00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m46s)

have some of this other stuff come along


[00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m49s)

later


[00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m50s)

that way we can evaluate that separate


[00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m52s)

Pro request and take them one after the


[00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m56s)

other


[00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m56s)

okay so clean up that extra whitespace a


[00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h22m59s)

keystroke for that for those people are


[00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m01s)

interested is control KD it's the


[00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m04s)

keystroke for format document but it


[00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:13,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m07s)

will clean up trailing whitespace for


[00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m09s)

those who care i I do term whitespace


[00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m13s)

visible on


[00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:20,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m14s)

I know sometimes these dots annoy people


[00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:24,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m16s)

but I also really really dislike tabs


[00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m20s)

and spaces in the same document the some


[00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m24s)

people can make compelling arguments for


[00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m26s)

when you should use tabs and I'm not


[00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m28s)

really interested in the tabs versus


[00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:36,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m29s)

spaces argument the one thing that I


[00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m32s)

absolutely cannot abide is both used in


[00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m36s)

the same document that just makes me


[00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:46,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m38s)

twitch okay back on topic ripple assist


[00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:51,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m43s)

boolean to Z index converter I think


[00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:55,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m46s)

this guy is probably the only guy


[00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m51s)

referenced so we'll clear that out I do


[00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m55s)

like how are you I went to the effort of


[00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h23m57s)

sealing it and I think this guy is used


[00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m01s)

by the boolean visibility converter


[00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:11,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m02s)

because I think he probably still has


[00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:14,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m04s)

references so let's see yeah I see two


[00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:20,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m11s)

references to it boolean to visibility


[00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:22,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m14s)

converter though we're going to come


[00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m20s)

back I think that was on my list isn't


[00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m22s)

it no we might we might end up getting


[00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m26s)

rid of this guy because that there's a


[00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m28s)

built in converter - WPF that


[00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m30s)

effectively does this so we might look


[00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m32s)

at its usages but let's deal with the


[00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m34s)

ripple stuff first so let's come back


[00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:48,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m37s)

over to here and I'll take you out of


[00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:52,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m41s)

the mix so take you out of the mix and


[00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:55,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m48s)

then let's look a little further down


[00:24:52,620 --> 00:25:00,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m52s)

I'll take you out of the mix


[00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:02,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h24m55s)

and I think this should clean this up


[00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m00s)

and we'll probably need to just come


[00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m02s)

back and look at that in a minute


[00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m04s)

what's this extra warning that's got up


[00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m06s)

here aa reference to hex grid just do a


[00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m11s)

quick search I have any more of those


[00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:25,049](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m15s)

did not realize I left this in after we


[00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:30,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m17s)

took the hex grid stuff out I can't


[00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:32,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m25s)

reference we should probably so this


[00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m30s)

generic is Amal is the only one that has


[00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:43,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m32s)

it so we'll do that and then let's take


[00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:43,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m36s)

a look at the find results nope this guy


[00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:54,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m45s)

should probably let packet manage this


[00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:56,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m48s)

file but I'm not going to wait I'm just


[00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m54s)

going to do it manually seems simple


[00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m56s)

enough to edit right there okay


[00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:06,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h25m58s)

there's all of that make sure we still


[00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,669](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m02s)

launch and run I am surprised I kind of


[00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:17,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m06s)

want to go back and look at the I wonder


[00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:19,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m08s)

if it was used in the in the the second


[00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m17s)

color tool that we ended up no longer


[00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:29,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m19s)

needing I could have sworn I had seen a


[00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m23s)

usage of this I thought it was in here


[00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,549](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m29s)

somewhere


[00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:41,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m30s)

look at that riff list on top is right


[00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:46,789](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m35s)

there this is why I don't always trust


[00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:49,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m41s)

it okay so this guy is doing rip list


[00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:52,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m46s)

okay so let's let's take you out of the


[00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m49s)

mix and let's just see what happens


[00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:58,049](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m52s)

because without that ripple on top the


[00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m54s)

ripple should end up slowing behind this


[00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:06,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h26m58s)

is targeting the palette button so what


[00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:08,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m00s)

is using this exactly so we've got these


[00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:15,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m06s)

buttons


[00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:17,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m08s)

just change button style change primary


[00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:23,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m15s)

foreground okay so these are all the


[00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:25,419](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m17s)

buttons at the bottom now let's get this


[00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m23s)

guy fired up and take a look because I


[00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:31,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m25s)

think what's probably going to happen is


[00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:34,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m27s)

that ripple on those lower buttons where


[00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m31s)

we were selecting the effectively which


[00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m34s)

palette color we wanted to edit that


[00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m36s)

ripple is going to end up flowing behind


[00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:48,419](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m37s)

the content I think we might be able to


[00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:53,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m42s)

adjust that though no it doesn't matter


[00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:53,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m48s)

let's look what is the content in here I


[00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:04,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h27m56s)

think it's probably the fact that with


[00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:07,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m00s)

the ripple behind this border is


[00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m04s)

effectively going to sit on top and we


[00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:16,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m07s)

won't end up seeing it I believe is


[00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:19,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m11s)

going to be the the problem so let's


[00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:31,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m16s)

find that guy out but I think we can


[00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:33,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m19s)

address that that's a simple six because


[00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m31s)

we can end up doing them is effectively


[00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,549](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m33s)

putting the button with the ripple on


[00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:42,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m36s)

top of this background brush because the


[00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:44,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m39s)

whole point of that area is to show what


[00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:49,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m42s)

that color is so that you can watch that


[00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:53,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m44s)

brush change let's go and take a quick


[00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,059](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m49s)

peek so the new color tool I'm also


[00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m53s)

interested in people's feedback we've


[00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h28m55s)

left in the palette and the color tool


[00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:08,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m00s)

oh we've got apparently when I merge


[00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m06s)

this I broke the corner radius stuff


[00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:12,309](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m08s)

really should have tested my stuff


[00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:17,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m11s)

before we just pushing it or straight


[00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:22,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m12s)

back in compatible type of corner radius


[00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m17s)

interesting okay so let's take a look


[00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,299](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m24s)

corner radius there where is the


[00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:42,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m27s)

animation button quarter radius zero


[00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:45,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m31s)

that's not the double animation so let's


[00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:51,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m42s)

let's go look and see what this is this


[00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:54,659](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m45s)

is a corner radius is there a nice easy


[00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:59,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m51s)

trying to remember I use this so seldom


[00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:04,179](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m54s)

is it basically just like the thickness


[00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:07,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h29m59s)

struct I think it probably is yeah it


[00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:09,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m04s)

looks like it basically the same as the


[00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:13,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m07s)

the thickness that you might set for


[00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:19,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m09s)

margin or padding which is different


[00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:21,669](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m13s)

names okay so let's take a look then so


[00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,059](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m19s)

this is all about the animation through


[00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:34,299](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m21s)

here because these are the the airs that


[00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:36,549](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m25s)

we were running into for now just whack


[00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,789](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m34s)

these style triggers just in the


[00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:43,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m36s)

interest of where did I start from style


[00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:47,919](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m39s)

triggers just in the interest of stayin


[00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:54,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m43s)

focused on the other one I think that'll


[00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m47s)

be that'll deal with one problem that


[00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:07,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h30m58s)

then will come back so it's like my list


[00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:09,899](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m02s)

is getting like like my list is getting


[00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,899](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m07s)

longer


[00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:19,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m12s)

go through and do this I think a little


[00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m18s)

restructuring of these buttons down here


[00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m19s)

so that we don't necessarily need the


[00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m21s)

ripple on top would probably be my


[00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m23s)

preferred option


[00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:39,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m34s)

because I think we can probably clean


[00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m36s)

these guys up


[00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m44s)

come on little computer you are really


[00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:54,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m46s)

struggling tonight


[00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:54,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h31m47s)

I know it's hard there you go


[00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:10,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m00s)

okay so yeah effectively these buttons


[00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m07s)

down here are the the problems so before


[00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m10s)

when you would click on these you would


[00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m11s)

see the nice ripple effect come out from


[00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m13s)

them and now I believe what's happening


[00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m16s)

is the ripple is behind these large


[00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m18s)

blocks of color and we're no longer


[00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:29,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m20s)

seeing those pretty ripples so we want


[00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:33,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m24s)

to fix that so I think this might be


[00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:37,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m29s)

which one is this primary selection so


[00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m33s)

we've got the live zamel editing we're


[00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:45,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m37s)

just going to see how much we can get


[00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:49,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m39s)

away with just in one shot though so


[00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m45s)

that definitely fixes it but that's not


[00:32:49,260 --> 00:33:00,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m49s)

quite what we were going for because


[00:32:52,679 --> 00:33:04,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h32m52s)

that is the whole background not just so


[00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m00s)

let's see what we got going on here


[00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:14,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m04s)

can't find a good place to put my window


[00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:19,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m06s)

we've got a grid with three rows so one


[00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:22,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m14s)

two three because the middle one is


[00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:26,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m19s)

double the weight of the bottom one and


[00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:29,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m22s)

the top one is just autosize so before


[00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m26s)

with the background down here which was


[00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:37,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m29s)

the look we were going for this whole


[00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:39,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m32s)

thing is the button but I think if I


[00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:41,309](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m37s)

look really closely you can kind of see


[00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m39s)

this white border around the outside you


[00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:47,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m41s)

can see just the end of the ripple


[00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m43s)

trigger you can kind of see it go out


[00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m47s)

from the mouse there so yeah it is


[00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:55,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m48s)

floating behind so ultimately okay so


[00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m53s)

that ripple was actually going over all


[00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h33m55s)

of them


[00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:09,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m01s)

so this whole thing allows clicking it


[00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:15,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m06s)

is an interesting problem if you wanted


[00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:17,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m09s)

to actually set these buttons on top and


[00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:24,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m15s)

let them flow through and have the whole


[00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:28,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m17s)

area be clickable it is an interesting


[00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:36,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m24s)

interesting problem so without that


[00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:45,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m28s)

ripple assist on top maybe I go back and


[00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:51,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m36s)

we just leave it in it might be the


[00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:55,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m45s)

easiest I don't think there's a cleaner


[00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m51s)

way to do this to effectively make sure


[00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m55s)

that your ripples are always visible


[00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:02,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h34m56s)

because in general of the fundamental


[00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m00s)

issue here like for example if I if I


[00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m02s)

just take this background brush off


[00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:09,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m03s)

right so we no longer have this now when


[00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m06s)

we click we can actually see our ripple


[00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m09s)

flow through it's light but it's there


[00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:24,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m14s)

maybe it's not light for you guys let's


[00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:26,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m16s)

just slide on my screen yeah I think


[00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m24s)

I've I've changed my mind


[00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:33,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m26s)

so let's go back our work and progress


[00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:38,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m28s)

changes here so let's go through and


[00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:40,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m33s)

undo a few things so I think we're going


[00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m38s)

to keep a couple of these changes and


[00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:48,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m40s)

whack a few others so you'll make this a


[00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:51,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m43s)

little bigger can i sim in - not allowed


[00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:57,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m48s)

sin


[00:35:51,320 --> 00:36:02,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m51s)

alright so soon big you should go here


[00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h35m57s)

we are ok so let's see that we're going


[00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m02s)

to come back to and deal with but first


[00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m04s)

we're going to get this thing going I


[00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m06s)

don't believe we need the converter and


[00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m10s)

I think we want to leave the ripple


[00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:19,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m12s)

change out I think it's just the ripple


[00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:22,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m15s)

sis that we want to put back and I think


[00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:25,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m19s)

we'll go through and change this but get


[00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:36,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m22s)

cracking is taking its sweet time okay


[00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:36,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m25s)

so we like that change let's see here


[00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m39s)

discard so we'll bring that back


[00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m44s)

probably actually should have not done


[00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:52,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m46s)

that bit but whatever we'll get rid of


[00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:55,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m49s)

that in a minute and then back down here


[00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m52s)

don't think we need the converter I


[00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m55s)

don't think we need to set her there but


[00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:07,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h36m59s)

I believe we want this binding back so


[00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:09,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m02s)

discard line okay so we will go back and


[00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m07s)

deal with that and then on the color


[00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:19,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m09s)

tool just make sure we set it back in


[00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:21,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m13s)

our style again so those ones style


[00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m19s)

trigger in this line here that we


[00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:32,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m21s)

commented out so we will undo that


[00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:36,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m24s)

change okay go away get crackin okay so


[00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m32s)

that should be that lives there that


[00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:44,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m36s)

lives there so this we have to clean up


[00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:45,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m38s)

because we no longer have a net realized


[00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m44s)

let me do all that we'll be booking so


[00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:50,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m45s)

it no longer has a property on the


[00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:55,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m48s)

ripple class itself to be the target of


[00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:56,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m50s)

the name of so as with most attached


[00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m55s)

properties we just end up with a


[00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m56s)

hard-coded string some people go through


[00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h37m59s)

and declare constants for these I don't


[00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:08,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m02s)

see the point of it most of the time if


[00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m05s)

the constant is only used in one place


[00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m08s)

if you need it in two places then


[00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:17,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m10s)

certainly declare it but I usually wait


[00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:21,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m13s)

until I need it in both places okay but


[00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:25,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m17s)

now back on our template if we go back


[00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m21s)

down here and we bring this line down


[00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m25s)

again


[00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:35,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m27s)

and then I'm going to bring the pass I


[00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:37,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m30s)

usually like putting my path first just


[00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:42,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m35s)

because it seems like the most important


[00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m37s)

property and when doing bindings in WPF


[00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:57,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m43s)

will assist to bind to an attached


[00:38:49,250 --> 00:39:03,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m49s)

property you wrap it in parentheses so


[00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:03,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h38m57s)

that it knows how to parse that properly


[00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:11,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m04s)

why not use name of ripple on top


[00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m08s)

because before it was working because we


[00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:18,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m11s)

had a dependency property declared on


[00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:21,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m13s)

the ripple class directly I don't think


[00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:24,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m18s)

we need the dependency property on the


[00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m21s)

ripple class if we already have an


[00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m24s)

attached property that's going to


[00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:30,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m25s)

inherit all the way down so on this


[00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,619](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m28s)

framework metadata let's just wrap this


[00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m30s)

because that's a long line to its


[00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:38,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m33s)

setting this inherit so that it will


[00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:41,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m35s)

flow all the way down and so if we set


[00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m38s)

this back up on our button it'll this


[00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m41s)

attached properties value will flow all


[00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m43s)

the way down to the ripple class and we


[00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:52,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m45s)

can just use use it directly but because


[00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m48s)

there's no property actually target for


[00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m52s)

the name of we can't use this because it


[00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:01,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m55s)

has property on the end of it and since


[00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h39m58s)

we've gotten rid of the property that


[00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m01s)

was declared on the class there is no


[00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:09,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m02s)

name of to actually be the target of


[00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:15,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m05s)

good question Magnus let's jump back


[00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:20,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m09s)

here exactly yeah so effectively we only


[00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:22,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m15s)

have that so I believe that should get


[00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m20s)

it back back up and working I think


[00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:31,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m22s)

that's that's probably the cleaner


[00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:32,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m24s)

approach to go through and do oh this


[00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m31s)

isn't going to work because we're using


[00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:39,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m32s)

a converter and the converter is not


[00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m34s)

there anymore so let's fix that


[00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:50,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m40s)

Kancil so the other thing is I don't


[00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:53,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m44s)

think don't think I effectively actually


[00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m50s)

need the converter I go back and forth


[00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m53s)

on whether I like writing converters or


[00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:03,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m55s)

whether I like doing things in pure


[00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:07,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h40m57s)

sam'l there are arguments for both sides


[00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m03s)

I really like sam'l as somewhat of a


[00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m07s)

personal preference because it avoids me


[00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:15,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m09s)

having to make the same logic multiple


[00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m11s)

times however I would say if you end up


[00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m15s)

using the logic in more than one place


[00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:23,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m17s)

it's probably worth consolidating it


[00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m19s)

into a converter so a bit of a judgement


[00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m23s)

call


[00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m23s)

but I think in this case because we're


[00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:31,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m25s)

only using this converter in one place I


[00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m27s)

am just going to do it in sam'l and


[00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:36,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m31s)

eliminate it that way it's a little more


[00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:42,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m34s)

clear and that is not the name of the


[00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:47,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m36s)

property target at canvas so we will the


[00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:49,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m42s)

default value of the z-index I'm now


[00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m47s)

questioning whether it does default to


[00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:56,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m49s)

zero or whether it defaults to something


[00:41:51,580 --> 00:42:01,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m51s)

very large and negative I think for


[00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:05,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h41m56s)

purposes of paranoia and to be explicit


[00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m01s)

we're just going to set it to zero just


[00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m05s)

to make sure some people wants to check


[00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:11,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m08s)

the docs on that and tell me what it


[00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m09s)

defaults to that was great


[00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:23,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m11s)

but we are going to jump down here and


[00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:26,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m14s)

do data trigger binding binding and


[00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:36,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m23s)

actually we're just going to just going


[00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:39,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m26s)

to snag this whole sucker I think we can


[00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m36s)

probably even


[00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m41s)

I'm going to put this here for a minute


[00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:50,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m44s)

but I think we can I'm realizing that


[00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:54,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m46s)

because this the way we set this guy up


[00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:58,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m50s)

I think we can get away with just a


[00:42:54,330 --> 00:43:05,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m54s)

regular trigger can't we because I think


[00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:12,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h42m58s)

I can just do the same type of thing


[00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:15,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m05s)

that I did before I can't really I do


[00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m12s)

this so seldom with attached properties


[00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:29,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m15s)

where you're doing the direct bindings


[00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:36,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m16s)

like this true why is that


[00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:38,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m29s)

intellisense is lost mind ah so you


[00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m36s)

don't need the print on this guy take


[00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:47,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m38s)

those off I think the resharper's just


[00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m44s)

lost its mind and is very confused


[00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m47s)

alright so because I am a panel because


[00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:57,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m50s)

I'm a canvas I don't need to fully


[00:43:51,930 --> 00:44:05,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m51s)

qualify the property name so value too


[00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:06,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h43m57s)

I think that works so rather than having


[00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m05s)

a converter that it has to run through


[00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:12,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m06s)

every time it'll just default the


[00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:14,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m08s)

z-index to zero and then if this ripple


[00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m12s)

on top attached property on the canvas


[00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m14s)

so not even on the ripple assist we're


[00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m16s)

letting that attached property propagate


[00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m18s)

all the way down to the canvas itself


[00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m20s)

since it's going to be there anyway and


[00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:31,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m22s)

then we will toggle it back over and set


[00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m25s)

it to two I think I like that better


[00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:46,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m40s)

this guy should just magically work if


[00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m45s)

this works I think this is probably the


[00:44:46,900 --> 00:45:00,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m46s)

way we'll end up going with the ripple


[00:44:48,730 --> 00:45:02,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h44m48s)

um ripple assist like I said this is


[00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,079](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m00s)

sort of the pattern I like doing a lot


[00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:07,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m02s)

where I end up doing my simple


[00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m05s)

conditional logic straight my zamel it


[00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m07s)

does mean that I end up writing a lot


[00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:13,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m09s)

more zamel it's a lot more wordy and not


[00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m12s)

necessarily always obvious to people


[00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m13s)

what's happening but if I don't need the


[00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m16s)

logic in more than one place or I can


[00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,569](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m18s)

consolidate it into a single style and


[00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m20s)

reuse the style in multiple places I


[00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m22s)

tend to like that better


[00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m26s)

again personal preference a lot of


[00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:35,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m28s)

people do the value converter approach


[00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:43,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m30s)

and it works just like ok so let's go


[00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:47,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m35s)

back here see how this plays out so I


[00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:53,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m43s)

click oh and it works the ripple is back


[00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:58,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m47s)

on top so so smooth ok I think I like


[00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:02,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m53s)

this approach best so then we keep the


[00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:06,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h45m58s)

feature but in a slightly reduced scope


[00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:09,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m02s)

I'm ok with that


[00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:12,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m06s)

okay so this is compiled and working and


[00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:16,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m09s)

so I'm going to take that off my to-do


[00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:20,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m12s)

list and I think the next guy up is the


[00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m16s)

corner radius animations that's going to


[00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,619](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m20s)

be the next guy to deal with because


[00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:29,819](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m21s)

apparently when I did the corner radius


[00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:33,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m23s)

stuff I broke it and that was not good


[00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:35,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m29s)

sorted ok so I'm in the wrong place so


[00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:39,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m33s)

let's close out all the ripple stuff


[00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m35s)

since that should be good


[00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m43s)

let's look real quick I while I've got


[00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m46s)

the boolean converter open since this


[00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:57,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m48s)

guy is only referenced here and this guy


[00:46:51,510 --> 00:47:08,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m51s)

is only used here I'm wondering if this


[00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:10,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h46m57s)

guy's used at all so he is used to be


[00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m08s)

able to toggle different true/false


[00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m10s)

values


[00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:15,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m11s)

got it okay so we're going to leave that


[00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m13s)

alone there is a built in boolean to


[00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:23,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m15s)

visibility converter so this guy's


[00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:24,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m19s)

utility is so I totally get this let's


[00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m23s)

just jump to one of those real quick and


[00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m24s)

we'll explain it so like in this case


[00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:32,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m26s)

it's being used to invert it so if it's


[00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m30s)

true we're going to collapse the element


[00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:37,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m32s)

otherwise false make it visible if the


[00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m35s)

true if these were values were inverse


[00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m37s)

and true was visible and false was


[00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m39s)

collapsed I would end up getting rid of


[00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,869](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m41s)

this because there's a built in boolean


[00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m42s)

to visibility converter straight in WPF


[00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:50,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m45s)

that you can use yourself and I'd end up


[00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:54,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m48s)

throwing this away but so this guy in


[00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,609](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m50s)

his default implementation is probably


[00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m54s)

bad but in this implementation works


[00:47:56,609 --> 00:48:00,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m56s)

just fine so and maybe this was here


[00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:03,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h47m58s)

prior I don't know if this was a change


[00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m00s)

it may have just been a small refactor


[00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m03s)

but regardless that's fine that works


[00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:12,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m05s)

we'll leave it what's this suggestion


[00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:19,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m09s)

here merge cast with type check oh yeah


[00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:21,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m12s)

so with full value we'll clean this up


[00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m19s)

real quick


[00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:30,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m21s)

so with c-sharp 7 we have what's called


[00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m26s)

pattern matching so the is operator will


[00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:35,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m30s)

do the type check and then you can


[00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:38,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m31s)

assign a value that will get it signed


[00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:40,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m35s)

if the conversion succeeds so this this


[00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:49,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m38s)

is effectively the equivalent of writing


[00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:53,359](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m40s)

bool full value if value is bool it's


[00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,359](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m49s)

going to be a very long word eversion


[00:48:53,420 --> 00:49:06,109](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m53s)

full value


[00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:09,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h48m56s)

gets type conversion value and then


[00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:11,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m06s)

doing the ternary operator on it this is


[00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m09s)

technically not quite equivalent because


[00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:16,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m11s)

this is going to end up doing two type


[00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:19,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m13s)

checks one for the is operator and one


[00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,799](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m16s)

for the direct cast so this is just a


[00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:24,079](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m19s)

very efficient way of getting both of


[00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:28,339](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m21s)

those operators in one and not having to


[00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:34,339](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m24s)

duplicate it multiple times over so we


[00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:36,079](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m28s)

will just key value so by doing this it


[00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:38,119](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m34s)

allows you to get both a type check and


[00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m36s)

an assignment in a single operation


[00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:44,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m38s)

rather than in two so minor improvements


[00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:48,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m42s)

but we'll clean those up while we're in


[00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:53,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m44s)

here okay so back in the color tool I


[00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m48s)

had broken Lee Lewis up here all of


[00:49:53,240 --> 00:50:02,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m53s)

these animations and so these guys are


[00:49:55,970 --> 00:50:05,299](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h49m55s)

failing because the previous button


[00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:09,319](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m02s)

assist that was in here if we go through


[00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:11,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m05s)

and look at the history had a corner


[00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:15,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m09s)

radius type of I want to say inter


[00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:16,369](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m11s)

double and so well actually was almost


[00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,809](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m15s)

assuredly done was given to these are


[00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:21,319](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m16s)

double animations so this was just


[00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:24,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m17s)

animating it and then it was converting


[00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:27,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m21s)

these into a corner radius further down


[00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:30,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m24s)

the problem is is now the the property


[00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:32,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m27s)

itself is a corner radius which is great


[00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m30s)

because it allows you to say rather than


[00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,309](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m32s)

just setting the corner radius to zero


[00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:40,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m34s)

you could set the corner radius to zero


[00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:41,839](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m37s)

two four six if you wanted different


[00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,539](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m40s)

corner radiuses on each of the four


[00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m41s)

corners right so top left top right


[00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:49,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m44s)

bottom right bottom left because


[00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:52,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m46s)

everything kind of goes clockwise for


[00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:55,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m49s)

what we have but it now means that we've


[00:50:52,490 --> 00:51:03,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m52s)

got this guy down here it's a bit of a


[00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:07,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h50m55s)

problem and trying to think I don't know


[00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m03s)

if there is a corner radius animation


[00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,579](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m07s)

come on


[00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:16,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m08s)

come on doner booth the speed of this is


[00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:19,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m12s)

absolutely astounding me because I know


[00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:22,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m16s)

there was like a sickness animation


[00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:26,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m19s)

maybe that was one that I had built at


[00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:27,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m22s)

one point point animation wrecked maybe


[00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m26s)

that's what I'm getting it confused with


[00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,079](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m27s)

know there's thickness animation so


[00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m30s)

there is a thickness animation but


[00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:44,859](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m32s)

there's not a corner radius animation


[00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:56,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m35s)

which is a problem so how do we want to


[00:51:44,859 --> 00:52:06,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m44s)

go about doing this so I think what we


[00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:09,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h51m56s)

might do is just cheap and I think we're


[00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:13,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m06s)

going to cheat a little bit so on all


[00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:15,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m09s)

WPF elements there is a tag property so


[00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:19,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m13s)

what we can end up doing and we're just


[00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:23,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m15s)

going to set this guy to zero is I think


[00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:31,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m19s)

we're going to just do a value converter


[00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:33,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m23s)

to go from double the corner radius and


[00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:35,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m31s)

we might even be able to get away with


[00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:40,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m33s)

not even doing the value converter


[00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:43,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m35s)

because I the type converter for corner


[00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m40s)

radius might just handle it for it so


[00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:47,829](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m43s)

rather than doing this where we set


[00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m44s)

corner radius value to zero just bring


[00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:52,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m47s)

this down here these don't have to be in


[00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,359](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m50s)

this order but I'm I feel that themes


[00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:58,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m52s)

that are similar should go together so


[00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:06,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m55s)

what we can do though is then bind this


[00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:09,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h52m58s)

binding tag relative source a relative


[00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m06s)

source self so we'll bind the corner


[00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:15,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m09s)

radius property to the tag property and


[00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:20,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m12s)

then rather than setting this guy like


[00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:23,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m15s)

this we'll just set the tag property


[00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m20s)

instead


[00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:32,119](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m23s)

and I think so the advantage of this


[00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:34,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m28s)

route is I think this will just work


[00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:36,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m32s)

with the implicit type conversions I


[00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m34s)

don't know I think it will we'll find


[00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m36s)

out but if it doesn't it gives us a


[00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m39s)

place where we can put in a value


[00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:47,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m40s)

converter to convert from one type into


[00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:49,609](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m43s)

another and I think this is probably


[00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m47s)

there's there's other ways you could


[00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:58,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m49s)

beat up these storyboards to make them


[00:53:52,070 --> 00:54:01,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m52s)

work the way we want one of which is


[00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:03,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h53m58s)

actually just roll our own corner radius


[00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,359](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m01s)

animation but I don't really that's


[00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m03s)

that's a lot more effort when in this


[00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:15,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m05s)

case we're really just trying to convert


[00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:17,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m07s)

from a double to a corner radius so


[00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m15s)

let's give that a shot


[00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m17s)

that might be the easiest option


[00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m21s)

assuming that it works obviously


[00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:40,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m31s)

that takes two things off our list and


[00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m37s)

then look at this corner radius a couple


[00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:47,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m40s)

of their small ones freezable brushes


[00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:50,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m43s)

and maybe we finally get this guy merged


[00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:53,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m47s)

any luck I'll get some if we don't get


[00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:56,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m50s)

it done tonight I might take a stab at


[00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:59,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m53s)

trying to finish it this weekend


[00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:02,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m56s)

assuming things go well but we will see


[00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h54m59s)

the family I never am sure how much free


[00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:06,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m02s)

time I'm going to be able to devote to


[00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m04s)

coding


[00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:19,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m13s)

come on little buddy you can do this boy


[00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:35,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m19s)

okay so let's take a quick look at this


[00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:38,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m24s)

guy so color tool there and Wow thank


[00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:43,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m35s)

this streaming is killing me so let's


[00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:45,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m38s)

see here um cannot on animate the tat oh


[00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:49,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m43s)

because the double animation is wanting


[00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:50,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m45s)

to animate a double property which is


[00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:56,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m49s)

the fundamental problem that we were


[00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h55m50s)

running into got it


[00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:17,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m04s)

or that is not quite what I wanted to


[00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:19,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m07s)

see is there an easy way to do this just


[00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m17s)

trying to think if there's if there's a


[00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:26,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m19s)

better option I you can always go to


[00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:28,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m21s)

like an object animation that just feels


[00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m26s)

hacky and I don't want to go down to


[00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m28s)

something with individual keyframes and


[00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:37,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m30s)

try to manage it that way that just


[00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:45,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m31s)

takes away all of this because it does


[00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:47,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m37s)

have a nice smooth feel to it because


[00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:51,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m45s)

before the property was a double and


[00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:55,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m47s)

what was happening is down on the double


[00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:58,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m51s)

assist it was grabbing that double and


[00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:04,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m55s)

applying it straight to the button which


[00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:09,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h56m58s)

was then allowing it to rotate sweet


[00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:19,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m04s)

life is home and able to grab the kids


[00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:26,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m09s)

excellent okay let's clean that up this


[00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:31,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m19s)

is interesting because it would be nice


[00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:35,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m26s)

it could go through and do something


[00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:43,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m31s)

similar with our own attached property


[00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:49,080](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m35s)

and animate it through that way I guess


[00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:49,080](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m43s)

that would work so one thought I have is


[00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m49s)

inside of the demo project so not


[00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m51s)

something that would go out as part of


[00:57:53,140 --> 00:58:01,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m53s)

the library create our own attached


[00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:05,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h57m55s)

property that then converts this double


[00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:09,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m01s)

corner radius into a corner radius


[00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:13,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m05s)

object because I don't really want to


[00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:16,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m09s)

change the type of this property I like


[00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:19,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m13s)

the the freedom to be able to go


[00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:23,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m16s)

through and set this on on each of the


[00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:26,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m19s)

corners individually but at the same


[00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:29,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m23s)

time it is also nice to be able to be


[00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m26s)

able to go through and animate these but


[00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:36,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m29s)

I think the animation case is probably a


[00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:41,089](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m31s)

bit more rare than wanting to set the


[00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:41,089](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m36s)

corner radius this is individually I


[00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:50,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m43s)

think that's what we're going to do I


[00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:55,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m46s)

think that's probably what I want to do


[00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:59,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m50s)

here I really hate to put extra magic


[00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:01,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m55s)

inside of the demo project because I


[00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,599](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h58m59s)

want it to be as simple as possible for


[00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m01s)

people who want to duplicate it but this


[00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:07,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m03s)

view here is a little bit less about


[00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:11,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m05s)

showing off the controls and more about


[00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:17,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m07s)

doing pretty color theming I think I'm


[00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:22,109](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m11s)

I'm more ok with it here so we'll just


[00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:23,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m17s)

create a button assist inside of here


[00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:26,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m22s)

it's going to only contain attached


[00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m23s)

property so it can be static let's see


[00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m26s)

here


[00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:36,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m28s)

WPF what is it attached property there


[00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:40,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m33s)

we go and so this one in this case will


[00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:53,609](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m36s)

be a double and we will call it about


[00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:58,319](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m40s)

uniform corner radius solid counts yeah


[00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:59,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m53s)

I think that'll be fine and so this guy


[00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:05,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m58s)

here what we're going to end up doing


[00:59:59,849 --> 01:00:07,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=00h59m59s)

then is on his property changed so my


[01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:09,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m05s)

naming scheme that I usually do for all


[01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:12,930](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m07s)

of these types of methods is on and then


[01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:17,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m09s)

property name that makes the most sense


[01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:21,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m12s)

to me so when this guy changes all he's


[01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:23,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m17s)

going to do is grab let's see we're


[01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:29,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m21s)

going to fully qualify this material


[01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:32,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m23s)

design themes WPF but can assist


[01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:35,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m29s)

set corner radius we will use the same


[01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:42,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m32s)

dependency object and we will use corner


[01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:49,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m35s)

radius with a uniform value of whatever


[01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:55,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m42s)

this is set to and I think we will just


[01:00:49,190 --> 01:01:02,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m49s)

default this guy to there so that it


[01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:04,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h00m55s)

matches not that I think it matters


[01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m02s)

because we're really just going to be


[01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:09,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m04s)

relying on this set operation to occur


[01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,869](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m06s)

and so then this becomes rather than


[01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m09s)

material design this becomes local


[01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:19,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m11s)

because it's now in this project button


[01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:23,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m13s)

assist uniform corner radius and then we


[01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:29,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m19s)

just need to make these same changes


[01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:33,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m23s)

down here all of that just to convert


[01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:37,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m29s)

between tags if anyone else has a


[01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m33s)

cleaner solution of how to do this like


[01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:40,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m37s)

I said I know there's other ways of


[01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:43,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m38s)

doing it but I'm looking for something


[01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:46,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m40s)

that ideally they're simpler for people


[01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:49,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m43s)

to understand that doesn't require an


[01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:53,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m46s)

extra class or doesn't require a ton of


[01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:55,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m49s)

extra zamel to make it work so open to


[01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:00,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m53s)

suggestions very open to pull requests


[01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h01m55s)

as always let's give that a shot


[01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:13,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m07s)

so exactly this animating material


[01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:18,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m11s)

design raised button


[01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:23,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m13s)

so it's animating the corner radius of


[01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:37,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m18s)

these buttons so when the mouse is over


[01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:39,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m23s)

or see I see so this is the okay so this


[01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:45,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m37s)

is once again those same buttons down


[01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:45,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m39s)

below so if we go to the color tool


[01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:01,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m55s)

so these guys here you can see that


[01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:04,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h02m58s)

animation and those guys go through when


[01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m01s)

you click on it shrinks in so that you


[01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:10,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m04s)

get that nice look all the way through


[01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m07s)

there okay


[01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m10s)

that's back to working it makes me feel


[01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:22,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m13s)

better


[01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:22,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m14s)

cool okay another thing off the list


[01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:33,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m22s)

okay so let's go back and talk about


[01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:35,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m26s)

freezing brushes so I think because


[01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m33s)

that's that's something that very much


[01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m35s)

needs to be handled up before we get


[01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:45,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m37s)

carried away let's let's commit changes


[01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:49,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m39s)

so real quick verify what branch I'm on


[01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:51,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m45s)

still on the seam API branch stage all


[01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:54,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m49s)

changes and we'll just look at look them


[01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:56,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m51s)

over real quick and make sure we make


[01:03:54,490 --> 01:04:00,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m54s)

sure I'm not as crazy as I think I am so


[01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:01,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h03m56s)

button assist while you get cracking if


[01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m00s)

you're going to be this slow I might


[01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:07,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m01s)

have to switch over to using Visual


[01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:12,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m03s)

Studio come on now when we just added


[01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:16,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m07s)

great see so this is the change for our


[01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:20,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m12s)

corner radius stuff it works great we


[01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:21,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m16s)

removed an empty border style great


[01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:27,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m20s)

looks good to me


[01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:30,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m21s)

let's see demo CS proj we added file


[01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:33,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m27s)

wonderful we cleaned this converter up


[01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:39,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m30s)

with pattern matching there deleted the


[01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:43,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m33s)

other one see remove the no longer


[01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:47,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m39s)

needed converter and fix the compile


[01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:51,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m43s)

issues of missing file and button assist


[01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:53,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m47s)

let's see here which actually means I


[01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:56,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m51s)

didn't realize this that theme manager


[01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:59,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m53s)

assist class was one of the things on


[01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:01,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m56s)

our to-do list but now it is gone that's


[01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:05,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h04m59s)

ah one last thing to look at


[01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:09,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m01s)

okay so packet reference I think this


[01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:12,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m05s)

was just removing the hex grid stuff


[01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,859](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m09s)

it is again normally you wouldn't edit


[01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:18,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m12s)

these files directly let packet manage


[01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:20,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m14s)

them white space clean up white space


[01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:25,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m18s)

clean up and formatting of the curly


[01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:28,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m20s)

braces removed the ripple on top


[01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:32,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m25s)

property in favor of just using the


[01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:34,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m28s)

attached property here's the fix the


[01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m32s)

naming of the region just so it matches


[01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:39,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m34s)

and then ripple on top and this is where


[01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m37s)

we had to switch it off of the name of


[01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:47,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m39s)

because we got rid of the property from


[01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:51,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m40s)

the class back to our ripple themes so


[01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:54,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m47s)

this was removing the hex grid resource


[01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:57,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m51s)

dictionary great removing the unneeded


[01:05:54,430 --> 01:06:05,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m54s)

converter removing the unneeded set on


[01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:09,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h05m57s)

the ripple class down here we got rid of


[01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:13,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m05s)

the panel z-index setter in favor of


[01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:15,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m09s)

just doing a simple trigger again I


[01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m13s)

don't know if this setter is 100% needed


[01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,099](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m15s)

but I think it at least makes it clear


[01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:21,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m16s)

that we're toggling back and forth


[01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:30,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m18s)

between 0 and 2 very explicitly so we'll


[01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:37,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m21s)

leave it great so I cleaned up ripple on


[01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:44,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m30s)

top you just use the attached property


[01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:52,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m37s)

fixed compile issues with missing file


[01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:59,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m44s)

references let's see fixed demo project


[01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:59,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h06m52s)

to handle type change of corner radius


[01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:12,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m00s)

sweet there's that and let's get crack


[01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:15,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m09s)

if it gives itself out let's just push


[01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m12s)

that up so and I think this ripple on


[01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:18,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m15s)

top branch I can get rid of now because


[01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:20,859](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m17s)

I don't think we're going to be needing


[01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m18s)

it anymore since we actually kept the


[01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:28,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m20s)

feature in


[01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:36,609](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m22s)

cool okay freezing brushes so resource


[01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:45,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m28s)

dictionary extensions this is where it


[01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:50,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m36s)

creates a whole bunch of brushes I think


[01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:52,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m45s)

I'm okay with leaving this logic in the


[01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:58,359](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m50s)

issue here is when we're creating a new


[01:07:52,960 --> 01:08:03,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m52s)

brush whether we should freeze it or not


[01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:08,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h07m58s)

and this is where I could very much see


[01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:11,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m03s)

allowing an extension to change this but


[01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:14,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m08s)

I think what we're going to do so this


[01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:16,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m11s)

comment is pretty meaningless at this


[01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:19,569](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m14s)

point set value directly yes that is


[01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:27,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m16s)

what this line of code is doing so far


[01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:35,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m19s)

new brush new brush goes there I think


[01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:40,089](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m27s)

we want to go do brush freeze it because


[01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:42,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m35s)

on the because what robert was


[01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:47,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m40s)

accurately pointing out is on the


[01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:52,029](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m42s)

built-in themes we can probably pick on


[01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:56,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m47s)

any of these all of these brushes have


[01:08:52,029 --> 01:09:02,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m52s)

this extra attach property put on them


[01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:05,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h08m56s)

where it I'm on navigate oh this is the


[01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:07,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m02s)

presentation options where it can


[01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,969](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m05s)

actually go through and freeze the brush


[01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:11,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m07s)

so when it's created in this resource


[01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:13,449](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m09s)

dictionary it'll actually freeze it so


[01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:18,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m11s)

that you get the performance gains of


[01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:21,699](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m13s)

having an immutable object before when


[01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m18s)

we were just directly assigning this and


[01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:29,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m21s)

I think this may have actually been a


[01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:33,009](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m23s)

bug in the old one as well I'm curious


[01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:35,859](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m29s)

let's take quick let's take a quick


[01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:39,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m33s)

gander at the old code because I suspect


[01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:43,179](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m35s)

this was actually suspect this is broken


[01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:48,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m39s)

in the current stuff and broken is a


[01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:49,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m43s)

very loose term I will point out broken


[01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,739](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m48s)

in that the first time you change the


[01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:52,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m49s)

color theme


[01:09:50,739 --> 01:10:00,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m50s)

it wouldn't animate but the second time


[01:09:52,690 --> 01:10:02,619](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h09m52s)

it would so WPF seems I am one level too


[01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:05,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m00s)

deep and it should be the pallet helper


[01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:08,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m02s)

I believe is where this code used to


[01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:11,080](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m05s)

live down near the bottom if I'm not


[01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:14,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m08s)

mistaken yeah so this is effectively the


[01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:17,139](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m11s)

exact same method as before except for


[01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:18,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m14s)

doesn't fall back to using the the


[01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:26,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m17s)

parent dictionary stuff has been changed


[01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:30,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m18s)

but it is doing this new value so where


[01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:30,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m26s)

was let's look at this so was new value


[01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:40,389](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m32s)

coming in yeah so it was wishes blindly


[01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:47,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m38s)

creating new brushes and not freezing


[01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:50,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m40s)

them so on the current on the current


[01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:52,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m47s)

library if you're doing these dynamic


[01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:54,639](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m50s)

color changes it probably doesn't


[01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:59,969](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m52s)

animate on the first time but it does on


[01:10:54,639 --> 01:11:04,659](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m54s)

subsequent changes that is interesting


[01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:07,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h10m59s)

and that is almost assuredly a bug so


[01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:09,159](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m04s)

it'll be a nice and fast for you unless


[01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m07s)

you start changing themes and then it


[01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:14,199](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m09s)

won't be and I shouldn't say well it


[01:11:12,429 --> 01:11:23,199](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m12s)

won't be then it will be mildly


[01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:25,869](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m14s)

different I think that was probably what


[01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:28,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m23s)

let me go back down to Robert's comment


[01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:29,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m25s)

I and make sure I fully understand what


[01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:36,449](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m28s)

he was saying but I think that's


[01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:36,449](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m29s)

probably yeah so this is what it does


[01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:46,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m36s)

the history of the function frozen


[01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:46,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m43s)

attribute was added for this reason


[01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m46s)

and the obsolete check if the brush was


[01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:53,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m50s)

frozen so I don't think the check is


[01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:55,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m51s)

obsolete because once you change the


[01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m53s)

brushes it was changing them to an


[01:11:55,489 --> 01:12:03,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m55s)

unfrozen brush so if you did multiple


[01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:03,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h11m58s)

theme changes it would then animate


[01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:14,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m03s)

unwise to leave it out yeah I was going


[01:12:10,489 --> 01:12:22,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m10s)

to call the freeze method on there so I


[01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:22,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m14s)

so once again Robert great great comment


[01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:34,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m27s)

is this and let's take a quick look at


[01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:38,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m31s)

his pallet helper real quick because he


[01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:41,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m34s)

was doing some work in here and I


[01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:46,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m38s)

suspect this is just a WoW change


[01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:49,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m41s)

version of the same yeah so let's see


[01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:51,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m46s)

what is he pull in here so he checks if


[01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:56,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m49s)

it it's in there and if it's a solid


[01:12:51,050 --> 01:13:00,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m51s)

color brush if it's not there he just


[01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:04,719](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h12m56s)

sets it otherwise he builds up a color


[01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:13,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m00s)

animation does the solid color brush and


[01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:14,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m04s)

equates the animation okay I think yeah


[01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:16,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m13s)

so I think I agree with him I think we


[01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:18,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m14s)

should be freezing these brushes


[01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:24,139](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m16s)

consistently and I think it would be a


[01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:27,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m18s)

great a great change if somebody wanted


[01:13:24,139 --> 01:13:30,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m24s)

to so by leaving this check in here if


[01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:36,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m27s)

someone else wants to you can go through


[01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:37,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m30s)

and copy your favorite theme colors that


[01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:41,239](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m36s)

you want so for example if you're using


[01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:43,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m37s)

amber bring in your own brushes that


[01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:46,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m41s)

have the same keys and just leave the


[01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:49,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m43s)

freeze attribute off I think what we


[01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:58,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m46s)

probably should do at some point is


[01:13:49,989 --> 01:14:00,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m49s)

allow for passing a flag through to


[01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h13m58s)

basically toggle whether this freeze


[01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m00s)

method


[01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m01s)

that way you could control if you wanted


[01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:10,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m03s)

your brushes frozen or not but I think


[01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:12,469](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m06s)

for now we will just always freeze them


[01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:14,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m10s)

because that will match at least the


[01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:18,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m12s)

behavior of what was in there for people


[01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:20,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m14s)

who weren't doing the changes just


[01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:23,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m18s)

wondering if that's going to if any of


[01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:26,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m20s)

you who are watching have feedback on


[01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:29,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m23s)

whether because this is technically a a


[01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:33,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m26s)

breaking change but if we don't do it it


[01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:35,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m29s)

breaks people who don't do theme changes


[01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:38,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m33s)

and I feel like the people who don't do


[01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:42,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m35s)

theme changes are probably the bigger


[01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:44,060](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m38s)

group since there's no way for wanting


[01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:46,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m42s)

this to behave consistently there's no


[01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:50,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m44s)

good way for me to both call and not


[01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:53,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m46s)

call this method so I think for now


[01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:55,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m50s)

unless unless I get feedback is we're


[01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:59,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m53s)

probably just going to freeze the


[01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:08,719](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m55s)

brushes and just take the performance


[01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:10,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h14m59s)

benefit using new brushes and I think


[01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:15,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m08s)

that will go in there and that's


[01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:17,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m10s)

probably a that is a good change so one


[01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:21,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m15s)

more thing off the list


[01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:25,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m17s)

okay so last thing on the pull request


[01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:30,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m21s)

list that needs to get addressed is the


[01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:32,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m25s)

shadow a donor assist class because it's


[01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:35,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m30s)

showed up and I did not understand what


[01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m32s)

it was being used for and I want to


[01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:42,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m35s)

understand it before we let it go into


[01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:47,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m37s)

the library so what do we got in here so


[01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:53,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m42s)

clean up some of these types so effects


[01:15:47,270 --> 01:16:01,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m47s)

render has a tag a changed callback


[01:15:53,140 --> 01:16:04,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h15m53s)

updated Dorner probably unlikely to


[01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:07,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m01s)

occur but I think I'd rather do UI


[01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m04s)

element well let's figure out what it's


[01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:12,080](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m07s)

used for before we clean up this direct


[01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:15,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m09s)

cast internal and Dorner property


[01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m12s)

updated Dorner


[01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:39,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m18s)

shadow a Dorner okay nose up this guy


[01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:43,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m34s)

see doc panel doc panel convert to local


[01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:48,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m39s)

variable just clean these guys up all


[01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:56,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m43s)

the way through and doing EQ you can


[01:16:48,800 --> 01:17:00,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m48s)

read only up always easier to read what


[01:16:56,270 --> 01:17:00,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h16m56s)

I can see what's going on that's my


[01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:04,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m00s)

curse


[01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:06,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m00s)

too many properties too many properties


[01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m04s)

let's break these guys on the multiple


[01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:12,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m06s)

line so I can see what's going on so


[01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:17,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m09s)

drop shadow effect


[01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:22,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m12s)

Chad's blur radius shadow Direction


[01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:31,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m17s)

color and opacity looks very similar to


[01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:33,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m22s)

some of the other ones share ranging you


[01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:38,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m31s)

can just be a lambda body member and be


[01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:43,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m33s)

done oh you have six references show


[01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:48,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m38s)

them to me internal on the assist class


[01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:48,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m43s)

okay so they're all coming from here


[01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:56,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m49s)

just do a quick search oh this is


[01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m54s)

probably why I missed that reference


[01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:05,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m56s)

last time I didn't have it set to entire


[01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:10,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h17m58s)

solution and it is almost good to know


[01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:12,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m05s)

Magnus thank you yeah it's I think it's


[01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:15,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m10s)

probably best to freeze them so that we


[01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m12s)

don't accidentally add additional


[01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:20,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m15s)

performance heads to people who aren't


[01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:20,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m17s)

doing the thing and changes


[01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:35,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m24s)

shadow a corner assist appears to be


[01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:39,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m30s)

unused at this point really well this


[01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:39,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m35s)

might be a very easy change um


[01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m40s)

because I do like I know this is one of


[01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:46,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m43s)

the things that Robert was talking about


[01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:50,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m44s)

that he was trying to get with his fancy


[01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:52,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m46s)

list which I do like but I do want to


[01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:55,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m50s)

keep this pull request adjust the


[01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:59,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m52s)

theming changes so we're going to just


[01:18:55,130 --> 01:19:07,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m55s)

take these two guys out for now and then


[01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:09,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h18m59s)

make sure this guy compiles and runs did


[01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m07s)

I tell you


[01:19:11,999 --> 01:19:21,479](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m11s)

Oh different class that should have to


[01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:25,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m17s)

removes right to remove which is good


[01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:29,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m21s)

now save the project so I should have


[01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:31,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m25s)

three edits there's the third one okay


[01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:32,579](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m29s)

let's just make sure we're still in a


[01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,869](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m31s)

good state and then I think we can


[01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:42,749](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m32s)

probably look at merging this pull


[01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:44,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m33s)

request which would be awesome which I


[01:19:42,749 --> 01:19:46,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m42s)

think would be great because again I do


[01:19:44,429 --> 01:19:52,199](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m44s)

want to get this in - at least the


[01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:54,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m46s)

preview builds so that we can get it get


[01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:56,999](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m52s)

it out there and have people play with


[01:19:54,929 --> 01:19:59,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m54s)

it and hopefully provide feedback before


[01:19:56,999 --> 01:20:04,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m56s)

too sick so goes live cuz I would like


[01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:04,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h19m59s)

some people to try it beyond just me


[01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,249](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m04s)

it's always one of those weird


[01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:10,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m06s)

situations if I put something together


[01:20:08,249 --> 01:20:12,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m08s)

for the way that I like it and not


[01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:14,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m10s)

always sure if it makes the most sense


[01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:16,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m12s)

to everybody so I I do appreciate those


[01:20:14,489 --> 01:20:19,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m14s)

of you who get feedback on you know


[01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m16s)

things that aren't working


[01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:36,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m29s)

come on come on what I got a I got a


[01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:42,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m33s)

look what is chewing up my processing


[01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m36s)

power let's see here I have a hunch it's


[01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:48,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m42s)

probably just the streaming stuff that


[01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:50,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m44s)

is eating up most of my compute power


[01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m48s)

some point I will probably end up


[01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:55,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m50s)

getting a little bit nicer machine for


[01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h20m53s)

this


[01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:18,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m11s)

hey Yeti let's see


[01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:21,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m15s)

Yeti man oh one I guess yeah I am


[01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:24,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m18s)

definitely a exam enthusiast you will


[01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:25,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m21s)

you will find me doing a lot of zamel at


[01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:28,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m24s)

some point we may end up even doing some


[01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:28,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m25s)

xamarin forms on this stream just


[01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:31,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m28s)

because I do


[01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:34,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m28s)

I do love my xamarin and being able to


[01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:38,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m31s)

take my WPF knowledge and bright mobile


[01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:44,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m34s)

apps with it is awesome okay so I think


[01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:46,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m38s)

we are probably in a really good shape


[01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:49,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m44s)

I do want some feyza I'm not going to


[01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:50,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m46s)

block this poll request for it but at


[01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:54,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m49s)

some point there needs to be a merging


[01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:58,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m50s)

or something done between this palette


[01:21:54,040 --> 01:22:02,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m54s)

and color tool views so those need to be


[01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:04,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h21m58s)

cleaned up a little bit so that we don't


[01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m02s)

end up with two separate two separate


[01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m04s)

things both acting on the same set of


[01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m06s)

brushes now they both work


[01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:13,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m08s)

interchangeably I will point that out it


[01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:16,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m10s)

is it is perfectly valid to come in here


[01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:20,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m13s)

and go look my my color changes here I


[01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:25,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m16s)

change it over here and my world


[01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:30,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m20s)

completely crashes it's not from the


[01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:32,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m25s)

standard swatches ah right because if


[01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m30s)

you use the new okay so I shouldn't say


[01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:37,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m32s)

they completely work interchangeably if


[01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:40,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m34s)

you start mixing the old API and the new


[01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:41,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m37s)

API together your world will break but


[01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:43,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m40s)

let's actually go back and test that


[01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:46,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m41s)

real quick because you should if if you


[01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:49,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m43s)

aren't using the the new API to set your


[01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m46s)

theme the old API should still work for


[01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:52,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m49s)

you so people shouldn't I don't want to


[01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,240](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m51s)

make people have to actually go through


[01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:56,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m52s)

and change any code that they have but


[01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:00,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m55s)

if you do switch your code to use the


[01:22:56,770 --> 01:23:03,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h22m56s)

new api's please switch it to use the


[01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:05,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m00s)

new api's exclusively because you will


[01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:06,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m03s)

run into some of these weird cases where


[01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m05s)

the brushes aren't exactly aligned


[01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:12,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m06s)

especially if you do things like I did


[01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m08s)

where you are doing random colors so I


[01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:16,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m12s)

should be able to go into the palette


[01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m13s)

there should be no problem for me


[01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:21,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m16s)

picking up these guys and using them


[01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:24,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m18s)

interchangeably right but then if you


[01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:24,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m21s)

switch over and do the new api's and


[01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:28,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m24s)

then go


[01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:30,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m24s)

back there could be problems depending


[01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m28s)

on what colors you pick because the old


[01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m30s)

api's are always going to try to query


[01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m32s)

your your current palette and assume


[01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:40,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m34s)

that the colors exist in the known color


[01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:42,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m37s)

palette which is not true if you use the


[01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:47,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m40s)

HSB color picker because you can pick


[01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:50,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m42s)

any color so again at some point I want


[01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m47s)

to merge these things together and


[01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m50s)

provar have to have a little or perhaps


[01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:56,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m52s)

have a little example where people can


[01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m54s)

see the sample that they need to put in


[01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:01,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m56s)

their app dot sam'l so just something to


[01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:08,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h23m59s)

make it a little bit nicer and easier


[01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:11,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m01s)

okay so I think check these guys in and


[01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:16,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m08s)

we will let the CI system check our work


[01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:26,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m11s)

and we will be good to go so removing


[01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:39,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m16s)

shadow Dorner assist from now unused and


[01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:39,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m26s)

not related lid it to the D mean changes


[01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:57,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m42s)

cool we will run through here and get


[01:24:53,500 --> 01:25:05,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m53s)

this guy merged we will have a much


[01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:05,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h24m57s)

better feature so let's go down here and


[01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:15,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m08s)

push and synced should have gone and


[01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:19,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m12s)

hopefully refresh the page because I'm


[01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:21,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m15s)

guessing this guy this is not showing


[01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:24,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m19s)

the latest commits from tonight so I'm


[01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:24,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m21s)

guessing it just hasn't gone through yet


[01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:37,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m25s)

and lots and lots of commits lots and


[01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:37,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m31s)

lots of commits history commits


[01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:43,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m38s)

lots and lots of commits more changes


[01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:48,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m41s)

and then we're going to let this guy go


[01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:50,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m43s)

and assuming that build passes so this


[01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:55,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m48s)

is I have started migrating some of it


[01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:58,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m50s)

over to add your DevOps just because I


[01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m55s)

like this view so you will notice things


[01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:04,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m58s)

are going to start slowly moving off of


[01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:08,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h25m59s)

that they're on to Azure DevOps so don't


[01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:11,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m04s)

worry uh if you see those changes coming


[01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:14,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m08s)

through okay so let's switch and do


[01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:16,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m11s)

something a little different for the


[01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:20,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m14s)

moment there was a question that came


[01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:22,450](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m16s)

through on the chat room that I was


[01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m20s)

going to look at and I thought was


[01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:27,880](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m22s)

rather interesting so we're going to


[01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:33,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m24s)

close that for the moment and let's


[01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:38,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m27s)

switch over to my example repository so


[01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:42,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m33s)

there is a jump back to my I get hub


[01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:47,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m38s)

real quick Oh hold up we might have a


[01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:56,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m42s)

problem something did not so what which


[01:26:47,410 --> 01:27:00,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m47s)

of these checks failed and let's build


[01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:06,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h26m56s)

failed well that does sound good


[01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:11,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m00s)

what did I do no not but we wanted we


[01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:20,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m06s)

wanted to see the errors please check


[01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:20,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m11s)

these guys out how do we do here


[01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:34,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m26s)

research dictionary default literal is


[01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:38,239](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m30s)

not available in c-sharp seven oh please


[01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:42,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m34s)

use language seven one or greater


[01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:46,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m38s)

okay so this will be an issue I will


[01:27:42,989 --> 01:27:50,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m42s)

come back to so basically the it works


[01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:53,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m46s)

on my box because I am using vs 2019


[01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:56,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m50s)

with the latest C sharp and the build


[01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:58,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m53s)

agent clearly is not so that needs to be


[01:27:56,670 --> 01:28:02,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m56s)

updated and pointed to the latest stuff


[01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:05,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h27m58s)

so I will get that fixed and I suspect


[01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:08,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m02s)

since it compiled and ran on my machine


[01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:11,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m05s)

it should work just fine


[01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:14,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m08s)

so back to where we were going


[01:28:11,269 --> 01:28:17,539](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m11s)

we were talking about github and a


[01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:27,659](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m14s)

question that came through on the chat


[01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:29,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m17s)

so let's pull this up and run over to


[01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:34,369](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m27s)

mine I will show you guys where this is


[01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:37,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m29s)

at so I keep a large repository of


[01:28:34,369 --> 01:28:40,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m34s)

material design examples and a repo just


[01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m37s)

sitting there because a lot of times I


[01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:43,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m40s)

found that people have questions or


[01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:46,829](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m42s)

there are certain techniques that I


[01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m43s)

ended up just repeating a lot when


[01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:53,639](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m46s)

people had questions and so I started


[01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:57,559](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m48s)

just compiling a list and there's quite


[01:28:53,639 --> 01:29:02,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m53s)

a bit here so it is github kibou


[01:28:57,559 --> 01:29:04,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h28m57s)

material design examples at the bottom


[01:29:02,429 --> 01:29:06,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m02s)

of it you'll also find some links to


[01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,579](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m04s)

some blog posts that i've written on


[01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:14,159](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m06s)

some introduction stuff some mvvm stuff


[01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:16,469](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m08s)

for WPF which i think is the most


[01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:19,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m14s)

valuable way to actually build a WPF app


[01:29:16,469 --> 01:29:22,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m16s)

I know some people disagree but I will


[01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:25,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m19s)

get off my soapbox so the question that


[01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:28,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m22s)

came through was actually around doing


[01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:34,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m25s)

animations specifically going through


[01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:37,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m28s)

and animating the card let's go through


[01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,180](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m34s)

here we'll close this one thing I will


[01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:42,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m37s)

show real quick is a lot of these


[01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:44,370](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m39s)

able to actually leverage utilities


[01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:46,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m42s)

library that's down here you'll notice


[01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:48,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m44s)

there's two kind of projects one of them


[01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:51,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m46s)

is just a project with randomly


[01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:53,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m48s)

generated test data because occasionally


[01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:56,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m51s)

you need test data to show and then


[01:29:53,670 --> 01:30:00,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m53s)

there's this other utilities one that


[01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:02,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h29m56s)

basically does almost like sam'l


[01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m00s)

reflection to let you go through and


[01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:07,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m02s)

modify properties because there's a lot


[01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:08,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m04s)

of times where we want to make a change


[01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:14,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m07s)

to a property that may not necessarily


[01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:18,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m08s)

be exposed and I always make sense to


[01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:21,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m14s)

expose every property possible in the


[01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:23,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m18s)

library so if you see something


[01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:25,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m21s)

referencing the utilities namespace it's


[01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:28,620](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m23s)

just this project down here I thought


[01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:30,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m25s)

about making a new get out of it but for


[01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m28s)

now if it's useful to you feel free to


[01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:34,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m30s)

just copy the code there's only a couple


[01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:39,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m31s)

classes here and bring it directly into


[01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:43,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m34s)

your your project I was going to go and


[01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:45,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m39s)

grab an example link of the animation


[01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:50,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m43s)

that we're going to look look to try to


[01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:53,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m45s)

do see if I can find it here


[01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:56,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m50s)

yeah so bring this guy over here


[01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:59,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m53s)

so the question was if it was possible


[01:30:56,190 --> 01:31:04,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m56s)

to go through and generate effectively


[01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:08,520](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h30m59s)

see if I can show it here so it's this


[01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:13,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m04s)

pixie Jas calm but as you scroll you'll


[01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:16,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m08s)

notice so let's see if I can get it get


[01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:20,430](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m13s)

to the bottom and get it to trigger


[01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:23,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m16s)

maybe I should just reload the page so


[01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:25,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m20s)

let's just relaunch watch these cards


[01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:32,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m23s)

when they first come in you'll notice


[01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:32,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m25s)

that they have a slight cumin good look


[01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:40,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m35s)

thinking thinking is it because I'm too


[01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:46,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m38s)

far down that's because I'm too far down


[01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:48,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m40s)

its relaunch one more time so you'll


[01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:52,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m46s)

notice they kind of slide in from the


[01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:55,019](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m48s)

side and then they have a sort of a


[01:31:52,949 --> 01:31:56,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m52s)

almost a fade on top of it as well


[01:31:55,019 --> 01:31:58,019](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m55s)

they've got this fancy little mouse over


[01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:00,869](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m56s)

effect which I don't know if we'll get


[01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:03,449](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h31m58s)

to that but I wanted to try and at least


[01:32:00,869 --> 01:32:06,239](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m00s)

replicate that kind of fade and slide in


[01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:07,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m03s)

effect on the card just to just to have


[01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:12,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m06s)

an example of doing that kind of


[01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:16,139](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m07s)

animation so in WPF all animations are


[01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:18,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m12s)

done via the storyboards and how you get


[01:32:16,139 --> 01:32:20,729](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m16s)

access to those storyboards is usually


[01:32:18,989 --> 01:32:21,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m18s)

through like a visual state manager if


[01:32:20,729 --> 01:32:25,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m20s)

you're in the middle of writing like a


[01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:27,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m21s)

control template or you can trigger them


[01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:29,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m25s)

manually from your code behind or you


[01:32:27,269 --> 01:32:33,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m27s)

can go through and do them with like an


[01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:37,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m29s)

event trigger which maybe and maybe


[01:32:33,329 --> 01:32:39,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m33s)

where we end up going here so shadow


[01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:45,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m37s)

animation not the one we were going for


[01:32:39,269 --> 01:32:46,739](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m39s)

I have not pulled my latest code so let


[01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:49,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m45s)

me pull it you just sync this guy up


[01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:53,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m46s)

real quick so there is an example I have


[01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:58,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m49s)

started for doing exactly that


[01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:58,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h32m53s)

so sync get the latest stuff


[01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:11,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m06s)

we'll see about actually doing that


[01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:16,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m07s)

slide animation in and see if we can


[01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:17,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m11s)

make it look nice and pretty at some


[01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:20,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m16s)

point I may have to start breaking these


[01:33:17,949 --> 01:33:22,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m17s)

projects into their own solution or


[01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:25,389](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m20s)

separating them somehow because this is


[01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:30,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m22s)

getting to be a very unwieldy solution


[01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:33,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m25s)

with a ton of projects in it especially


[01:33:30,429 --> 01:33:38,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m30s)

since most of these are unrelated to


[01:33:33,909 --> 01:33:42,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m33s)

each other okay so there is a card slide


[01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:44,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m38s)

animation project so all I did is I


[01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:46,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m42s)

started off with a just a brand new


[01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:50,139](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m44s)

blank WPF project and then went and


[01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:52,719](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m46s)

brought in the material design library I


[01:33:50,139 --> 01:33:56,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m50s)

pulled in the standard resource


[01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:59,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m52s)

dictionaries so light same default


[01:33:56,770 --> 01:34:01,449](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m56s)

control styles and then blue for the


[01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:04,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h33m59s)

primary purple for the accent color just


[01:34:01,449 --> 01:34:06,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m01s)

because I've been trying to standardize


[01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m04s)

on all the colors in this example repo


[01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:12,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m06s)

nothing other than me being a little


[01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m09s)

picky the main window itself is pretty


[01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:15,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m12s)

simple


[01:34:12,849 --> 01:34:17,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m12s)

we've got a grid with a button on in the


[01:34:15,909 --> 01:34:20,289](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m15s)

first row and then we've got a card


[01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m17s)

that's largely going to fill up the the


[01:34:20,289 --> 01:34:25,389](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m20s)

big portion of the second row to kind of


[01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:28,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m21s)

simulate that behavior the card itself


[01:34:25,389 --> 01:34:32,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m25s)

just has a simple pack icon and I'll


[01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:34,320](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m28s)

just set this guy as my start up and


[01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:39,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m32s)

fire him up real quick


[01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:41,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m34s)

it should be fairly straightforward and


[01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:43,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m39s)

so what I'm thinking I want to do is go


[01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:46,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m41s)

through and when you click the button


[01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:48,940](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m43s)

basically reach Ritter that animation so


[01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:52,389](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m46s)

unlike the web page where I keep having


[01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:55,889](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m48s)

to refreshed and to make that occur it


[01:34:52,389 --> 01:34:59,679](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m52s)

actually will go through and here I will


[01:34:55,889 --> 01:35:02,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m55s)

for those people who want it there's the


[01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:04,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h34m59s)

link of the web page in question I think


[01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:11,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m02s)

it's probably easier to see on your own


[01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:14,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m04s)

machine that on mine and come on little


[01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:14,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m11s)

buddy you can do it


[01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:33,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m27s)

so simple but when we click this button


[01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:37,449](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m30s)

we want to see this guy actually go


[01:35:33,949 --> 01:35:41,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m33s)

through an animate and do some fun stuff


[01:35:37,449 --> 01:35:46,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m37s)

okay so I think what we're going to do


[01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:51,699](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m41s)

is let's go through first and give this


[01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:51,699](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m46s)

guy a name so that we can reference them


[01:35:54,010 --> 01:36:01,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m54s)

and in the interest of simplicity let's


[01:35:57,889 --> 01:36:07,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h35m57s)

just go through and do this straight in


[01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:15,829](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m01s)

the I think in the code behind is


[01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:23,539](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m07s)

probably easiest maybe we could declare


[01:36:15,829 --> 01:36:24,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m15s)

the storyboard right here now let's just


[01:36:23,539 --> 01:36:29,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m23s)

let's just do it in the code behind


[01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:32,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m24s)

that's that's probably that I do try to


[01:36:29,329 --> 01:36:37,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m29s)

keep these examples whatever is the


[01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:42,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m32s)

absolute simplest I can get away with so


[01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:45,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m37s)

don't always take them as great examples


[01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:47,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m42s)

of how I would structure everything


[01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:53,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m45s)

because the intent is really just to


[01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:56,719](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m47s)

make them simple easy to understand okay


[01:36:53,300 --> 01:37:07,309](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m53s)

so first thing we need is a storyboard


[01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:09,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h36m56s)

and you'll have to forgive me I do most


[01:37:07,309 --> 01:37:17,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m07s)

of these examples so doing this down


[01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:20,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m09s)

here is a slight deviation for me so I


[01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:23,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m17s)

believe what we're going to do is begin


[01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:28,719](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m20s)

and I think we just give it the name of


[01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:31,789](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m23s)

our card to be the containing element


[01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:34,369](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m28s)

okay so the first thing we want to do so


[01:37:31,789 --> 01:37:37,039](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m31s)

on all the storyboards when they


[01:37:34,369 --> 01:37:38,749](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m34s)

eventually get to the end they have a


[01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:40,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m37s)

couple different things that they can do


[01:37:38,749 --> 01:37:41,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m38s)

and this is usually the thing that trips


[01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:45,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m40s)

most


[01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:48,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m41s)

up is if you animate a property when it


[01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:51,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m45s)

reaches the end of the storyboard it can


[01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:53,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m48s)

either stop and effectively undo all of


[01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:56,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m51s)

the property changes that is done or


[01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:59,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m53s)

could hold its values and in general you


[01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m56s)

probably want hold end on most of them


[01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:02,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h37m59s)

but it is worth knowing that if a


[01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:05,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m00s)

storyboard is holding a property at its


[01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:06,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m02s)

end value and you try to change it the


[01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m05s)

storyboard is going to come in right


[01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:10,040](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m06s)

behind you and set it right back because


[01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:14,780](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m08s)

it's effectively going to hold that


[01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:18,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m10s)

value right there so just be aware that


[01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:23,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m14s)

I think that's probably the only thing


[01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:29,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m18s)

we need to set as far as that goes


[01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:31,220](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m23s)

because there's various things for we I


[01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:33,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m29s)

don't think we need to set the duration


[01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:38,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m31s)

of the begin time we're going to do


[01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:41,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m33s)

those individually on the children so I


[01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:45,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m38s)

think that's probably probably good


[01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:51,350](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m41s)

enough for now so the next one I believe


[01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:53,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m45s)

is the children and we add a new so


[01:38:51,350 --> 01:39:01,640](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m51s)

let's see so we are going to start with


[01:38:53,960 --> 01:39:05,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h38m53s)

a double animation I think and so let's


[01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:10,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m01s)

take a quick look at what we have so on


[01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:13,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m05s)

this card just start with the simple


[01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:16,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m10s)

fade values so we're going to start its


[01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:23,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m13s)

opacity at zero and we will fade it into


[01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:29,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m16s)

one which seems simple to actually let's


[01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:32,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m23s)

pull this guy out pull this guy out and


[01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:40,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m29s)

declare him up here I think what we


[01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:40,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m32s)

might actually do is read only reward


[01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:44,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m40s)

you might just do this


[01:39:49,910 --> 01:40:08,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h39m49s)

think down here so they have a okay


[01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:10,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m02s)

global stayed I was thinking I would I


[01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:12,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m08s)

would go through and just basically


[01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:17,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m10s)

toggle and reset it every time but I


[01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:26,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m12s)

might it doesn't really make a lot of


[01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:30,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m17s)

sense because it does have a completed


[01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:35,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m26s)

event something was like an active check


[01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:40,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m30s)

to know if it's running or not begin


[01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:49,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m35s)

time Auto reverse name repeat behavior


[01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:49,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m40s)

speed as clock stayed give me


[01:40:54,340 --> 01:41:02,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h40m54s)

oh cool so at filling stopped


[01:41:09,809 --> 01:41:18,359](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m09s)

I also stopped we might try this we


[01:41:14,339 --> 01:41:22,109](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m14s)

might try this down here so from now


[01:41:18,359 --> 01:41:23,699](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m18s)

storyboard begin on card will go right


[01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:25,769](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m22s)

here okay


[01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:37,649](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m23s)

so double animation we are going to


[01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:44,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m25s)

animate to one and two how long do we


[01:41:37,649 --> 01:41:47,879](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m37s)

want to go so time span two from


[01:41:44,429 --> 01:41:52,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m44s)

milliseconds maybe animate it for 200


[01:41:47,879 --> 01:42:02,309](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m47s)

milliseconds okay so let's verify that


[01:41:52,949 --> 01:42:04,019](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h41m52s)

this at least works so done happy that


[01:42:02,309 --> 01:42:12,899](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m02s)

my capitalization is wrong so let's


[01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:17,009](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m04s)

click on it click button and the world


[01:42:12,899 --> 01:42:19,709](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m12s)

goes done must specify ATAR oh right


[01:42:17,009 --> 01:42:21,689](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m17s)

because we can't just say double


[01:42:19,709 --> 01:42:26,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m19s)

animation and not tell it what to


[01:42:21,689 --> 01:42:26,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m21s)

animate that does not make much sense so


[01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:45,169](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m29s)

that's the animation okay


[01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:45,169](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m36s)

so test the animation see where is


[01:42:48,909 --> 01:43:00,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m48s)

a property type oh it is


[01:42:53,070 --> 01:43:07,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h42m53s)

storyboard set target property and


[01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:09,480](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m00s)

opacity animation remember exactly what


[01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:15,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m07s)

it's on so I'm just going to do card


[01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:28,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m09s)

hasit e property Oh wants a property


[01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:28,949](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m15s)

path oh okay so name of car dot opacity


[01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:59,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m39s)

pass the animation I think this think


[01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:59,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m47s)

the fists closer okay nice fade in I


[01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:08,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h43m59s)

think so given the performance of this


[01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:14,030](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m06s)

not entirely sure


[01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:15,770](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m08s)

so from seconds actually does this guy


[01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:17,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m14s)

allow me to get away without passing a


[01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:21,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m15s)

duration because I'm wondering if I just


[01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:24,530](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m17s)

set a total time no because it's going


[01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:29,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m21s)

to want to hold all of them I can


[01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:32,330](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m24s)

probably from seconds let's just do two


[01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:34,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m29s)

so that we can actually see the


[01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:36,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m32s)

animation happen I realize that the


[01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:41,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m34s)

pasty change is going to be pretty quick


[01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:41,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m36s)

in the end but for here this will work


[01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:57,820](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m49s)

close up I think the other thing we'll


[01:44:55,060 --> 01:45:02,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m55s)

do I'll probably make our life a little


[01:44:57,820 --> 01:45:07,000](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h44m57s)

easier go from zero to one so what this


[01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:09,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m02s)

will end up doing is when we go and


[01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,950](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m07s)

begin the storyboard it'll set the


[01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:14,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m09s)

starting value from zero and animate to


[01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:16,870](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m11s)

one whereas if you just have a two value


[01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:21,790](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m14s)

it'll end up animating to one from


[01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:26,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m16s)

wherever it's at so it brings it in


[01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:30,970](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m21s)

great brings it in again much better


[01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:35,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m26s)

much better okay what are you squawking


[01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:38,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m30s)

about here oh it wants to do a rename I


[01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:41,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m35s)

think what we're actually going to end


[01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:47,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m38s)

up doing is just lowercase this make it


[01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:51,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m41s)

match okay so that handles that and time


[01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:55,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m47s)

span think we'll do make the 200


[01:45:51,750 --> 01:46:00,130](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m51s)

milliseconds is probably a lot closer so


[01:45:55,390 --> 01:46:05,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h45m55s)

now I'd like to get the kind of slide in


[01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:08,740](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m00s)

effect from the right so on WPF there


[01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:11,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m05s)

are two types of transforms there is a


[01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:13,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m08s)

layout transform and a render transform


[01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:16,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m11s)

and the the difference is a little


[01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:19,300](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m13s)

subtle but very important to note so a


[01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:22,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m16s)

layout transform will transform the


[01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:23,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m19s)

object during the layout pass when WPF


[01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:27,490](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m22s)

is figuring out where elements should go


[01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:29,700](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m23s)

the render transform happens after the


[01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:33,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m27s)

items been laid out a given its space


[01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:38,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m29s)

and so for example if you were to like


[01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:40,120](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m33s)

rotate an object 45 degrees in its


[01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:42,160](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m38s)

layout transform it'll get enough space


[01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:43,960](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m40s)

for that rotation whereas if you do in a


[01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:46,540](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m42s)

render transform it won't necessarily


[01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:48,850](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m43s)

have enough space however the render


[01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:50,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m46s)

transforms are a lot faster because it


[01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:52,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m48s)

doesn't have to cause a layout pass and


[01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m50s)

affect other elements as it's changing


[01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:55,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m52s)

so most of the time you actually want to


[01:46:54,190 --> 01:47:00,250](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m54s)

use the render transforms for just about


[01:46:55,990 --> 01:47:02,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h46m55s)

everything until the the thing that you


[01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:04,999](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m00s)

need to transform really should affect


[01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:11,420](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m02s)

the layout


[01:47:04,999 --> 01:47:13,280](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m04s)

but I usually try to design around not


[01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:17,059](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m11s)

needing a layout transform as much as


[01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:26,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m13s)

possible so we are going to set a render


[01:47:17,059 --> 01:47:28,849](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m17s)

transform let's just grab this guy right


[01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,889](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m26s)

at the top I generally try to put my


[01:47:28,849 --> 01:47:33,469](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m28s)

properties above my content even though


[01:47:30,889 --> 01:47:35,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m30s)

you can put it above or below and the


[01:47:33,469 --> 01:47:39,889](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m33s)

simplest thing to do


[01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:43,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m35s)

it's a translate transform we'll just


[01:47:39,889 --> 01:47:47,050](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m39s)

give him a name so translate transformed


[01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:49,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m43s)

alright so these guys here have


[01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:53,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m47s)

effectively two properties on them an x


[01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:57,349](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m49s)

and a y now I think for him


[01:47:53,440 --> 01:48:01,639](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m53s)

my translate is x over a hundred 100


[01:47:57,349 --> 01:48:04,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h47m57s)

pixels and because this is the only


[01:48:01,639 --> 01:48:07,360](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m01s)

thing in this grid row he's got that


[01:48:04,909 --> 01:48:09,710](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m04s)

whole space of the window to work with


[01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m07s)

but he's centered so a lot of that space


[01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:14,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m09s)

goes on you so we're just going to shift


[01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:17,630](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m11s)

them to the right 100 pixels and then


[01:48:14,690 --> 01:48:22,789](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m14s)

we'll animate them back across so I


[01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:25,730](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m17s)

think what we do here then as we go just


[01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:33,769](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m22s)

grab this whole block again and we'll do


[01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:39,139](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m25s)

with translate animations and we will go


[01:48:33,769 --> 01:48:42,199](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m33s)

from 100 zero effectively bringing it


[01:48:39,139 --> 01:48:43,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m39s)

back to the center I think we're going


[01:48:42,199 --> 01:48:48,409](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m42s)

to make this one take a little bit


[01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:55,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m43s)

longer and go 400 and this going is


[01:48:48,409 --> 01:49:02,239](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m48s)

going to be let's see translate


[01:48:55,489 --> 01:49:10,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h48m55s)

transform going to be the X property but


[01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:14,090](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m02s)

we want the storyboard set target to be


[01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:17,989](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m10s)

different on this guy and we are going


[01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:26,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m14s)

to do the translate target


[01:49:17,989 --> 01:49:26,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m17s)

form and oops sorry


[01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:33,260](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m27s)

we want to set it on the animation and


[01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:36,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m30s)

we want the value of it to be this


[01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:39,440](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m33s)

instance and then we should add it into


[01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:41,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m36s)

our storyboards so it's worth noting


[01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:43,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m39s)

that the begin time of both of these and


[01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:45,230](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m41s)

the clock is animating are both going to


[01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:49,580](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m43s)

start at zero so it's going to change


[01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:56,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m45s)

the opacity or pasady and translate it


[01:49:49,580 --> 01:50:01,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m49s)

at the same time I think that gets


[01:49:56,570 --> 01:50:01,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h49m56s)

pretty close take a look


[01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:20,990](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m13s)

let's see cannot resolve all property


[01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:22,670](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m17s)

reference is in the property path X oh


[01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:27,410](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m20s)

because we've got two different targets


[01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:33,140](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m22s)

of our storyboard right so let's just do


[01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:35,810](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m27s)

this let's do this and change this guy


[01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:43,610](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m33s)

up because I think if we just change you


[01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:47,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m35s)

over to be the card no set the animation


[01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:49,910](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m43s)

to be the card rather than having the


[01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:51,650](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m47s)

target element be passed in that the


[01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:57,200](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m49s)

storyboard level we'll pass it in on the


[01:50:51,650 --> 01:51:00,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m51s)

individual animation level and then


[01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,310](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h50m57s)

we'll just start the storyboard


[01:51:06,949 --> 01:51:18,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h51m06s)

nope property tax translate transform


[01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:24,070](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h51m19s)

and a proud


[01:51:28,909 --> 01:51:47,659](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h51m28s)

if I click will object support the


[01:51:31,699 --> 01:51:51,409](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h51m31s)

properties what why my oh right right


[01:51:47,659 --> 01:52:00,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h51m47s)

right right right Mary let's go back


[01:51:51,409 --> 01:52:04,010](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h51m51s)

let's go back because the property path


[01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:07,900](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m00s)

actually needs to be relationship to the


[01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:11,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m04s)

card so this is just card dot opacity


[01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:11,830](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m07s)

this should actually be


[01:52:20,659 --> 01:52:28,590](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m20s)

so I got that okay so this property path


[01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:31,500](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m27s)

should actually be in relationship to


[01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:33,179](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m28s)

the card or map down to the card the


[01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:35,639](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m31s)

same way that you might specify it what


[01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:39,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m33s)

you are declaring a binding it's the


[01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:46,739](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m35s)

same object so we actually want card dot


[01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:53,789](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m39s)

render transform and from render


[01:52:46,739 --> 01:52:56,460](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m46s)

transform down into here so what's that


[01:52:53,789 --> 01:52:58,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m53s)

right so this was just card opacity


[01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:01,619](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m56s)

render transform


[01:52:58,429 --> 01:53:05,809](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h52m58s)

translate transform which is the exact


[01:53:01,619 --> 01:53:09,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m01s)

guy in there I think that's what we want


[01:53:05,809 --> 01:53:09,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m05s)

let's try it


[01:53:21,519 --> 01:53:33,389](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m21s)

no must specify a target property for


[01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:36,519](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m28s)

media animation double animation Oh


[01:53:33,389 --> 01:53:42,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m33s)

because I cannot copy and paste


[01:53:36,519 --> 01:53:52,840](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m36s)

correctly or as I usually call it editor


[01:53:42,489 --> 01:53:59,619](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m42s)

inheritance okay so I think we are


[01:53:52,840 --> 01:54:02,079](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m52s)

getting very close and simple animation


[01:53:59,619 --> 01:54:05,860](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h53m59s)

oh that's what I'm talking about


[01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:09,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m02s)

fade slide from the side okay so this


[01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:17,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m05s)

guy needs to be a little bit faster


[01:54:09,269 --> 01:54:17,429](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m09s)

maybe more along the lines of 300 and


[01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:22,929](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m19s)

maybe actually even shorten him up a


[01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:26,969](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m21s)

little bit rather than going from a


[01:54:22,929 --> 01:54:31,269](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m22s)

hundred maybe we'll go from like eighty


[01:54:26,969 --> 01:54:33,239](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m26s)

never I don't think we really need so


[01:54:31,269 --> 01:54:36,159](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m31s)

this guy doesn't need to be set


[01:54:33,239 --> 01:54:38,739](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m33s)

correctly anymore


[01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:40,329](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m36s)

the opacity needs to be set because we


[01:54:38,739 --> 01:54:42,909](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m38s)

want to think hidden before we click the


[01:54:40,329 --> 01:54:44,380](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m40s)

button the first time but that is it


[01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:47,559](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m42s)

really necessary


[01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:48,999](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m44s)

so in this guy we can do the name of by


[01:54:47,559 --> 01:54:50,489](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m47s)

using the class name rather than


[01:54:48,999 --> 01:54:54,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m48s)

instance name


[01:54:50,489 --> 01:54:57,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m50s)

we don't need that anymore and let's see


[01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:57,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h54m54s)

if that looks a little better


[01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:12,470](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m08s)

and that's what I'm talking about a


[01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:21,570](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m13s)

little bit like that and obviously I am


[01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:23,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m18s)

not necessarily a designer and so I know


[01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:25,110](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m21s)

some designers get very picky about


[01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:25,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m23s)

their animations and their key timings


[01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m25s)

and all of that


[01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:29,550](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m25s)

so if you have a designer that's picky


[01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:31,800](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m27s)

about it you are free to control it but


[01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:35,400](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m29s)

I think this at least makes it for a


[01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:37,980](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m31s)

nice simple example on if you wanted to


[01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:40,170](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m35s)

go get that kind of look on a card and


[01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:42,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m37s)

animate it in here's what you need to do


[01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:43,680](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m40s)

with the storyboard if anybody is


[01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:45,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m42s)

interested in seeing exam will


[01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:47,100](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m43s)

equivalent to this I'm happy to spin one


[01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:50,190](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m45s)

that way too


[01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:52,290](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m47s)

might do it is the second element so


[01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:54,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m50s)

that we can see the two comparisons side


[01:55:52,290 --> 01:56:02,660](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m52s)

by side but this is effectively what


[01:55:54,600 --> 01:56:14,340](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h55m54s)

needs to happen so adding animations or


[01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:18,720](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m02s)

card slide what I call this okay with


[01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:21,510](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m14s)

that I think it is approaching bedtime


[01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,750](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m18s)

for me so thank you guys for jumping in


[01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:28,020](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m21s)

like I said I'm going to get that other


[01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:30,690](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m23s)

seeming PR merged I'll get the DevOps


[01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:32,760](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m28s)

pipeline fixed here the next day or two


[01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:34,920](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m30s)

and get that merged in and then I I know


[01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:37,890](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m32s)

that there is a swath of pull requests


[01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:40,560](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m34s)

that need to get reviewed and merged in


[01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:42,270](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m37s)

so we will hopefully get some of those


[01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:45,210](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m40s)

merged in before next week but I am


[01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:48,600](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m42s)

planning on doing this next week at the


[01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:51,150](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m45s)

same time so thank you guys for coming


[01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:53,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m48s)

in and have a good week we'll see you


[01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:53,390](https://youtu.be/SNdczp6FZ2o?t=01h56m51s)

next time
